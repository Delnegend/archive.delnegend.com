1
00:00:00,091 --> 00:00:03,4
LUCIFER:
Previously on Lucifer...

2
00:00:03,067 --> 00:00:04,5
Container went missing.

3
00:00:04,075 --> 00:00:06,1
Security cameras were disabled.

4
00:00:07,038 --> 00:00:08,1
What container?

5
00:00:08,034 --> 00:00:09,6
The container.

6
00:00:09,084 --> 00:00:10,8
Your return to the Underworld

7
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:12,0
has been requested.

8
00:00:12,026 --> 00:00:13,7
Remind Dad

9
00:00:13,093 --> 00:00:15,2
that I quit Hell
because I was sick and tired

10
00:00:15,047 --> 00:00:16,9
of playing a part in His play.

11
00:00:17,018 --> 00:00:18,7
CHLOE: There was a case,
a shooting on Palmetto Street.

12
00:00:18,097 --> 00:00:19,9
Malcom got shot

13
00:00:20,018 --> 00:00:21,5
meeting up
with some gang members.

14
00:00:21,077 --> 00:00:23,3
Paolucci thinks he took
the bullet like a hero.

15
00:00:23,052 --> 00:00:24,5
I think he was on the take.

16
00:00:24,077 --> 00:00:27,0
Now, no one wants
to work with me.

17
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,3
You give me what is mine!

18
00:00:31,053 --> 00:00:32,5
Oh, God.

19
00:00:32,078 --> 00:00:33,8
Who stole them?

20
00:00:34,003 --> 00:00:35,0
They were yours.

21
00:00:35,024 --> 00:00:36,3
No, don't!

22
00:00:37,074 --> 00:00:38,9
LUCIFER:
Someone's got them,

23
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,7
Mazikeen.

24
00:00:40,091 --> 00:00:43,7
Someone's got my wings.

(coughing)

58
00:02:22,081 --> 00:02:23,6
LUCIFER:
Hello, Sergei.

59
00:02:23,081 --> 00:02:24,9
Waters a bit rough, are they?

60
00:02:25,014 --> 00:02:26,6
What-what the hell
are you doing?

61
00:02:26,089 --> 00:02:28,0
Isn't it obvious?

62
00:02:28,027 --> 00:02:29,6
I'm going to brutally
torture you

63
00:02:29,085 --> 00:02:30,6
until you give me
what I want.

64
00:02:30,086 --> 00:02:32,6
My wings-- where are they?

65
00:02:32,082 --> 00:02:34,9
What wings? I don't even know
what you're talking about!

66
00:02:36,007 --> 00:02:36,9
Why do they always

67
00:02:37,015 --> 00:02:39,4
insist on being so difficult?

68
00:02:39,066 --> 00:02:40,9
- (chuckles)
- All right.

69
00:02:41,016 --> 00:02:42,1
(gasps)

70
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:43,2
As you can see,

71
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:44,2
I'm not playing,

72
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:45,2
so let's try again,

73
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,7
shall we?

74
00:02:46,091 --> 00:02:48,5
My wings, please.

75
00:02:48,075 --> 00:02:50,6
Look, man, why would I take
your wings?

76
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,2
I don't even know
who you are!

77
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,1
I'm Lucifer Morningstar.

78
00:02:54,038 --> 00:02:56,1
And you,
you small-peckered fool,

79
00:02:56,034 --> 00:02:58,6
are Sergei Bok,
a known smuggler.

80
00:02:58,084 --> 00:03:00,0
You move just about anything

81
00:03:00,022 --> 00:03:01,3
you can get
your trashy Euro hands on.

82
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,6
Please, man!

83
00:03:02,085 --> 00:03:05,0
I don't have 'em!
I swear.

84
00:03:05,022 --> 00:03:06,5
Okay? I don't know what
I'd do with a pair...

85
00:03:07,073 --> 00:03:09,5
Maybe if I hit him a few times?

86
00:03:09,077 --> 00:03:11,8
Though I hate to say it,

87
00:03:12,002 --> 00:03:13,9
I'm not sure violence is
the trick here.

88
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:15,8
I'm beginning to wonder

89
00:03:16,003 --> 00:03:17,8
if this human stain is actually
telling the truth.

90
00:03:18,007 --> 00:03:19,4
No! He's scum.

91
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:20,9
He'll say anything.

92
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,4
Maybe it's not him, it's us.

93
00:03:22,066 --> 00:03:23,9
Us?

94
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,2
He's the fifth man
we've accosted this week.

95
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:28,1
Perhaps we're-- dare I say it--

96
00:03:28,037 --> 00:03:30,1
going about this wrong?

97
00:03:30,033 --> 00:03:31,6
(sighs)

98
00:03:31,088 --> 00:03:34,4
It may be time to seek the help
of a professional.

99
00:03:34,063 --> 00:03:35,6
(sighs)

100
00:03:35,088 --> 00:03:37,5
Oh!

101
00:03:37,071 --> 00:03:39,5
Maze!

102
00:03:40,068 --> 00:03:41,8
(gasps)

103
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,0
(coughing)

104
00:03:47,081 --> 00:03:49,3
Hey.

105
00:03:49,052 --> 00:03:50,4
I don't know that you want
to be here right now.

106
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:51,9
DETECTIVE:
There she is.

107
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,2
Yeah. What, do I have
a "hate me" sign on my face?

108
00:03:54,044 --> 00:03:56,0
If only it were that simple.

109
00:03:56,023 --> 00:03:57,7
It's about Malcolm.

110
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,0
What about him?

111
00:03:59,028 --> 00:04:00,9
That guy's been
in a coma for months.

112
00:04:01,011 --> 00:04:02,9
His wife decided
to pull the plug.

113
00:04:04,012 --> 00:04:05,5
Malcolm's dying today,

114
00:04:05,074 --> 00:04:08,0
and you're still investigating
him for corruption.

115
00:04:08,029 --> 00:04:09,8
So, what,
they hate me even more

116
00:04:10,004 --> 00:04:11,1
now that I won't put a halo
on his head?

117
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:12,1
Maybe stay away

118
00:04:12,033 --> 00:04:14,0
from the precinct tonight.

119
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:15,7
Cops are staging
a living wake here.

120
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,0
Anything else?

121
00:04:22,059 --> 00:04:24,3
It would make
everyone's life easier

122
00:04:24,059 --> 00:04:26,5
if you would close
your investigation.

123
00:04:26,076 --> 00:04:27,8
You know, Dan,
I thought we were actually

124
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,6
making progress there
for a second,

125
00:04:29,081 --> 00:04:31,9
but once again, look who's
on Team Everyone Else.

126
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,4
- I'm trying to protect you.
- From what?

127
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:37,2
Catching a criminal
or hurting your rep?

128
00:04:39,032 --> 00:04:41,3
It's not about any of that.
It's about Malcolm's family.

129
00:04:41,053 --> 00:04:43,4
If there's an open investigation
calling for his dismissal,

130
00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:44,7
it can cost them his benefits,

131
00:04:44,095 --> 00:04:46,2
his pension, all of it.

132
00:04:46,045 --> 00:04:48,4
So, what,
you want me to just drop it?

133
00:04:48,062 --> 00:04:50,8
Just turn my back
on everything I stand for?

134
00:04:51,004 --> 00:04:52,5
No.

135
00:04:52,071 --> 00:04:53,9
I'm saying if you want
to do something about it,

136
00:04:54,017 --> 00:04:54,9
then do it now.

137
00:04:55,017 --> 00:04:56,2
You have 24 hours.

138
00:04:57,071 --> 00:04:59,6
Or let it go and let
his family move on.

139
00:05:19,098 --> 00:05:21,9
Is this really what you do
in your spare time?

140
00:05:23,011 --> 00:05:25,1
How fascinatingly morose.

141
00:05:25,032 --> 00:05:26,5
Do you ever think
of taking up knitting?

142
00:05:27,066 --> 00:05:29,1
What are you doing here?

143
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:32,5
I'm here because I could really
use your expertise.

144
00:05:32,075 --> 00:05:34,6
You're not busy, are you?

145
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,1
Actually, shocker, I am busy.

146
00:05:36,033 --> 00:05:38,0
And it's really not a good day

147
00:05:38,021 --> 00:05:39,9
for... your... Luciferness.

148
00:05:40,017 --> 00:05:41,1
Hmm?

149
00:05:41,034 --> 00:05:42,5
Here's an idea.

150
00:05:42,071 --> 00:05:43,6
- Call next time.
- No, no, no.

151
00:05:43,084 --> 00:05:46,0
Hold on.

152
00:05:46,026 --> 00:05:49,0
Now, I'm not one to get
into the feels, usually, but...

153
00:05:49,022 --> 00:05:51,0
you seem genuinely distressed.

154
00:05:52,006 --> 00:05:53,0
You okay?

155
00:05:53,022 --> 00:05:54,3
Do you want to--
I don't know--

156
00:05:54,052 --> 00:05:56,6
chat about it or something?

157
00:05:56,085 --> 00:05:57,5
Sex is always

158
00:05:57,073 --> 00:05:58,7
on the table.

159
00:05:58,098 --> 00:05:59,9
(scoffs)

160
00:06:00,011 --> 00:06:01,0
You never quit, do you?

161
00:06:01,023 --> 00:06:02,8
(laughs) No.

162
00:06:03,003 --> 00:06:04,6
I'm simply offering an ear.

163
00:06:06,015 --> 00:06:07,5
Come on.

164
00:06:07,078 --> 00:06:09,4
(sighs)

165
00:06:09,066 --> 00:06:11,4
Remember the Palmetto case
I was telling you about?

166
00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:14,1
The case that's been
consuming you,

167
00:06:14,037 --> 00:06:15,2
causing people to despise you,

168
00:06:15,046 --> 00:06:16,8
call you names--
I even quarreled

169
00:06:17,004 --> 00:06:18,2
upon occasion because of it?

170
00:06:18,046 --> 00:06:19,9
No, doesn't ring a bell.

171
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:21,5
(chuckles)

172
00:06:21,075 --> 00:06:23,0
Well, they're pressuring me
to drop the case,

173
00:06:23,021 --> 00:06:24,0
assume the party line,

174
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:25,3
and say the guy died a hero.

175
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,6
My spidey sense tells me

176
00:06:26,088 --> 00:06:29,0
dropping it's not what you want,
is it?

177
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:30,3
I want the truth.

178
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,4
Well, then seek it out.

179
00:06:31,064 --> 00:06:32,9
You're a police officer.

180
00:06:33,014 --> 00:06:34,1
You don't need
anyone's permission.

181
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:35,5
Hmm.

182
00:06:35,077 --> 00:06:37,3
That's decent-ish advice.

183
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,5
I know. I'm quite good.

184
00:06:39,073 --> 00:06:41,0
Anyway, now we've helped you,
my turn.

185
00:06:41,023 --> 00:06:43,4
See, I'm working a sort of case
of my own.

186
00:06:43,061 --> 00:06:44,8
And it seems that I've...

187
00:06:45,007 --> 00:06:46,8
Well, hit a bit of a snag.

188
00:06:47,095 --> 00:06:49,0
A case?

189
00:06:49,028 --> 00:06:50,2
(chuckles) Um...

190
00:06:50,049 --> 00:06:51,5
What kind of case is it?

191
00:06:51,074 --> 00:06:52,8
Well, the nature
of the investigation

192
00:06:53,003 --> 00:06:54,2
isn't important.

193
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,3
I'm strictly here
for professional advice.

194
00:06:56,054 --> 00:06:59,3
What do you do
when your case hits a wall?

195
00:06:59,058 --> 00:07:00,7
Mmm.

196
00:07:00,092 --> 00:07:03,3
- What do I do when
I get stuck?
- Yes.

197
00:07:03,059 --> 00:07:05,6
Well, I grab a pair
of fresh eyes--

198
00:07:05,088 --> 00:07:08,0
someone who's not gonna be
afraid to be honest with me,

199
00:07:08,026 --> 00:07:10,7
even if it's not
what I want to hear.

200
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,8
Hello.

201
00:07:12,005 --> 00:07:13,8
That's a brilliant idea.

202
00:07:14,006 --> 00:07:15,0
Yeah.

203
00:07:15,026 --> 00:07:16,9
It kinda is.

204
00:07:17,014 --> 00:07:18,4
So...

205
00:07:18,068 --> 00:07:20,6
maybe if you help me,

206
00:07:20,081 --> 00:07:21,9
I could help you.

207
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:23,5
(door creaking)

208
00:07:23,077 --> 00:07:24,9
Could...

209
00:07:25,015 --> 00:07:26,5
And Bob's your uncle.

210
00:07:26,073 --> 00:07:27,5
Right.

211
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,2
What are we doing here, Lucifer?

212
00:07:41,042 --> 00:07:43,4
I like to come here
from time to time.

213
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:45,0
Dip my toes in the sand,

214
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:46,7
breathe the ocean air,

215
00:07:46,096 --> 00:07:48,7
walk down memory lane.

216
00:07:48,097 --> 00:07:49,8
(chuckles)

217
00:07:50,097 --> 00:07:51,8
You see,

218
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,0
five years ago,

219
00:07:53,026 --> 00:07:54,4
when Maze
and I abandoned Hell,

220
00:07:54,064 --> 00:07:57,1
I landed right here
on this beach.

221
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,6
This is where I flipped
dear old Dad

222
00:08:00,085 --> 00:08:02,4
the grandest of birds.

223
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,4
And had Maze sever my wings.

224
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:07,9
And why are you
telling me this?

225
00:08:08,015 --> 00:08:09,4
Honestly,
why summon me here at all?

226
00:08:09,065 --> 00:08:11,9
Surely it's not just
to reminisce.

227
00:08:12,011 --> 00:08:14,1
(chuckles)

228
00:08:14,037 --> 00:08:16,7
I've asked you here
because those same wings

229
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:18,4
have been stolen.

230
00:08:20,012 --> 00:08:23,0
And I need your help
to get them back.

231
00:08:28,059 --> 00:08:30,3
♪ Oh! ♪

232
00:08:36,064 --> 00:08:38,0
Your wings are missing?

233
00:08:38,026 --> 00:08:40,2
Sorry, is there an echo?
Isn't that what I just said?

234
00:08:40,043 --> 00:08:42,2
What exactly am I supposed
to do with that news?

235
00:08:42,044 --> 00:08:43,9
Use your angelic powers

236
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:45,9
to soar around the city
and find them.

237
00:08:46,011 --> 00:08:47,1
I mean, really,

238
00:08:47,032 --> 00:08:48,3
what good's an angel

239
00:08:48,052 --> 00:08:49,9
if he can't help a brother out?

240
00:08:50,011 --> 00:08:51,4
Am I right?

241
00:08:53,007 --> 00:08:54,4
Lucy,

242
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,2
since your grand departure
from Hell,

243
00:08:56,049 --> 00:08:58,6
I've been the one
that's had to patrol the gates,

244
00:08:58,087 --> 00:09:00,4
I've been the one
keeping damned souls

245
00:09:00,066 --> 00:09:03,9
from slipping loose-- a job,
by the way, that I loathe.

246
00:09:04,017 --> 00:09:05,4
- I didn't ask for that.
- But those wings

247
00:09:05,067 --> 00:09:07,5
out there in the human world?

248
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:08,9
Lucy, they're too powerful.

249
00:09:09,013 --> 00:09:10,4
A piece of divinity.

250
00:09:10,063 --> 00:09:12,7
Humanity can't
handle them.

251
00:09:12,097 --> 00:09:14,5
And if they fall
into the wrong hands...

252
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,4
Then people might die?
Yeah, I get that.

253
00:09:16,064 --> 00:09:18,4
Just saw a chap toss himself
off a building

254
00:09:18,064 --> 00:09:21,1
after a mere peek at them, so if
you're done telling me things

255
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:23,1
I already know...

256
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:27,4
...will you help me or not?

257
00:09:27,061 --> 00:09:29,1
You tell me something.

258
00:09:29,032 --> 00:09:30,5
If you truly hated the wings,

259
00:09:30,073 --> 00:09:32,2
why'd you hold onto them
all this time?

260
00:09:32,049 --> 00:09:34,7
(chuckles)

261
00:09:34,099 --> 00:09:37,3
- That is none of your business.
- It's a sentimental
move, Lucy.

262
00:09:37,053 --> 00:09:38,7
Especially for someone
that was trying

263
00:09:38,099 --> 00:09:39,8
to leave their
life behind.

264
00:09:40,003 --> 00:09:41,7
Please. Here we go.

265
00:09:41,091 --> 00:09:44,5
Maybe deep down you realize you
never should've cut them off.

266
00:09:44,071 --> 00:09:45,9
And maybe that's why

267
00:09:46,017 --> 00:09:47,6
you left yourself an out.

268
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:49,2
Yeah.

269
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,6
So are you done?

270
00:09:50,084 --> 00:09:52,7
Pretty words, but no.

271
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,7
They're my property.
I want them back.

272
00:09:54,092 --> 00:09:56,2
Simple as that.
If I can avoid

273
00:09:56,043 --> 00:09:59,0
an earth-shattering tragedy
as well-- bonus.

274
00:09:59,022 --> 00:10:01,0
You wanted free will.

275
00:10:03,014 --> 00:10:04,6
You wanted accountability.

276
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:06,8
Well...

277
00:10:07,002 --> 00:10:09,5
fix your own damn mess,
for once.

278
00:10:18,099 --> 00:10:20,1
(chuckles) I've been thinking.

279
00:10:20,032 --> 00:10:21,8
Your problem, my problem--

280
00:10:22,008 --> 00:10:24,7
why not be each other's
fresh eyes and all that?

281
00:10:24,095 --> 00:10:26,5
Hey, what do you say,
quid pro quo?

282
00:10:26,075 --> 00:10:28,6
Oh, so now you need my help.

283
00:10:28,087 --> 00:10:30,6
Sorry, am I not
enunciating today?

284
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:33,5
Yes, I've come seeking
your very generous aid.

285
00:10:33,075 --> 00:10:35,7
First you have to tell me
what it is you're working on.

286
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,8
(chuckles)

287
00:10:37,005 --> 00:10:38,4
I'm not sure you can handle it.

288
00:10:38,068 --> 00:10:39,5
Try me.

289
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:41,5
Okay.

290
00:10:41,072 --> 00:10:43,0
Uh, remember that container

291
00:10:43,022 --> 00:10:44,3
that was so inelegantly
taken from me?

292
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,9
The one I was convinced

293
00:10:46,018 --> 00:10:47,5
- was hiding something?
- Yes, well, it wasn't just

294
00:10:47,077 --> 00:10:49,1
nesting dolls
that I was looking for.

295
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,4
There was something else,
something... personal

296
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:54,0
that was missing
when we got there.

297
00:10:54,023 --> 00:10:55,3
I knew it.

298
00:10:55,057 --> 00:10:57,7
Lucifer, what was in there?

299
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,2
My angel wings.

300
00:11:00,049 --> 00:11:01,3
(laughs)

301
00:11:01,053 --> 00:11:02,5
(chuckles)
Yeah, go on.

302
00:11:02,074 --> 00:11:03,7
Get it all out.

303
00:11:03,091 --> 00:11:04,7
(laughing):
Okay, seriously,

304
00:11:04,095 --> 00:11:06,0
what was in there?

305
00:11:09,037 --> 00:11:10,7
Oh, you are serious?

306
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,4
Oh... okay, sorry.

307
00:11:13,067 --> 00:11:15,1
Did someone make them for you?

308
00:11:15,034 --> 00:11:18,0
Or are you big into cosplay?

309
00:11:18,026 --> 00:11:19,0
You're enjoying this,
aren't you?

310
00:11:19,026 --> 00:11:20,2
Sorry, I'll admit

311
00:11:20,043 --> 00:11:22,2
I don't always get you.

312
00:11:22,043 --> 00:11:24,3
But if this is
really that important--

313
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,0
It is.

314
00:11:26,022 --> 00:11:27,9
Okay, I will do what I can.

315
00:11:28,014 --> 00:11:30,6
I will put out an APB on...

316
00:11:32,006 --> 00:11:33,9
...angel wings.

317
00:11:34,011 --> 00:11:35,5
Thank you,
and in return,

318
00:11:35,073 --> 00:11:37,9
I shall donate my services
on Palmetto, all right?

319
00:11:38,011 --> 00:11:39,1
Sure, we could use the help.

320
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,6
(door opens)
"We"?

321
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:43,0
- Hey.
- Ready to go?

322
00:11:43,028 --> 00:11:44,9
Yeah, you weren't
around to help,

323
00:11:45,012 --> 00:11:46,3
so I recruited someone else.

324
00:11:46,058 --> 00:11:47,3
The more, the merrier.

325
00:11:47,058 --> 00:11:48,4
You're helping her?

326
00:11:48,066 --> 00:11:50,7
I knew she wouldn't give it up.

327
00:11:50,092 --> 00:11:51,9
And I couldn't let
her go it alone,

328
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:54,2
so I'm here for the ride.

329
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,6
Hmm.

330
00:11:55,084 --> 00:11:56,9
Cool.

331
00:11:57,013 --> 00:11:58,5
The three of us
working together.

332
00:11:58,076 --> 00:12:00,0
Yes, cool.

333
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,7
What could be better?

334
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:07,0
♪ Bursting inside ♪

335
00:12:07,022 --> 00:12:08,7
♪ It's getting harder
to hide... ♪

336
00:12:08,097 --> 00:12:11,6
So, this is Palmetto Street.

337
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,4
I'm sorry,
why is he here again?

338
00:12:15,065 --> 00:12:18,6
Uh, he helps me
see things differently.

339
00:12:18,082 --> 00:12:22,1
Yes, I've proved myself
quite useful, Dan.

340
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:24,4
So, how can we help you?

341
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:26,0
All right, I want
to reenact the shooting.

342
00:12:26,024 --> 00:12:27,2
I want to figure out
what I missed.

343
00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:28,6
How's that gonna prove anything?

344
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:31,4
- Just humor me, thanks.
- (chuckles)

345
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:33,6
- Lucifer?
- Yes?

346
00:12:33,087 --> 00:12:34,8
You will represent the seedy

347
00:12:35,008 --> 00:12:36,6
criminal element.

348
00:12:36,084 --> 00:12:38,6
Oh, I believe you mean
handsome criminal element.

349
00:12:38,084 --> 00:12:40,3
(Dan scoffs)
And, Dan,

350
00:12:40,055 --> 00:12:42,4
you will stand for Malcolm.

351
00:12:42,068 --> 00:12:43,5
The tough as nails cop,

352
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,7
who wishes I would

353
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,1
leave this stupid case alone.

354
00:12:46,035 --> 00:12:47,6
Ah, cute.

355
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:49,2
And I will play myself.

356
00:12:49,043 --> 00:12:51,7
A chick who cannot figure out
what the hell I saw.

357
00:12:51,098 --> 00:12:53,2
So in the months
leading up to the shooting,

358
00:12:53,044 --> 00:12:54,9
we were following
a French drug trafficker

359
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:56,3
Nikolas Aoudi.

360
00:12:56,056 --> 00:12:57,9
Ooh, can I have a gun?

361
00:12:58,015 --> 00:12:59,4
I feel like Nikolas
would definitely have a gun.

362
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:00,8
No...

363
00:13:01,003 --> 00:13:02,1
Actually he was
more of a hammer guy.

364
00:13:02,036 --> 00:13:03,4
Liked to break
fingers and arms.

365
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,1
- Okay--
- Some legs and teeth.

366
00:13:05,036 --> 00:13:07,4
Right.
Can I have a hammer, then?

367
00:13:07,066 --> 00:13:10,1
Somehow Aoudi
kept evading the LAPD.

368
00:13:10,033 --> 00:13:12,2
I arrested one of his guys,
thought he was gonna flip.

369
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:14,0
Then suddenly
he changed his tune.

370
00:13:14,025 --> 00:13:16,0
The only cop
who spoke to him was Malcolm.

371
00:13:16,025 --> 00:13:17,2
So...

372
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:20,0
one night, I tracked him here,

373
00:13:20,021 --> 00:13:22,2
sneaking in
through the side door.

374
00:13:22,042 --> 00:13:25,0
And I hid behind this glass.

375
00:13:25,022 --> 00:13:27,1
I could see them.

376
00:13:27,034 --> 00:13:29,5
It was Malcolm and Aoudi
and his bodyguard.

377
00:13:29,072 --> 00:13:32,0
They looked like
they were making a deal.

378
00:13:32,022 --> 00:13:34,0
Malcolm was holding cash.

379
00:13:34,023 --> 00:13:35,3
Hold on.

380
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,4
(grunts)
Ooh, is that enough?

381
00:13:37,069 --> 00:13:39,6
CHLOE: A bribe, maybe.

382
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,8
I'm not sure.

383
00:13:42,007 --> 00:13:44,1
But I leaned forward to hear
what they were saying.

384
00:13:44,036 --> 00:13:45,9
(glass rattles)
And accidentally,

385
00:13:46,011 --> 00:13:46,9
I made a sound.

386
00:13:47,016 --> 00:13:48,1
I could feel it.

387
00:13:48,032 --> 00:13:49,8
He saw me, but he didn't react.

388
00:13:50,008 --> 00:13:52,2
He just went back
to his conversation.

389
00:13:52,045 --> 00:13:53,2
And that's
when the shot went off.

390
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:55,1
(gunshots)

391
00:13:55,037 --> 00:13:56,8
It didn't take long before
bullets were flying everywhere.

392
00:13:57,008 --> 00:13:59,3
I braced behind the door,

393
00:13:59,054 --> 00:14:01,5
and that's when I ran in.

394
00:14:01,075 --> 00:14:03,9
Aoudi and his man were dead.

395
00:14:04,013 --> 00:14:06,5
Malcolm was on the floor,
bleeding out.

396
00:14:10,005 --> 00:14:11,6
There was nothing you could do.

397
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,8
It doesn't make sense.

398
00:14:19,002 --> 00:14:20,1
Excuse me?

399
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,9
Aoudi would have
no desire to kill Malcolm.

400
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:24,4
Trust me, if there's one
thing I know, it's desire.

401
00:14:24,061 --> 00:14:27,5
I mean, if Malcolm
were indeed corrupt,

402
00:14:27,078 --> 00:14:29,0
he'd be Aoudi's golden goose.

403
00:14:29,028 --> 00:14:30,6
It'd be quite dumb to shoot him.

404
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,4
What if someone else was here?

405
00:14:32,062 --> 00:14:34,9
The cops searched
the place up and down, Chloe.

406
00:14:35,016 --> 00:14:36,4
There was no one else.

407
00:14:36,066 --> 00:14:39,5
Look, you may not
want to believe it,

408
00:14:39,075 --> 00:14:41,4
but what if--?

409
00:14:41,063 --> 00:14:42,4
I was wrong.

410
00:14:42,063 --> 00:14:45,4
(cell phone ringing)

411
00:14:45,067 --> 00:14:47,3
Espinoza.

412
00:14:47,051 --> 00:14:48,9
Uh, yeah.

413
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,8
Okay, I will let her know.

414
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,2
Did you really put out

415
00:14:53,043 --> 00:14:56,4
an APB for... angel wings?

416
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,1
Maybe.

417
00:15:00,031 --> 00:15:02,5
Well, it looks
like they got a hit.

418
00:15:02,077 --> 00:15:03,9
Excellent!

419
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:05,8
Right, my turn.

420
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:12,3
I still can't believe it
that the wings are--

421
00:15:12,058 --> 00:15:14,9
Real? Exquisite? Divine?

422
00:15:15,024 --> 00:15:16,2
It's okay to say it.

423
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,9
I was gonna say,
"For sale."

424
00:15:18,012 --> 00:15:20,0
So, anything else the FBI
can tell us, Agent Pitts?

425
00:15:20,025 --> 00:15:21,7
The wings-- along
with a bunch of other crap

426
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,7
people think is real--
are being pawned off

427
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,3
at a black-market
antiquities auction.

428
00:15:25,055 --> 00:15:26,9
An auction?

429
00:15:27,017 --> 00:15:28,5
Held under the veil of
a charity event at Crimson Hall.

430
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,8
Saints' teeth?

431
00:15:30,001 --> 00:15:31,1
Holy napkins?

432
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:32,8
Oh, a piece of the cross?

433
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:34,6
They've got my wings
in absurdly fraudulent company.

434
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:37,2
Yeah, unlike the wings,
there's no way those are real.

435
00:15:37,047 --> 00:15:39,1
Exactly, it's insulting!

436
00:15:39,031 --> 00:15:40,7
Putting my wings on the block
like some chintzy accoutrement.

437
00:15:40,098 --> 00:15:42,4
All right.

438
00:15:42,065 --> 00:15:44,0
Well, you can take comfort
knowing the auction's

439
00:15:44,023 --> 00:15:46,3
already set
to be raided tonight.

440
00:15:46,053 --> 00:15:48,2
So the FBI are gonna
snatch my wings?

441
00:15:48,044 --> 00:15:49,9
When we get a chance to pounce
on the bad guys, we take it.

442
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,6
The FBI is taking lead.

443
00:15:51,086 --> 00:15:53,0
Figured you might be
after the same guys.

444
00:15:53,024 --> 00:15:54,7
And we have jurisdiction.

445
00:15:54,099 --> 00:15:57,1
Okay, so how do we get
the wings back?

446
00:15:57,037 --> 00:15:58,7
After the raid?

447
00:15:58,091 --> 00:16:00,0
As long as you can prove
the wings' provenance,

448
00:16:00,021 --> 00:16:01,2
you'll get it back in 30 days.

449
00:16:01,042 --> 00:16:03,3
- No problem.
- 30 days.

450
00:16:03,054 --> 00:16:05,3
Yes, no problem,
no problem at all.

451
00:16:05,054 --> 00:16:06,4
Right?

452
00:16:06,067 --> 00:16:08,5
(quietly):
Mm-hmm.

453
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,2
♪♪

454
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:24,4
(elevator bell dings)

455
00:16:29,078 --> 00:16:31,7
(laughs)

456
00:16:31,099 --> 00:16:33,8
Come on out, Amenadiel.

457
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:39,0
So what happened
to going it alone,

458
00:16:39,024 --> 00:16:40,6
lying in my own mess
and such?

459
00:16:40,087 --> 00:16:42,4
Or did you just want
a front row seat to the action?

460
00:16:42,062 --> 00:16:43,9
I assure you, Lucifer,

461
00:16:44,012 --> 00:16:45,6
I take no pleasure in
following you around.

462
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:48,4
But this is far too important
to let you screw up.

463
00:16:48,067 --> 00:16:51,4
Ah, so you just
came to help?

464
00:16:51,063 --> 00:16:54,0
I came to ensure the wings
get back where they belong.

465
00:16:54,026 --> 00:16:55,6
Which is where exactly?

466
00:16:55,089 --> 00:16:57,1
You mean besides
on your back?

467
00:16:57,035 --> 00:16:58,6
Oh, surely,
my fine-feathered friend,

468
00:16:58,081 --> 00:17:00,1
you don't expect
that to happen.

469
00:17:00,035 --> 00:17:03,3
They belong in the Heavens
where they were created.

470
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,0
If you don't want them,
that's where they'll be.

471
00:17:06,023 --> 00:17:09,0
Fair enough.

472
00:17:09,023 --> 00:17:10,6
Considering
we're on a clock now,

473
00:17:10,082 --> 00:17:11,6
I could use a wingman.

474
00:17:11,082 --> 00:17:13,4
What do you mean?

475
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:15,5
The FBI's raiding the place.

476
00:17:15,074 --> 00:17:18,4
So if we don't get the wings,
humanity finds divinity,

477
00:17:18,066 --> 00:17:20,4
so on and so forth--
you know the rest.

478
00:17:20,066 --> 00:17:22,0
Well, we can't
let that happen.

479
00:17:22,029 --> 00:17:24,2
Right, so you can join.

480
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,5
Provided, of course,
you can keep

481
00:17:25,075 --> 00:17:27,7
that angelic ego
of yours in check.

482
00:17:27,092 --> 00:17:29,2
I don't have an ego.

483
00:17:29,046 --> 00:17:31,4
Sure you do, but I'm
encouraging you to get off

484
00:17:31,063 --> 00:17:33,7
that high horse and learn
a thing or two about humanity.

485
00:17:33,097 --> 00:17:36,6
Though it appears that you've
picked up a fashion sense.

486
00:17:36,084 --> 00:17:38,0
So that's, uh... (sighs)

487
00:17:38,022 --> 00:17:40,2
I miss the dress.

488
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,3
(beeping)

489
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,3
Hello.

490
00:17:47,052 --> 00:17:48,7
Private party.

491
00:17:48,094 --> 00:17:51,1
(stammers) Honey, not vinegar.

492
00:17:52,044 --> 00:17:54,0
Yes, excuse me, I understand

493
00:17:54,028 --> 00:17:55,4
this event is very exclusive.

494
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:59,0
But, uh, surely
you've got room for just

495
00:17:59,028 --> 00:18:00,6
two more?

496
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:05,1
Unless you got business here,
scram.

497
00:18:10,084 --> 00:18:13,0
It's funny you should
say that, actually.

498
00:18:13,021 --> 00:18:15,3
Perhaps I do have something
that might interest

499
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:18,2
those keen on religious relics.

500
00:18:24,081 --> 00:18:26,0
Right this way, gentlemen.

501
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:27,6
Thank you.

502
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:29,7
Did you catch all that?

503
00:18:35,065 --> 00:18:37,4
CHLOE: (sighs) I can't believe
I agreed to this.

504
00:18:37,061 --> 00:18:38,9
I thought you
were helping me.

505
00:18:39,016 --> 00:18:40,2
I am helping.

506
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,4
We went to Palmetto,
right?

507
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,7
We went over
everything that happened.

508
00:18:42,091 --> 00:18:45,5
And found nothing.
Exactly.

509
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:48,3
Now I want to show you
who your case is about.

510
00:18:48,054 --> 00:18:50,3
(sighs)

511
00:18:50,054 --> 00:18:52,5
This is who's on
the other end of this case.

512
00:18:52,071 --> 00:18:53,8
Not a monster.

513
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:55,3
Not a villain.

514
00:18:55,059 --> 00:18:58,1
But a grieving family
trying to say goodbye.

515
00:18:59,051 --> 00:19:01,4
(groans)
She saw us.

516
00:19:05,093 --> 00:19:07,3
What is she doing here?

517
00:19:07,056 --> 00:19:08,9
I'm sorry, Mel.

518
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:10,5
She's not, she's not
looking for a fight.

519
00:19:10,073 --> 00:19:12,3
(scoffs) Are you kidding?

520
00:19:12,052 --> 00:19:13,6
A fight?

521
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:15,5
She...

522
00:19:15,073 --> 00:19:18,5
You have no right.

523
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:20,2
What do you want from us?

524
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,2
(sighs)

525
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:24,9
I'm-I'm so sorry for your loss.

526
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,5
(scoffs)

527
00:19:27,075 --> 00:19:30,0
Just go.

528
00:19:30,029 --> 00:19:32,1
Please, just...

529
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:35,9
(door closes)

530
00:19:37,088 --> 00:19:40,5
Carmen?

531
00:19:40,072 --> 00:19:42,5
It's like nothing
I've ever seen.

532
00:19:50,073 --> 00:19:53,4
Congratulations,
Mr. Morningstar.

533
00:19:53,069 --> 00:19:57,5
The Catholics and the Satanists
will be clawing for this coin.

534
00:19:57,073 --> 00:20:00,5
With any luck, we may even have
a bidding war on our hands.

535
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:02,2
Wouldn't that be fun?

536
00:20:02,045 --> 00:20:04,1
Who would've thought, eh,
the devil's coin,

537
00:20:04,032 --> 00:20:06,6
- worthy of so much love?
- Put a bunch of
believers in a room

538
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:10,3
and-- pardon the pun--
but sky's the limit. (chuckles)

539
00:20:10,054 --> 00:20:11,6
(chuckles)
That's very good.

540
00:20:11,087 --> 00:20:13,3
If I didn't know
any better, I would say

541
00:20:13,054 --> 00:20:16,0
that you don't respect
your buyers' faith.

542
00:20:16,025 --> 00:20:17,5
Oh, quite
the contrary.

543
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,9
I respect my customers'
faith very much.

544
00:20:20,013 --> 00:20:21,4
But I don't have to share
in their beliefs

545
00:20:21,063 --> 00:20:23,3
to profit from them.
(chuckles)

546
00:20:23,051 --> 00:20:26,3
So I take it
you're not a believer then?

547
00:20:26,051 --> 00:20:29,6
I'm a man that believes
in one simple divinity,

548
00:20:29,085 --> 00:20:31,7
the almighty dollar.

549
00:20:31,098 --> 00:20:33,3
(laughter)

550
00:20:35,065 --> 00:20:37,9
Humans.

551
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,7
Am I right?
(clears throat)

552
00:20:39,099 --> 00:20:42,1
I have to admit,

553
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:45,2
I love being the bearer
of bad news.

554
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:47,4
Oh? Do tell.

555
00:20:47,066 --> 00:20:49,1
The coin's not for sale.

556
00:20:49,037 --> 00:20:52,0
I simply used it
to gain entrée to you.

557
00:20:52,025 --> 00:20:54,1
Then why are you here?

558
00:20:54,037 --> 00:20:55,7
Someone stole my wings.

559
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,3
About six feet,
glow with the light of God.

560
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:02,1
So if you'd be so kind as
to deliver them, then we can be

561
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:03,8
on our way
without any...

562
00:21:04,001 --> 00:21:05,8
unpleasantries.

563
00:21:06,005 --> 00:21:07,5
Funny.

564
00:21:07,072 --> 00:21:10,3
That's not how this works.

565
00:21:10,052 --> 00:21:12,1
(guns cocking)
(chuckles)

566
00:21:12,027 --> 00:21:14,6
Oh, you men don't know
who you're dealing with.

567
00:21:14,085 --> 00:21:17,1
Those guns
don't frighten us.

568
00:21:17,036 --> 00:21:18,8
In fact,

569
00:21:19,007 --> 00:21:21,0
I dare you to shoot.

570
00:21:22,015 --> 00:21:22,6
Brother...

571
00:21:22,086 --> 00:21:23,9
Go ahead.

572
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,8
See what happens.

573
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:30,7
And there's that angelic ego
I was talking about.

574
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:40,5
I'm sorry, uh...
You were saying?

575
00:21:40,084 --> 00:21:42,8
Gentlemen, please...
(laughs)

576
00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:44,4
Don't mind my brother.

577
00:21:44,068 --> 00:21:46,0
He's just a bit... simple.

578
00:21:46,026 --> 00:21:48,9
We meant no disrespect, truly.

579
00:21:49,018 --> 00:21:50,8
- I thought you told me you
wanted your wings back.
- I do.

580
00:21:51,001 --> 00:21:53,1
But this is hardly
the way to go about it.

581
00:21:53,031 --> 00:21:54,6
Give me one good reason

582
00:21:54,081 --> 00:21:56,4
not to finish
this right now.

583
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:58,2
LUCIFER: Because
you misunderstood me.

584
00:21:58,048 --> 00:22:00,7
I'm more than happy
to buy the wings,

585
00:22:00,098 --> 00:22:03,6
like everyone else,
with cash.

586
00:22:03,082 --> 00:22:05,3
A whole
boatload of money.

587
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:07,0
If you truly worship the dollar,

588
00:22:07,028 --> 00:22:09,2
then I'm your ticket
to divinity.

589
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:16,8
Happy bidding.

590
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:18,0
(sighs)

591
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,3
Thank you.

ah, tell me again ♪

LUCIFER: It's funny, isn't it,
how all it takes

596
00:22:36,031 --> 00:22:38,0
to unite the faiths
of the world is a bit

597
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,8
of illegal consumerism.

598
00:22:40,006 --> 00:22:40,9
Mmm.

599
00:22:41,015 --> 00:22:42,2
What I'd like to know

600
00:22:42,048 --> 00:22:45,1
is since when
is the Prince of Darkness

601
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,7
scared of some
insufferable human gun?

602
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:49,7
Well, since I, uh...

603
00:22:49,091 --> 00:22:51,0
I bled.

604
00:22:51,024 --> 00:22:53,5
- What do you mean, bled?
- Yep.

605
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:56,2
Don't know how it's possible,
but on top of everything else,

606
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,5
seems I'm dealing
with a bit of a mortality sitch.

607
00:22:58,071 --> 00:23:00,5
Hence: ixnay on the unsgay.

608
00:23:01,067 --> 00:23:03,3
What are you
grinning about?

609
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:06,2
I'm just realizing the gravity
of what you're saying.

610
00:23:06,042 --> 00:23:08,0
That I'm allergic
to lead projectiles?

611
00:23:08,022 --> 00:23:09,6
That even if you
don't choose Hell,

612
00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:15,3
all I have do is wait for
some pitiful thug to end you

613
00:23:15,056 --> 00:23:18,7
and right back
to Hell you go.

614
00:23:20,069 --> 00:23:23,2
You hadn't put that one
together yet, had you, Lucy?

615
00:23:24,061 --> 00:23:26,5
You just made my millennium.

616
00:23:26,078 --> 00:23:28,7
(chuckles)

617
00:23:28,095 --> 00:23:30,9
CARMEN: Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

618
00:23:31,016 --> 00:23:32,5
I'm Carmen Grant

619
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:35,8
and I humbly welcome you
to our Evening of Faith.

620
00:23:36,008 --> 00:23:38,5
(applause)

621
00:23:38,075 --> 00:23:40,5
Tonight we shall behold items

622
00:23:40,071 --> 00:23:43,4
that prove
the miraculous is real.

623
00:23:43,063 --> 00:23:45,6
There is a power we can't see,

624
00:23:45,084 --> 00:23:48,2
but its light burns bright
in the priceless artifacts

625
00:23:48,047 --> 00:23:51,4
that have traveled
from around the world

626
00:23:51,068 --> 00:23:54,7
and, dare I say,
Heaven and Hell,

627
00:23:54,093 --> 00:23:56,7
to find their way to you!

628
00:23:56,093 --> 00:23:58,7
(applause)

629
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:04,2
Without further ado,

630
00:24:04,048 --> 00:24:07,6
I would like to introduce you
to the first item up for bid...

631
00:24:07,086 --> 00:24:10,7
the Lost Chains of St. Paul!

632
00:24:12,016 --> 00:24:13,9
According to tradition,

633
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,3
St. Paul was imprisoned

634
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:18,4
between 61 and 63 AD.

635
00:24:18,062 --> 00:24:22,1
While some pieces are on display
at the Papal Basilica--

636
00:24:22,033 --> 00:24:23,9
or so they say--

637
00:24:24,013 --> 00:24:26,7
these are the missing links.

638
00:24:26,096 --> 00:24:29,2
Paul's wrists were too thick
to fit in those chains.

639
00:24:29,046 --> 00:24:31,4
I know. That man never
could pass on dessert, could he?

640
00:24:31,068 --> 00:24:32,7
He should have been
the Saint of...

641
00:24:32,093 --> 00:24:34,0
Honey cakes?

642
00:24:34,022 --> 00:24:36,1
(laughing)

643
00:24:37,031 --> 00:24:39,4
Those are clearly fake!

644
00:24:39,064 --> 00:24:40,6
- What?
- Shh!

645
00:24:40,081 --> 00:24:41,6
Shh.

646
00:24:41,089 --> 00:24:44,2
Ooh. Tough crowd.

647
00:24:44,048 --> 00:24:47,1
You don't know
the half of it.

648
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,6
How did I know
you'd come here?

649
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:50,5
Because I'm admirably
consistent?

650
00:24:50,078 --> 00:24:52,1
How did you
even get in here?

651
00:24:52,036 --> 00:24:53,6
Oh, I've got news for you, pal.

652
00:24:53,086 --> 00:24:54,9
You're not the only one
with a little mojo.

653
00:24:55,016 --> 00:24:56,6
Mmm. Touché.

654
00:24:56,087 --> 00:24:57,6
And you're welcome, by the way.

655
00:24:57,087 --> 00:24:59,3
I came here to warn you.

656
00:24:59,058 --> 00:25:01,0
In about five minutes, the FBI's
gonna storm this place,

657
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,2
so we have to go now.

658
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:03,8
But we were just
getting started.

659
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:06,1
"We"?

660
00:25:06,033 --> 00:25:07,7
Oh, that's right.
You haven't met, have you?

661
00:25:07,092 --> 00:25:09,1
Allow me to introduce

662
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:10,5
Amenadiel.

663
00:25:10,071 --> 00:25:11,5
My brother.

664
00:25:11,072 --> 00:25:13,0
Well, come on,

665
00:25:13,026 --> 00:25:14,3
don't look so shocked.

666
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:15,8
Um...

667
00:25:16,001 --> 00:25:18,7
I just didn't

668
00:25:18,093 --> 00:25:20,6
expect your brother to be...

669
00:25:20,081 --> 00:25:23,3
so... handsome.

670
00:25:23,056 --> 00:25:25,1
AMENADIEL: We're all full
of surprises, it seems.

671
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,5
I never expected my brother
to change careers as he did.

672
00:25:28,073 --> 00:25:31,5
But I'm definitely beginning
to see why.

673
00:25:32,082 --> 00:25:34,6
Lucifer, your brother got

674
00:25:34,086 --> 00:25:36,0
all the charm in the family.

675
00:25:36,028 --> 00:25:37,6
Okay, that's
enough of that.

676
00:25:37,082 --> 00:25:38,9
It's unsettling to see
you two get along.

677
00:25:39,099 --> 00:25:41,1
CARMEN:
Next up.

678
00:25:43,033 --> 00:25:44,3
(crowd exclaiming, applauding)

679
00:25:44,058 --> 00:25:46,5
The wings of an angel.

680
00:25:54,042 --> 00:25:56,0
(whispers):
They're gorgeous.

681
00:25:59,014 --> 00:26:00,3
MAN:
Freeze! FBI!

682
00:26:00,051 --> 00:26:02,0
(crowd gasps)
MAN: What's going on?

683
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:03,1
Everyone, stay
where you are!

684
00:26:03,031 --> 00:26:04,3
Don't move!

685
00:26:07,069 --> 00:26:08,9
Stay where you are.

686
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,0
BODYGUARD:
Mr. Grant.

687
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,0
Nobody move.

688
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,1
Come on.

689
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,4
Stop! Freeze!

690
00:26:24,004 --> 00:26:25,4
Where'd he go?

691
00:26:26,092 --> 00:26:28,2
A little help.

692
00:26:29,063 --> 00:26:30,9
Please.

693
00:26:33,042 --> 00:26:34,6
(exhales)

694
00:26:39,093 --> 00:26:42,0
Thank you.

695
00:27:08,075 --> 00:27:10,9
They're fake.

696
00:27:18,043 --> 00:27:21,3
I'm telling you,
I saw him come in here.

697
00:27:21,064 --> 00:27:23,0
(indistinct radio transmission)

698
00:27:26,031 --> 00:27:28,7
(whispers):
There was a secret door.

699
00:27:30,094 --> 00:27:32,2
I see you got your wings.

700
00:27:32,044 --> 00:27:33,9
Thought you'd be happier.

701
00:27:34,015 --> 00:27:35,6
These aren't my wings.

702
00:27:35,082 --> 00:27:37,6
Whose wings are they?

703
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:39,7
Someone with
a warped sense of humor.

704
00:27:39,095 --> 00:27:41,0
- I don't...
- They're a knockoff,

705
00:27:41,024 --> 00:27:42,6
a sham.

706
00:27:42,087 --> 00:27:44,6
I mean, it's good work,
I'll give them that.

707
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:46,8
Probably would've fooled
just about anyone,

708
00:27:47,008 --> 00:27:49,2
save perhaps
the actual owner of the wings.

709
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:51,7
The actual owner-- being you?

710
00:27:51,092 --> 00:27:53,3
Yeah, they must've been
switched out.

711
00:27:53,054 --> 00:27:55,3
It's no coincidence that
my wings are stolen one day,

712
00:27:55,059 --> 00:27:58,9
and then Carmen's selling
an exact replica a week later.

713
00:27:59,013 --> 00:28:00,7
No, this is
some serious foul play.

714
00:28:00,093 --> 00:28:02,4
I-I'm sorry to hear that,
sincerely.

715
00:28:02,068 --> 00:28:03,7
But there's something
at Palmetto

716
00:28:03,097 --> 00:28:05,3
that I need to
take care of, so...

717
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,4
Are you coming?

718
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,9
Didn't you hear me?

719
00:28:10,014 --> 00:28:11,2
My wings are still out there.

720
00:28:11,048 --> 00:28:12,7
I need to find them.

721
00:28:12,094 --> 00:28:14,7
If you want to run off
to Palmetto, be my guest,

722
00:28:14,098 --> 00:28:17,1
but no more role-playing
for me, thanks.

723
00:28:17,036 --> 00:28:19,2
So I came to save your ass,
but just because these wings

724
00:28:19,049 --> 00:28:20,4
aren't the ones
you wanted,

725
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:22,0
that's it? We're done?

726
00:28:23,057 --> 00:28:26,1
So much for quid pro quo.

727
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,7
Ah.

728
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:31,2
You sure you don't want
to chase after her?

729
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:34,6
Maybe I can ask Father for some
rain and make it a moment.

730
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,4
All right.

731
00:28:41,068 --> 00:28:43,3
So what's our next move?

732
00:28:43,051 --> 00:28:46,1
Well, I'm afraid this is
where I leave you, brother.

733
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:47,4
What I'm about to do

734
00:28:47,068 --> 00:28:49,8
is the Devil's work.

735
00:28:56,086 --> 00:28:59,6
I thought we were finally
done with all this.

736
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:01,3
(sighs) I was done.

737
00:29:01,057 --> 00:29:03,6
I even started believing
I was crazy like everybody said.

738
00:29:03,086 --> 00:29:05,6
I never said
you were crazy.

739
00:29:05,087 --> 00:29:07,5
Yeah. It's okay.

740
00:29:07,074 --> 00:29:09,5
I would've thought I was, too.

741
00:29:09,074 --> 00:29:11,4
But, you know,
I got to thinking.

742
00:29:11,062 --> 00:29:13,5
Lucifer pointed out
that it made no sense

743
00:29:13,075 --> 00:29:15,4
for Aoudi to shoot
his inside man, right?

744
00:29:15,063 --> 00:29:17,0
Right.

745
00:29:18,017 --> 00:29:20,1
But no one else was there.

746
00:29:20,034 --> 00:29:23,3
No one could've shot Malcolm
and fled without me seeing them.

747
00:29:23,055 --> 00:29:24,3
- Now you're making my point.
- Because

748
00:29:24,051 --> 00:29:27,0
there was no obvious exit.

749
00:29:27,022 --> 00:29:28,1
But maybe,

750
00:29:28,035 --> 00:29:30,1
just maybe-- hear me out--

751
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:32,1
there was a secret one.

752
00:29:32,035 --> 00:29:35,0
Chloe, you are stabbing hard
at something

753
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,0
- that's just not there.
- There's got to be an explanation

754
00:29:37,023 --> 00:29:38,6
for what I saw, Dan!
There has to be.

755
00:29:38,086 --> 00:29:40,8
What do you need me to do?

756
00:29:41,007 --> 00:29:41,5
I don't...
(creaking)

757
00:29:44,086 --> 00:29:46,7
What was that?

758
00:29:46,091 --> 00:29:49,0
(creaking)

759
00:30:20,023 --> 00:30:21,8
Looks like it leads
up to the street.

760
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:26,9
Hey.

761
00:30:29,003 --> 00:30:30,9
What is it?

762
00:30:31,012 --> 00:30:32,7
A 999 key.

763
00:30:32,095 --> 00:30:34,4
LAPD-issued.

764
00:30:35,096 --> 00:30:37,7
Malcolm had his on him.

765
00:30:37,096 --> 00:30:40,5
- Wait. Are-are you saying...
- Yes.

766
00:30:40,075 --> 00:30:42,4
Another cop was here.

767
00:30:42,063 --> 00:30:44,2
- I was right.
- Chloe,

768
00:30:44,046 --> 00:30:45,3
- this could mean a lot
of things...
- It means

769
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:47,0
a cop knew

770
00:30:47,026 --> 00:30:49,5
this secret passageway existed,
Dan.

771
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,2
And chances are,

772
00:30:51,043 --> 00:30:52,8
whoever it was
shot Malcolm, so...

773
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:54,0
Yeah. But why?

774
00:30:54,022 --> 00:30:55,9
That's what I got to figure out.

775
00:30:56,014 --> 00:30:57,3
No.

776
00:30:58,077 --> 00:31:00,4
That's what we need
to figure out.

777
00:31:14,012 --> 00:31:16,0
(doorbell rings)

778
00:31:25,046 --> 00:31:27,3
It's...

779
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,5
you.

780
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,2
That's right, me,

781
00:31:30,047 --> 00:31:33,1
Lucifer bloody Morningstar.

782
00:31:33,035 --> 00:31:35,0
Do you mind
if I come in?

783
00:31:35,027 --> 00:31:36,8
You, Carmen,

784
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:38,6
slightly more difficult
to identify, aren't you?

785
00:31:38,089 --> 00:31:40,9
No phone, no bank account,

786
00:31:41,019 --> 00:31:43,3
home registered under
one of your many aliases.

787
00:31:43,052 --> 00:31:46,1
Seems wings aren't the
only thing you falsify, eh?

788
00:31:46,036 --> 00:31:48,1
- I can explain...
- I'm still moved by your words.

789
00:31:48,036 --> 00:31:51,1
"I'm a man that believes
in one simple divinity,

790
00:31:51,036 --> 00:31:53,7
- the almighty dollar."
- You don't understand...

791
00:31:53,091 --> 00:31:56,3
No, I understand. Perfectly.

792
00:31:56,058 --> 00:31:58,1
A lifelong atheist,

793
00:31:58,033 --> 00:32:00,3
you took one peek at the wings

794
00:32:00,058 --> 00:32:02,8
and something changed in you.

795
00:32:03,008 --> 00:32:04,8
The great white light
was revealed

796
00:32:05,009 --> 00:32:06,8
and a believer was born,

797
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:11,1
one who couldn't part
with real divinity!

798
00:32:17,077 --> 00:32:19,0
(exhales)

799
00:32:20,023 --> 00:32:22,5
Oh, no.

800
00:32:24,069 --> 00:32:26,8
Mounting my wings,

801
00:32:27,007 --> 00:32:30,0
like some decorative stag head.

802
00:32:32,082 --> 00:32:35,3
(sighs)

803
00:32:35,058 --> 00:32:37,3
Shame on you.

804
00:32:37,058 --> 00:32:40,3
It wasn't my fault.

805
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:42,3
Someone tipped me off.

806
00:32:42,058 --> 00:32:44,0
Excuses, excuses.

807
00:32:44,025 --> 00:32:46,0
"It wasn't me, it was
the biker that did it."

808
00:32:46,025 --> 00:32:48,0
I thought he was
bringing me a sculpture.

809
00:32:48,025 --> 00:32:49,3
Were you disappointed?

810
00:32:49,055 --> 00:32:50,8
I didn't know
what they were.

811
00:32:51,005 --> 00:32:53,1
I never would have done it
if I had any idea

812
00:32:53,034 --> 00:32:54,8
what I was actually
dealing with.

813
00:32:55,001 --> 00:32:57,2
Please, please.

814
00:32:57,043 --> 00:33:00,5
You can't take them away.

815
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:04,1
I can't live without them.

816
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,5
Perhaps you don't understand.

817
00:33:08,015 --> 00:33:10,6
(growling):
They're mine.

818
00:33:10,086 --> 00:33:14,2
Now, before I
deal with you,

819
00:33:14,045 --> 00:33:18,2
I have just one burning
question on my mind.

820
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:22,2
Who tipped you off?

821
00:33:37,043 --> 00:33:38,9
(chuckles dryly)

822
00:33:39,014 --> 00:33:40,6
I knew you'd come.

823
00:33:40,081 --> 00:33:42,0
Of course I'd come.

824
00:33:44,077 --> 00:33:47,2
It's my duty to return
the wings where they belong.

825
00:33:47,048 --> 00:33:49,2
Is that all?

826
00:33:49,048 --> 00:33:50,5
(chuckles)

827
00:33:54,007 --> 00:33:56,9
After everything
that you've been through--

828
00:33:57,012 --> 00:33:59,5
bleeding, searching, reaching
to the high heavens for help--

829
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:01,8
now that you finally
have your wings,

830
00:34:02,008 --> 00:34:04,7
doesn't part of you long
to assume your form?

831
00:34:06,087 --> 00:34:08,7
Get back to where you belong?

832
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,5
(sighs)

833
00:34:15,005 --> 00:34:16,9
Not exactly.

834
00:34:21,031 --> 00:34:23,4
What are you doing?!

835
00:34:23,068 --> 00:34:25,3
Well, ruining your plan,
it seems.

836
00:34:26,098 --> 00:34:28,4
It was you, brother.

837
00:34:28,069 --> 00:34:31,7
You tipped Carmen off,
and you orchestrated the theft.

838
00:34:31,098 --> 00:34:33,4
Because you left me no choice.

839
00:34:33,069 --> 00:34:34,8
(laughs)

840
00:34:35,003 --> 00:34:37,0
Well, clearly
you were desperate.

841
00:34:37,028 --> 00:34:39,3
I mean, you were willing
to let a human die

842
00:34:39,053 --> 00:34:41,6
and unleash the wings
upon the world

843
00:34:41,087 --> 00:34:43,6
just to remind me who I was.

844
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:46,2
(laughs) To fool me

845
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,2
into desiring the wings

846
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:49,9
and the hellish throne
they accompany.

847
00:34:50,017 --> 00:34:52,3
Well, do you know what?

848
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:55,8
It almost bloody worked.

849
00:34:56,005 --> 00:34:57,4
But destroy them?

850
00:34:59,034 --> 00:35:00,3
Why?

851
00:35:00,055 --> 00:35:02,6
Well, you were right.

852
00:35:02,089 --> 00:35:05,1
Severing the wings
was a half measure.

853
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:07,6
I did leave myself
an out.

854
00:35:07,085 --> 00:35:11,3
A rip cord back to the life
that dear old Dad chose for me.

855
00:35:11,052 --> 00:35:13,3
But I don't need it now,

856
00:35:13,052 --> 00:35:17,9
because, in case I haven't
made myself abundantly clear,

857
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:21,3
I'm never going back to Hell.

858
00:35:31,021 --> 00:35:32,3
But, uh...

859
00:35:32,059 --> 00:35:34,3
A for effort.

860
00:35:34,059 --> 00:35:38,7
I'm sure Dad will give you
a big gold star for trying.

861
00:35:38,093 --> 00:35:40,5
(bellowing)

862
00:35:46,056 --> 00:35:48,5
(laughing): That's right,
hit me, brother.

863
00:35:48,077 --> 00:35:49,8
Go on, again.

864
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:51,0
Become like me.

865
00:35:51,027 --> 00:35:52,0
Become wrath.

866
00:35:52,027 --> 00:35:53,5
Fall as I did!

867
00:35:53,077 --> 00:35:55,2
(laughs)

868
00:35:55,044 --> 00:35:56,5
Come on.

869
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:02,1
Come on.

870
00:36:02,037 --> 00:36:03,2
(chuckles)

871
00:36:06,008 --> 00:36:09,2
You never were much
of a closer, were you, eh?

872
00:36:09,046 --> 00:36:12,9
Can't stand to get
your hands dirty.

873
00:36:13,013 --> 00:36:13,9
(chuckles)

874
00:36:14,013 --> 00:36:16,2
This is far from over.

875
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:26,2
I'll do whatever it takes
to get you back to hell.

876
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,7
He was like a brother to me.

877
00:36:43,095 --> 00:36:45,4
And for the last eight years,

878
00:36:45,062 --> 00:36:47,9
he was the best damn partner

879
00:36:48,016 --> 00:36:50,2
that I could've asked for.

880
00:36:52,046 --> 00:36:53,7
(sighs)

881
00:36:57,075 --> 00:37:00,3
You know, I-I remember
one time that he...

882
00:37:01,097 --> 00:37:04,5
What in the hell...?

883
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:09,8
What part of "not welcome"
does she not understand?

884
00:37:10,002 --> 00:37:11,8
Easy, Anthony. Easy.

885
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:13,6
You got some nerve, Decker.

886
00:37:13,085 --> 00:37:16,0
(sighs)

887
00:37:16,027 --> 00:37:18,4
I'd like to say
a few things about Malcolm.

888
00:37:21,015 --> 00:37:23,3
He was a hero,

889
00:37:23,053 --> 00:37:26,6
who got shot doing
what all of us do every day,

890
00:37:26,087 --> 00:37:29,3
by putting himself
in the line of fire.

891
00:37:30,054 --> 00:37:31,5
I can't take back

892
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:33,6
the things I've said.

893
00:37:33,087 --> 00:37:36,5
But I can promise

894
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:38,5
not to let his life--

895
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,8
or death-- go in vain.

896
00:37:43,009 --> 00:37:46,9
And for any pain
that I've caused--

897
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:50,9
his family or otherwise--

898
00:37:51,014 --> 00:37:52,6
I'm sorry.

899
00:37:52,089 --> 00:37:55,7
I'm closing the case
against him.

900
00:37:58,086 --> 00:38:00,4
To a good cop.

901
00:38:03,069 --> 00:38:05,2
To Malcolm.

902
00:38:07,099 --> 00:38:09,8
To Malcolm.

903
00:38:10,003 --> 00:38:11,7
ALL:
To Malcolm.

904
00:38:25,022 --> 00:38:26,7
I hope you're right
about this.

905
00:38:26,093 --> 00:38:28,7
Trust me, if we're
gonna find a dirty cop,

906
00:38:28,093 --> 00:38:30,5
it's best they don't
think we're looking.

907
00:38:30,076 --> 00:38:34,0
(piano plays Johnny Cash's
version of "Hurt")

908
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:49,4
I cleaned up your mess
on the beach.

909
00:38:49,062 --> 00:38:51,8
I'm here to stay, Maze.

910
00:38:52,003 --> 00:38:53,4
(sighs)

911
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:55,8
And I truly hate
to disappoint you,

912
00:38:56,004 --> 00:38:59,9
but... well, this is
where I have to be now.

913
00:39:00,013 --> 00:39:04,5
And I know, even
with all the sex and drugs...

914
00:39:04,071 --> 00:39:06,7
and more sex,

915
00:39:06,097 --> 00:39:09,9
this isn't
what you bargained for.

916
00:39:10,018 --> 00:39:13,3
And I know
you made a vow, but...

917
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:15,4
But nothing.

918
00:39:17,018 --> 00:39:18,7
I am with you, Lucifer,

919
00:39:18,094 --> 00:39:20,8
from now until the end.

920
00:39:22,061 --> 00:39:25,4
We're a team, right?

921
00:39:28,003 --> 00:39:29,9
Of course.

922
00:39:37,046 --> 00:39:39,7
Now... (sighs)

923
00:39:39,096 --> 00:39:41,2
you should get some ice.

924
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:43,3
Yeah.

925
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:48,3
(sighs):
Hmm.

926
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:53,3
♪ 1:00 a.m. ♪

927
00:39:53,051 --> 00:39:58,2
♪ You're invited... ♪

928
00:39:59,048 --> 00:40:01,3
What happened?

929
00:40:01,052 --> 00:40:03,3
Hmm? Oh.

930
00:40:03,052 --> 00:40:05,4
(laughing):
Sorry. This, yes.

931
00:40:05,065 --> 00:40:07,8
Just a little, you know,
squabble with my bro.

932
00:40:08,003 --> 00:40:09,7
Nothing serious.

933
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:11,9
(sighs)

934
00:40:12,016 --> 00:40:13,9
I don't...

935
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:17,2
I don't like how we
left it at the auction.

936
00:40:17,041 --> 00:40:20,0
Yes. Yes, I...

937
00:40:20,029 --> 00:40:22,2
I agree.

938
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:24,8
You definitely could have
handled things better.

939
00:40:25,004 --> 00:40:26,1
(laughs)

940
00:40:26,034 --> 00:40:29,9
And I supposed,
you know, I...

941
00:40:30,017 --> 00:40:32,1
Sorry. What was I saying?
(laughs)

942
00:40:32,034 --> 00:40:35,8
(sighs)

943
00:40:36,001 --> 00:40:40,3
Look, I know how much
it sucks being alone.

944
00:40:40,056 --> 00:40:42,9
And I can't pretend
to understand

945
00:40:43,015 --> 00:40:45,1
why the wings meant
so much to you.

946
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,5
(sighs)

947
00:40:47,078 --> 00:40:49,6
But if we're really
friends, it...

948
00:40:49,086 --> 00:40:52,8
it should be enough just
knowing that they did.

949
00:40:56,049 --> 00:40:57,9
The wings are old news now.

950
00:40:58,012 --> 00:40:59,9
- (chuckles, clears his throat)
- What?

951
00:41:00,012 --> 00:41:01,9
Earlier they were all
you could think about.

952
00:41:02,016 --> 00:41:04,3
What...? Now you
just don't care?

953
00:41:04,058 --> 00:41:06,4
Well, in my search
for the wings,

954
00:41:06,067 --> 00:41:08,5
I realized what
they actually were.

955
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,2
A relic worth exactly

956
00:41:11,042 --> 00:41:13,8
what someone was willing
to pay for them.

957
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:16,4
What can I say?

958
00:41:16,068 --> 00:41:19,7
I've moved on to bigger
and better things.

959
00:41:19,097 --> 00:41:21,3
So, what changed?

960
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,1
I don't know.

961
00:41:23,031 --> 00:41:25,9
Huh.

962
00:41:26,015 --> 00:41:27,5
Or won't say.

963
00:41:27,077 --> 00:41:29,2
(laughs)

964
00:41:29,048 --> 00:41:31,7
Well, how'd your Palmetto thing
go anyway?

965
00:41:31,094 --> 00:41:34,3
Hmm? Did you find the answer
you were looking for?

966
00:41:34,057 --> 00:41:35,9
(sighs)

967
00:41:36,016 --> 00:41:37,3
I found something.

968
00:41:37,058 --> 00:41:40,2
Oh. Well.

969
00:41:40,045 --> 00:41:43,4

enigmatic futures.
