00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:38,1
That wack job's gonna
totally get me killed.

190
00:07:41,075 --> 00:07:43,6
♪♪

191
00:07:52,068 --> 00:07:54,1
CHLOE: What could you
have possibly said

192
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:55,6
to con your way
onto another case?

193
00:07:55,089 --> 00:07:57,5
Well, I simply offered
the lieutenant a favor.

194
00:07:57,072 --> 00:07:59,5
She gets what she wants,
and I get what I want--

195
00:07:59,073 --> 00:08:01,3
a nice juicy gang war.

196
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,5
You mean you offered to help
prevent a gang war, right?

197
00:08:03,073 --> 00:08:05,4
Tomato, tom-ah-to.

198
00:08:05,061 --> 00:08:06,6
But, see, that's why we
make such great partners.

199
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:07,7
The "he said, she said"
of it all.

200
00:08:07,098 --> 00:08:09,7
The yin-yang, the fireworks.

201
00:08:09,099 --> 00:08:10,7
Partners?

202
00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:12,5
More like glorified ride-along.

203
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:14,7
Just think, you and me,
close proximity at all times.

204
00:08:14,091 --> 00:08:16,2
Yeah, in L.A.,
we call that "stalking."

205
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,4
It's wonderful, isn't it?

206
00:08:17,066 --> 00:08:19,3
Uh, when do I get my own gun?

207
00:08:19,054 --> 00:08:20,9
I wouldn't trust you
with my kid's lightsaber.

208
00:08:21,016 --> 00:08:22,7
- And when do I get...
- I'll never let you drive.

209
00:08:22,096 --> 00:08:23,7
If I'm gonna be forced
to work with you again,

210
00:08:23,096 --> 00:08:24,7
I call the shots.

211
00:08:24,096 --> 00:08:26,0
You most certainly do.

212
00:08:26,025 --> 00:08:27,5
Right in the leg.
(chuckles)

213
00:08:27,075 --> 00:08:29,0
I only shot you
because you told me to.

214
00:08:29,026 --> 00:08:30,3
In a moment of weakness,

215
00:08:30,059 --> 00:08:32,3
I somehow fell for
your hocus-pocus

216
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:35,3
and believed that you
actually might be the Devil.

217
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,0
I am the Devil.

218
00:08:37,026 --> 00:08:39,0
Historically invincible,
until now,

219
00:08:39,027 --> 00:08:40,7
and that's what makes
this case so exciting--

220
00:08:40,093 --> 00:08:42,0
real danger.

221
00:08:42,027 --> 00:08:43,7
It's the perfect
opportunity to see

222
00:08:43,094 --> 00:08:45,7
what other mortal
qualities I have.

223
00:08:45,094 --> 00:08:46,7
(sighs)

224
00:08:48,052 --> 00:08:49,7
Okay, I get it-- you want
to feel new things.

225
00:08:49,098 --> 00:08:50,8
Exactly.

226
00:08:52,011 --> 00:08:53,4
- How's that?
- Bloody hell!

227
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,4
That hurt!

228
00:08:54,061 --> 00:08:56,0
Do it again.

229
00:08:56,028 --> 00:08:58,0
(elevator bell dings,
Lucifer chuckles)

230
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,3
So where to, eh?

231
00:08:59,058 --> 00:09:01,0
Stakeout, ambush?

232
00:09:01,025 --> 00:09:02,4
You know, I'm quite
skilled at restraints.

233
00:09:02,062 --> 00:09:03,5
No, I'm taking you home.

234
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:05,2
Ooh, how did you know?

235
00:09:05,042 --> 00:09:06,8
That I'd last about
ten minutes with you?

236
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,1
I don't know,
call it a gut feeling.

237
00:09:08,034 --> 00:09:09,2
Well, it's a
successful one.

238
00:09:09,046 --> 00:09:10,2
We'll be right on time.

239
00:09:10,046 --> 00:09:11,4
Time? For what?

240
00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:14,0
Lucifer, my man!

241
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,2
LUCIFER:
Benny!

242
00:09:15,043 --> 00:09:16,7
Nice to see you.

243
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,3
So you're friends
with Benny Choi

244
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,2
and his blinged-out
pet pig.

245
00:09:20,047 --> 00:09:21,4
- Of course you are.
- Mm-hmm.

246
00:09:21,068 --> 00:09:22,6
His name is
Pig Diddy.

247
00:09:22,085 --> 00:09:24,7
This is my
assistant Hector.

248
00:09:24,098 --> 00:09:25,7
LUCIFER:
Ooh.

249
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:27,1
Someone love his mommy?

250
00:09:28,056 --> 00:09:29,6
Ex-Marine, bitch.

251
00:09:29,082 --> 00:09:30,6
Right.

252
00:09:30,082 --> 00:09:31,9
Yes, Benny and I go back

253
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:33,5
to the start of his very
impressive career.

254
00:09:33,078 --> 00:09:35,6
Huh, let me guess,
you did him a favor.

255
00:09:35,086 --> 00:09:37,2
Lucifer helped me
get my first show.

256
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:38,9
He was a real
inspiration.

257
00:09:39,016 --> 00:09:40,9
I try to reflect that in my art.

258
00:09:41,016 --> 00:09:42,6
Any idea who took
a shot at you?

259
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,4
Nope.

260
00:09:44,062 --> 00:09:45,9
No recent
threats, nothing?

261
00:09:46,017 --> 00:09:48,8
Look, I'm no snitch.

262
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:50,5
Even if I did know,
I can't talk.

263
00:09:50,075 --> 00:09:51,8
I'm an artist.

264
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:53,9
I process tragedy
through my work.

265
00:09:54,017 --> 00:09:56,4
CHLOE:
Would you prefer to process
tragedy back at the precinct?

266
00:09:56,059 --> 00:09:58,0
'Cause I have a holding cell

267
00:09:58,022 --> 00:09:59,3
that could really use
an artist's touch.

268
00:09:59,055 --> 00:10:00,7
Yes, Benny,
that favor you owe me,

269
00:10:00,097 --> 00:10:03,1
I'm calling in my IOU.

270
00:10:03,027 --> 00:10:05,8
Answer the detective's
questions.

271
00:10:07,098 --> 00:10:09,4
Hector clashed with some punks

272
00:10:09,069 --> 00:10:11,1
in Latin Kings colors
that night.

273
00:10:11,036 --> 00:10:13,1
We were at capacity,
they wanted in.

274
00:10:13,036 --> 00:10:15,2
They were making threats,
they were upset.

275
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:20,6
And you didn't mention this
at the crime scene because...?

276
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:22,0
BENNY: My fans aren't
just buying shoes.

277
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:24,0
They're buying Benny Choi.

278
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:26,7
Artist, activist,
man of the people.

279
00:10:26,096 --> 00:10:28,2
You know, I wore colors
back in the day.

280
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,7
Asian Boyz.
I was low level.

281
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:31,2
You know, a punk.

282
00:10:31,046 --> 00:10:33,4
Got out before the cops
even knew my name.

283
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:34,4
Ah, protecting your rep.

284
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:35,9
Wouldn't want to risk

285
00:10:36,013 --> 00:10:37,6
that seven-figure
endorsement deal, would we?

286
00:10:37,084 --> 00:10:39,3
I didn't talk because
if a Latin King hears

287
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:41,3
an ex-Asian Boy done
dry-snitched him to the cops?

288
00:10:41,055 --> 00:10:44,6
Those thugs will
retaliate on principal.

289
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:46,6
I was trying
to prevent more death.

290
00:10:46,085 --> 00:10:48,1
Well, aren't we
the little saint?

291
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:49,8
CHLOE: Latin Kings
versus Asian Boyz.

292
00:10:50,006 --> 00:10:51,0
That really
narrows it down.

293
00:10:51,023 --> 00:10:52,2
Did you get names?

294
00:10:56,032 --> 00:10:57,7
Diego, Dani, I don't know.

295
00:10:57,099 --> 00:10:58,8
A couple, I think.

296
00:10:59,003 --> 00:11:00,2
Joined at the hip.

297
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,4
Mm-hmm.

298
00:11:01,066 --> 00:11:03,5
Diego and Dani. Right.

299
00:11:03,074 --> 00:11:06,2
You need to call me if you
remember anything else.

300
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:11,2
Uh, yeah, I'll call.

301
00:11:11,042 --> 00:11:12,5
But be careful.

302
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:14,4
Them Latin Kings
about to raise hell.

303
00:11:14,063 --> 00:11:15,9
My "speciality."

304
00:11:16,017 --> 00:11:17,1
(chuckles)

305
00:11:17,034 --> 00:11:18,8
(snorting)

306
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:20,2
CHLOE:
Did it ever occur to you

307
00:11:20,043 --> 00:11:21,8
to tell me that
you're tight with Benny?

308
00:11:22,009 --> 00:11:23,8
That you gave one of your
favors to a former gang felon?

309
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,9
Well, I've been giving
favors for thousands of years.

310
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,4
Would you like
a peek at my ledger?

311
00:11:27,068 --> 00:11:29,1
No, I'd like you to
follow basic protocol.

312
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:30,5
And I'd love
to continue the debate

313
00:11:30,077 --> 00:11:31,8
on our opposing views
of police work,

314
00:11:32,002 --> 00:11:33,4
so how about we hit
the cop bar,

315
00:11:33,065 --> 00:11:35,2
and get dangerous with
some bottom shelf, huh?

316
00:11:35,048 --> 00:11:36,9
A girl's dead and you want
to go on a pub crawl.

317
00:11:37,011 --> 00:11:37,9
Oh, liquid courage.

318
00:11:38,011 --> 00:11:39,3
I hear the Paddock Lounge

319
00:11:39,057 --> 00:11:40,7
is every new detective's
rite of passage.

320
00:11:40,095 --> 00:11:42,2
Forget it.

321
00:11:42,049 --> 00:11:43,6
We need to wait for
an I.D. on those kids.

322
00:11:43,087 --> 00:11:46,2
150,000 active gang
members in L.A.,

323
00:11:46,045 --> 00:11:47,9
it could take awhile.

324
00:11:48,012 --> 00:11:49,3
Oh, you're right.
No time for a quick drink, then.

325
00:11:49,054 --> 00:11:51,3
We're on duty.

326
00:11:51,058 --> 00:11:53,5
You are the oldest young
person I've ever met!

327
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:56,4
And coming from an immortal,
that's saying something.

328
00:11:58,055 --> 00:12:00,9
Look, I'm not gonna drink at
a bar where everyone hates me.

329
00:12:01,018 --> 00:12:03,9
Did you ever consider they
hate you for that very reason?

330
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:06,3
Yeah, they hate me for
several reasons.

331
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,9
Well, don't let those
Philistines inhibit your right

332
00:12:09,014 --> 00:12:11,2
to toast our first break
in the case-- come on!

333
00:12:11,044 --> 00:12:12,6
It's the least you could do.

334
00:12:12,081 --> 00:12:14,3
- (sighs)
- Besides, you know, I...

335
00:12:14,052 --> 00:12:15,6
need something
to dull the pain.

336
00:12:16,077 --> 00:12:17,7
Ugh! If I say yes,

337
00:12:17,098 --> 00:12:19,1
will you shut up
about the leg?

338
00:12:19,032 --> 00:12:20,6
No promises.

339
00:12:20,086 --> 00:12:24,2
Ooh! Aah! (muttering)

340
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,6

MAN: Here comes

Want me to lose this guy?

(rock music playing
in background)

348
00:12:40,097 --> 00:12:42,0
It's Italian wool.

349
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,4
Touch it.
I know you want to.

350
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,0
Go on.

351
00:12:47,097 --> 00:12:49,7
Yeah. That'll do.

352
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:52,6
(clears throat)
Well, somebody's not

353
00:12:52,081 --> 00:12:54,3
being crowned homecoming
queen, are they?

354
00:12:54,052 --> 00:12:56,1
Yeah. Order. Please.

355
00:12:56,036 --> 00:12:57,6
Right.

356
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:59,6
Uh, two shots of your
finest swill, please, love.

357
00:12:59,086 --> 00:13:01,4
WOMAN: You got it.
I'll have a water.

358
00:13:03,086 --> 00:13:05,1
So, about this whole
favor thing.

359
00:13:05,032 --> 00:13:07,2
What... what is it?

360
00:13:07,045 --> 00:13:09,2
What are you, some kind
of loan shark?

361
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,0
Con man? Godfather
with a twist?

362
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:14,0
But surely you've
heard the expression...

363
00:13:14,021 --> 00:13:15,6
"Deal with the Devil"?

364
00:13:15,088 --> 00:13:17,4
Mm!
Come on, give me a break.

365
00:13:17,067 --> 00:13:19,0
No, people come to me
to ask for favors,

366
00:13:19,025 --> 00:13:20,9
and more often than not,
I'm happy to oblige.

367
00:13:21,017 --> 00:13:22,3
What do you get?

368
00:13:22,055 --> 00:13:24,1
Well, sometimes,
I have something in mind,

369
00:13:24,038 --> 00:13:25,6
but, usually,
like with Benny,

370
00:13:25,084 --> 00:13:28,0
it's simply to be
repaid at a later date.

371
00:13:28,022 --> 00:13:30,1
A devilish IOU,
if you will.

372
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:31,8
Who would take
a deal like that?

373
00:13:33,018 --> 00:13:34,5
They all do.

374
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,5
Palmetto Bitch.

375
00:13:42,003 --> 00:13:44,7
Ooh! Juicy! Do tell.

376
00:13:45,086 --> 00:13:47,2
(sighs heavily)

377
00:13:47,049 --> 00:13:49,2
That's Anthony Paolucci.

378
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,8
He's partners with the guy

379
00:13:51,004 --> 00:13:52,2
who took a bullet
in the Palmetto case--

380
00:13:52,045 --> 00:13:53,5
Malcolm Graham.

381
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:55,5
Ah, yes, the infamous Palmetto.

382
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:58,2
Malcolm got shot
meeting with some gangsters,

383
00:13:58,042 --> 00:14:01,0
and... Paolucci thinks
he took the bullet

384
00:14:01,025 --> 00:14:03,0
like a hero;
I think he was on the take.

385
00:14:04,022 --> 00:14:06,3
Aha! So you're a snitch.

386
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:08,9
A narc. No wonder
nobody likes you.

387
00:14:09,018 --> 00:14:10,9
Yeah, you'd think I was
guilty of a crime.

388
00:14:11,014 --> 00:14:12,6
Yeah, you know what they say:
"Snitches end up in ditches."

389
00:14:12,081 --> 00:14:14,2
Oh, thanks, man.

390
00:14:14,043 --> 00:14:15,8
I feel so much better.

391
00:14:16,006 --> 00:14:17,0
Hm!

392
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,4
No, I don't know, I just...

393
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,2
was following
my gut, I guess.

394
00:14:20,044 --> 00:14:22,4
Caught in the crosshairs
of another man's crime.

395
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,0
I don't need your sympathy,
but thank you.

396
00:14:24,028 --> 00:14:25,5
Fair enough.

397
00:14:25,074 --> 00:14:27,4
Still, no excuse
for that man's rudeness.

398
00:14:27,061 --> 00:14:28,9
No, no, no, no--
I can handle Paolucci.

399
00:14:29,016 --> 00:14:30,3
I don't need you
to stand up for me.

400
00:14:30,057 --> 00:14:31,7
Understood.

401
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,4
Excuse me.

402
00:14:35,062 --> 00:14:37,0
Hello.

403
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:38,5
- What do you want?
- Well, firstly,

404
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,2
let me state that I'm in no way

405
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,0
standing up for my associate,
Detective Decker.

406
00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:44,7
But on behalf of myself,
and only myself,

407
00:14:44,096 --> 00:14:46,9
I think you're
a complete sack of ass.

408
00:14:47,013 --> 00:14:48,4
(grunts,
men murmuring)

409
00:14:49,093 --> 00:14:52,0
Are you crazy?
Let's get out of here.

410
00:14:56,077 --> 00:14:59,6
♪♪

411
00:14:59,081 --> 00:15:00,7
And your name?

412
00:15:00,098 --> 00:15:02,4
Mazikeen.

413
00:15:02,065 --> 00:15:04,7
How do you spell that?

414
00:15:04,098 --> 00:15:06,8
Surprise me.

415
00:15:09,078 --> 00:15:11,6
Interesting choice
of venue.

416
00:15:11,082 --> 00:15:14,2
What, are you trying to
throw me off-balance?

417
00:15:14,049 --> 00:15:15,6
Because I'm much more
comfortable among humans

418
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,9
than you might think.

419
00:15:18,033 --> 00:15:19,3
So I see.

420
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,5
This is my favorite
place in the city.

421
00:15:26,071 --> 00:15:27,6
Really?

422
00:15:27,088 --> 00:15:29,4
Look at them on their laptops,

423
00:15:29,068 --> 00:15:31,4
writing the next great
screenplay,

424
00:15:31,068 --> 00:15:33,9
torturing themselves
with dreams they know,

425
00:15:34,018 --> 00:15:37,3
deep down,
they will never achieve.

426
00:15:38,043 --> 00:15:40,2
Reminds me of home.

427
00:15:40,048 --> 00:15:41,3
Get to the point.

428
00:15:43,052 --> 00:15:44,8
I want to go back.

429
00:15:46,036 --> 00:15:48,4
Then give me something, Maze.

430
00:15:48,061 --> 00:15:50,4
Give me something that I
can use against Lucifer,

431
00:15:50,065 --> 00:15:52,3
and I'll make sure you're
both back where you belong.

432
00:15:52,053 --> 00:15:53,8
That's the problem.

433
00:15:54,007 --> 00:15:54,9
He doesn't confide
in me anymore.

434
00:15:56,058 --> 00:15:57,9
But...

435
00:15:58,012 --> 00:16:00,7
there is someone
he does talk to-- a doctor.

436
00:16:02,042 --> 00:16:04,6
And I bet she would love
that ridiculous suit.

437
00:16:06,042 --> 00:16:09,0
And here I thought you were
the loyal soldier.

438
00:16:09,026 --> 00:16:10,8
I want what's best for Lucifer.

439
00:16:12,001 --> 00:16:13,3
Same thing you want.

440
00:16:14,093 --> 00:16:16,4
Then tell me about
this doctor...

441
00:16:19,002 --> 00:16:20,3
..."Mike."

442
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,0
(distant siren wailing)

443
00:16:32,086 --> 00:16:34,6
(wings whoosh, flap
in distance)

444
00:16:36,087 --> 00:16:38,0
Hello?

445
00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:40,6
Is anybody there?

446
00:16:47,042 --> 00:16:48,8
I know Krav Maga!

447
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,1
(wings whoosh, flap)

448
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:03,8
(palm fronds rustling)

449
00:17:05,044 --> 00:17:06,9
(gasps)

450
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:08,4
(sighs anxiously)

451
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,8
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to startle you.

452
00:17:10,007 --> 00:17:11,3
How did you get in here?

453
00:17:11,053 --> 00:17:12,9
I have a key.

454
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:17,0
Yeah, let me start over.

455
00:17:17,028 --> 00:17:19,4
Uh, I actually just moved
into the office next-door.

456
00:17:21,004 --> 00:17:21,9
I'm Dr. Canaan.

457
00:17:22,016 --> 00:17:22,9
(laughing):
Oh, okay.

458
00:17:23,016 --> 00:17:25,2
Hi. Uh, I'm Linda.

459
00:17:25,037 --> 00:17:26,6
Uh, Dr. Martin.

460
00:17:28,046 --> 00:17:29,3
(chuckles)

461
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,5
(dance music playing)

462
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,8
It's fantastic, actually.

463
00:17:37,001 --> 00:17:38,6
The thrill of fighting humans

464
00:17:38,089 --> 00:17:40,6
has taken on a whole new spin,
now that I might get hurt.

465
00:17:40,085 --> 00:17:42,1
Although, sadly,
the only thing broken

466
00:17:42,035 --> 00:17:44,0
was that incontinent
troll's nose.

467
00:17:44,023 --> 00:17:46,2
Your behavior is foolish.

468
00:17:46,048 --> 00:17:47,6
Oh, come on!

469
00:17:47,086 --> 00:17:49,5
You used to love danger.

470
00:17:49,077 --> 00:17:52,5
Since when did Hell's favorite
torturer become my mother?

471
00:17:52,074 --> 00:17:54,3
You're changing.

472
00:17:54,057 --> 00:17:55,6
Becoming vulnerable.

473
00:17:55,086 --> 00:17:58,2
Maybe even...
(whispers): mortal.

474
00:17:58,049 --> 00:17:59,6
Mm!

475
00:18:01,062 --> 00:18:04,7
If I'm not going to look out
for you, who will? Hmm?

476
00:18:04,091 --> 00:18:05,9
Your pet cop?

477
00:18:06,017 --> 00:18:07,0
That's what partners are for.

478
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:08,6
She is not your partner.

479
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:10,9
Have you two been talking?

480
00:18:12,084 --> 00:18:15,5
(chuckles)

481
00:18:15,076 --> 00:18:17,8
You know, I actually don't
think it's my mortality

482
00:18:18,005 --> 00:18:18,8
that you're worried about.

483
00:18:19,005 --> 00:18:20,6
You're just jealous

484
00:18:20,089 --> 00:18:23,1
that I'm exploring it
with Detective Decker.

485
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:24,1
(sets bottle down)

486
00:18:26,081 --> 00:18:28,0
Jealous of a mortal woman?

487
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,5
Mm-hmm.

488
00:18:29,073 --> 00:18:30,5
(scoffing laugh)

489
00:18:30,073 --> 00:18:32,2
I don't think so.

490
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:34,5
But if you insist on
continuing this exploration,

491
00:18:34,074 --> 00:18:36,8
maybe next time, I won't be
around to save your ass.

492
00:18:37,003 --> 00:18:38,8
Mm! Well, that is a shame.

493
00:18:39,003 --> 00:18:40,3
'Cause you and my backside
used to get on very well.

494
00:18:40,057 --> 00:18:42,2
My front side,
as well, actually.

495
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:43,9
Things change, Lucifer.

496
00:18:44,012 --> 00:18:45,8
Yes, but you don't, Maze.

497
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:49,2
You exist to protect me.

498
00:18:49,042 --> 00:18:52,6
To know where I am
and who I'm with at all times,

499
00:18:52,088 --> 00:18:54,0
whether you
want to, or not.

500
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,3
Pretty sure your name's
not on the list.

501
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,6
It should be.

502
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:11,5
Considering I've just spent
the last couple of hours

503
00:19:11,077 --> 00:19:14,3
convincing Anthony Paolucci
not to press charges.

504
00:19:14,057 --> 00:19:15,7
(wry laugh)

505
00:19:15,094 --> 00:19:17,0
Well, what if I want
to press charges?

506
00:19:17,028 --> 00:19:18,7
- For what?
- Stupidity.

507
00:19:18,099 --> 00:19:21,6
A drunk, on-duty cop--
surely that's a no-no.

508
00:19:21,087 --> 00:19:23,3
But don't worry,
I'm feeling charitable.

509
00:19:23,053 --> 00:19:24,7
I'll let it slide this time.

510
00:19:26,058 --> 00:19:27,7
(sultry purr)

511
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,2
Is it my thanks
you want, or a kiss?

512
00:19:29,046 --> 00:19:31,1
I don't want your thanks.

513
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:33,4
Because I don't do favors
for guys like you.

514
00:19:33,063 --> 00:19:35,0
I did this for Chloe.

515
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:38,4
Oh, stop raining on the
poor woman's parade.

516
00:19:38,063 --> 00:19:41,2
It's about time she got
some spark in her life.

517
00:19:42,051 --> 00:19:43,5
Spark?

518
00:19:43,076 --> 00:19:46,2
How about real danger?

519
00:19:46,043 --> 00:19:47,9
Do you have any idea how easy

520
00:19:48,014 --> 00:19:49,6
a gang vendetta can spiral
out of control?

521
00:19:49,081 --> 00:19:51,2
Well, I'm trying
my best to find out.

522
00:19:51,048 --> 00:19:52,5
Yeah.

523
00:19:52,077 --> 00:19:54,1
That's exactly
why I'm here.

524
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:57,9
Chloe is the mother
of my child, you imbecile.

525
00:19:59,019 --> 00:20:00,3
You want to work this case?

526
00:20:01,078 --> 00:20:02,6
Take care of her.

527
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:05,6
Sir, yes, sir.

528
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:17,8
(man rapping in Spanish)

529
00:20:18,001 --> 00:20:19,7
CHLOE:
Okay, Latin Kings turf.

530
00:20:19,097 --> 00:20:21,0
You need to have
my back on this.

531
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,6
LUCIFER:
You can count on me, Detective.

532
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:25,6
All right,
Dani and Diego Ramirez.

533
00:20:25,085 --> 00:20:28,1
Married straight out of juvie;
real hotheads.

534
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:29,3
Ooh! Do we get
to kick in the door?

535
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,9
As your
self-sacrificing partner,

536
00:20:31,014 --> 00:20:32,4
I volunteer to go first.

537
00:20:32,069 --> 00:20:33,9
No, there'll be
no kicking in of anything,

538
00:20:34,015 --> 00:20:35,1
unless we have a warrant,

539
00:20:35,036 --> 00:20:36,6
or people are in
immediate danger.

540
00:20:38,023 --> 00:20:39,4
You better start taking
this case seriously.

541
00:20:39,069 --> 00:20:41,0
If this escalates
to a gang war...

542
00:20:41,028 --> 00:20:43,2
Yes, yes, it could spiral
out of control--

543
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:45,1
blood could run in the streets,
fire could rain down.

544
00:20:45,037 --> 00:20:46,5
You sound just like your ex.

545
00:20:48,008 --> 00:20:49,3
What do you mean--
you spoke to Dan?

546
00:20:49,058 --> 00:20:50,5
Mm!

547
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:51,8
He dropped by Lux.

548
00:20:52,004 --> 00:20:54,1
Kept rambling on
about keeping you safe.

549
00:20:54,033 --> 00:20:55,5
Quite condescending,
if you ask me.

550
00:20:55,075 --> 00:20:58,3
What is it with
the men in my life?

551
00:20:58,055 --> 00:20:59,8
I'm a man in your life?

552
00:21:01,042 --> 00:21:02,3
(Lucifer chuckles)

553
00:21:02,051 --> 00:21:03,3
(alarm chirps twice)

554
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,2
(rattling door handle)

555
00:21:07,047 --> 00:21:09,8
Uh, Detective, you seem to have
left on the central locking!

556
00:21:10,006 --> 00:21:11,8
Act like a child,
get treated like a child.

557
00:21:12,006 --> 00:21:13,2
Wha...? Isn't it illegal

Diego and Dani Ramirez, LAPD.

562
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,5
Need to ask you
a few questions.

563
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:33,5
(rock continues playing)

564
00:21:36,025 --> 00:21:37,7
LAPD! Open up!

565
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:39,4
Come on, baby.

566
00:21:39,067 --> 00:21:41,4
Let me make you
feel better.

567

DANI:
Who the hell are you?!

DIEGO:
What are you doing here?!

571
00:21:57,027 --> 00:21:58,7
What are you doing
in my house, man?!

572
00:22:01,032 --> 00:22:02,7
How the hell did you
get out of the car?

573
00:22:02,099 --> 00:22:04,7
Child's play,
and good thing I did.

574
00:22:04,095 --> 00:22:06,3
There was immediate danger.

575
00:22:06,053 --> 00:22:08,8
He was about to leave this woman
completely unsatisfied.

576
00:22:09,007 --> 00:22:10,4
What the--?!
CHLOE: Hey! Hey!

577
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:12,0
- Down.
- He's your partner?

578
00:22:12,029 --> 00:22:13,5
Yeah, don't get me started.

579
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:15,9
DANI: Cops harass us
no matter what we do!

580
00:22:16,012 --> 00:22:17,5
And now they're breaking
into our house?!

581
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:19,0
I should sue that pervert!

582
00:22:19,025 --> 00:22:20,4
You have my blessing.

583
00:22:20,063 --> 00:22:21,7
But first,
let's talk Benny Choi.

584
00:22:21,096 --> 00:22:23,0
Yes, did you
attempt to use him

585
00:22:23,021 --> 00:22:24,8
as target practice
the other night?

586
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:26,5
- That wasn't us!
- No.

587
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,9
Okay, well, witnesses said

588
00:22:28,018 --> 00:22:29,2
they heard you
making threats at the door.

589
00:22:29,043 --> 00:22:30,6
DIEGO: No, we-we
just wanted in.

590
00:22:30,085 --> 00:22:32,3
We wanted a pair
of Benny's sweet kicks.

591
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,0
Enough to pay for them
with Paola Cortez's blood?

592
00:22:34,022 --> 00:22:36,0
Paola was Diego's
cousin, okay?

593
00:22:36,027 --> 00:22:37,3
It's wack what happened to her.

594
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,4
Why do you think he's so upset?

595
00:22:42,007 --> 00:22:43,6
I promised I'd
get her in the show.

596
00:22:43,086 --> 00:22:45,5
There wasn't
enough room for three,

597
00:22:45,078 --> 00:22:48,1
so... we gave her our spot.

598
00:22:49,095 --> 00:22:51,4
She wanted to be a designer.

599
00:22:51,066 --> 00:22:53,6
Sorry, is that,
is that flop sweat

600
00:22:53,087 --> 00:22:54,9
or is that a tear?

601
00:22:55,016 --> 00:22:56,9
That's... Oh...

602
00:22:57,012 --> 00:22:58,3
Oh, bloody hell.

603
00:22:58,058 --> 00:22:59,7
This is our bad guy?

604
00:22:59,096 --> 00:23:01,2
No wonder he can't get it up.

605
00:23:03,009 --> 00:23:04,8
Look, uh...

606
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:06,5
if you didn't
take a shot at Benny,

607
00:23:06,072 --> 00:23:08,8
then help us get
justice for Paola.

608
00:23:10,076 --> 00:23:12,0
Tell us what you know,
all right?

609
00:23:16,068 --> 00:23:17,9
If anyone had beef
with Benny Choi,

610
00:23:18,019 --> 00:23:18,9
it's Yellow Viper.

611
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:20,8
LUCIFER:
"Yellow Viper"?

612
00:23:21,002 --> 00:23:22,7
(laughs)
Sounds like a venereal disease.

613
00:23:22,098 --> 00:23:25,0
DANI: He got out of jail a few
nights before Benny's show.

614
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,4
He was a big-deal
graffiti artist,

615
00:23:26,069 --> 00:23:27,8
ran with Benny
back in the day,

616
00:23:28,003 --> 00:23:29,1
then took the fall
on some B&E.

617
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:31,1
He got five and change,

618
00:23:31,032 --> 00:23:33,0
while Benny got
rich and famous.

619
00:23:33,024 --> 00:23:34,5
Well, it does sound like
this Viper fellow

620
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,1
has every reason
to punish Benny.

621
00:23:36,033 --> 00:23:38,0
We need to present
a unified front.

622
00:23:38,029 --> 00:23:39,6
Speculate later,
not in front of them.

623
00:23:39,087 --> 00:23:41,2
Got it.

624
00:23:41,046 --> 00:23:43,1
So, Viper's beef
killed your cousin then, eh?

625
00:23:44,063 --> 00:23:46,0
What?
That wasn't speculation.

626
00:23:46,021 --> 00:23:47,6
That was a statement
of potential fact.

627
00:23:47,084 --> 00:23:49,1
And if we ever run into him,

628
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:51,0
he won't have to worry
about no cops.

629
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,3
LUCIFER: So you're just gonna
sit around and wait for revenge?

630
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,7
That's rather lazy.

631
00:23:53,093 --> 00:23:55,0
Okay, this is

All right, tough.

635
00:24:00,006 --> 00:24:01,1
Right now,
we need to warn Benny

636
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,6
that his buddy Viper's
back in town.

637
00:24:02,085 --> 00:24:04,6

No, from Benny.

LUCIFER: Were you aware that
your old friend Yellow Viper

665
00:25:15,018 --> 00:25:17,4
was released
from prison last week?

666
00:25:17,064 --> 00:25:19,1
No, I had no idea he was out.

667
00:25:19,031 --> 00:25:21,5
No phone calls?
No contact?

668
00:25:21,077 --> 00:25:23,7
I sent him letters
when he was inside San Quentin.

669

Money for lawyers, too.

670

Viper went down.

He was my best friend--

Well, with friends like that,
I'd hide the knives.

Well, if Viper hadn't
have gone to prison,

he wouldn't have targeted
Benny and shot up his show,

727

00:28:05,051 --> 00:28:07,2
Hmm.

745
00:28:07,047 --> 00:28:09,3
Yellow Viper,
I presume.

746
00:28:09,056 --> 00:28:12,2
He's teaching art
to youngsters.

747
00:28:12,044 --> 00:28:14,3
I mean, this bad guy thing's
gonna be all the joke now.

748
00:28:14,056 --> 00:28:15,7
What next--
cuddles and ice cream?

749
00:28:15,098 --> 00:28:18,2
(Yellow Viper continues,
low and indistinct)

750
00:28:26,045 --> 00:28:28,0
Private class.

751
00:28:28,029 --> 00:28:30,0
I'm Detective Decker.

752
00:28:30,029 --> 00:28:31,4
This is... Never mind.

753
00:28:31,062 --> 00:28:33,1
I need to ask you
a few questions

754
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:34,6
about the shooting
at Benny's fashion show.

755
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:36,0
You got a warrant?

756
00:28:36,029 --> 00:28:37,8
If not...

757
00:28:38,005 --> 00:28:39,3
beat it.

758
00:28:39,055 --> 00:28:41,0
I'm not talking to cops.

759
00:28:41,022 --> 00:28:42,9
Ooh, do you have something
to hide, Mr. Viper?

760
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:44,5
Or do you go by Yellow?

761
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,4
Oh, you think I'm gonna
let you bust my balls

762
00:28:46,068 --> 00:28:47,8
in front of these kids?

763
00:28:48,001 --> 00:28:49,8
Arrest me

764
00:28:50,002 --> 00:28:51,9
or step off.

765
00:28:55,002 --> 00:28:56,9
Ooh, charming.

766
00:28:57,011 --> 00:28:58,5
- YOUNG MAN: Is everything okay?
- Well, he's right.

767
00:28:58,073 --> 00:29:00,1
He doesn't have
to talk to us.

768
00:29:00,036 --> 00:29:02,4
He really seems to care
about those kids.

769
00:29:02,065 --> 00:29:03,8
It's odd for a criminal.

770
00:29:04,003 --> 00:29:05,2
Or anyone, really.

771
00:29:05,049 --> 00:29:06,9
You know,
if you spent as much time

772
00:29:07,016 --> 00:29:08,8
appealing to suspects
as you do annoying me,

773
00:29:09,004 --> 00:29:10,9
(cars approaching)
things might go...

774
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:12,6
go a lot faster.

775
00:29:12,087 --> 00:29:14,9
(tires screeching)

776
00:29:16,071 --> 00:29:18,3
(hip-hop music throbbing
from sound system)

777
00:29:24,001 --> 00:29:27,0
(man rapping in Spanish)

778
00:29:28,085 --> 00:29:30,5
Our lucky day.

779
00:29:30,077 --> 00:29:32,5
Viper and the perv.

780
00:29:32,073 --> 00:29:34,0
LUCIFER:
Bravo, crybaby.

781
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:35,5
This is a bold move, isn't it?

782
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:37,3
CHLOE:
Come on, turn around.

783
00:29:37,052 --> 00:29:39,3
If you walk away now,
no one has to get arrested.

784
00:29:39,052 --> 00:29:40,7
No one has to get hurt--

785
00:29:40,098 --> 00:29:42,4
Yeah, they do.
Viper killed my cousin.

786
00:29:42,061 --> 00:29:43,6
I'm here to get justice!

787
00:29:43,086 --> 00:29:44,7
LUCIFER:
As you should.

788
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:46,1
Are you insane?
Shut up.

789
00:29:46,036 --> 00:29:47,8
What?

790
00:29:48,003 --> 00:29:50,1
Please, I promise
we're dealing with this.

791
00:29:50,037 --> 00:29:51,8
You and your perv partner
want to get caught

792
00:29:52,008 --> 00:29:54,0
in the crossfire, cop,
be my guest.

793
00:29:54,021 --> 00:29:55,3
(guns cocking)

794
00:29:55,054 --> 00:29:56,3
MAN:
Smoke this piece!

795
00:30:02,005 --> 00:30:03,5
Enough danger for you yet?

796
00:30:03,076 --> 00:30:04,6
YOUNG MAN: Just stay there.
Stay there.

797
00:30:04,088 --> 00:30:05,7
MAN: I'm curious.

798
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,2
Right.

799
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,1
This ain't about you,
it's about Viper!

800
00:30:19,056 --> 00:30:21,2
Hey, now if you'd just give
me that gun I'd asked for--

801
00:30:21,048 --> 00:30:22,4
- Stop talking.
- Okay.

802
00:30:23,019 --> 00:30:24,4
Diego?

803
00:30:25,036 --> 00:30:27,2
Diego, put down your weapon.

804
00:30:27,045 --> 00:30:28,9
Don't listen to her.

805
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,6
This isn't
what you want.

806
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:33,4
Taking down Viper
is exactly what he wants.

807
00:30:33,066 --> 00:30:35,4
We're doing it for Paola!
Step off!

808
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:38,2
I said step off!

809
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:40,0
You know,
as the Master of Punishment,

810
00:30:40,021 --> 00:30:41,8
I completely understand
your desire to make Viper pay

811
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:43,5
for the tragic death
of your cousin...

812
00:30:43,071 --> 00:30:45,0
Lucifer, you do remember
that bullets hurt, right?

813
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:47,6
And furthermore,
you do seem to have

814
00:30:47,084 --> 00:30:49,0
this danger thing down pat,

815
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,5
don't you?

816
00:30:50,072 --> 00:30:51,7
I mean the Devil
could learn a thing or two.

817
00:30:51,093 --> 00:30:52,7
DANI:
The Devil?

818
00:30:52,097 --> 00:30:53,9
The hell you
talking about?

819
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,9
LUCIFER:
So, answer me this:

820
00:30:56,018 --> 00:30:57,3
So, you engage in turf wars,

821
00:30:57,056 --> 00:30:58,3
yet nobody actually
owns any turf?

822
00:30:58,056 --> 00:30:59,6
DIEGO:
Get back, freak!

823
00:30:59,081 --> 00:31:00,6
All right, let's finish this.

824
00:31:00,081 --> 00:31:02,0
And-and those trousers.

825
00:31:02,023 --> 00:31:03,5
I mean, you wear them
so low that,

826
00:31:03,073 --> 00:31:05,8
well, your ass is exposed
to other naughty men,

827
00:31:06,003 --> 00:31:07,5
and we all know what kind
of danger that can bring,

828
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:08,9
don't we? I mean, you can
park your bike in there.

829
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,1
You making fun of his pants, yo?

830
00:31:11,037 --> 00:31:12,5
Well, are we talking
pants or trousers?

831
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,7
Because it's very confusing.

832
00:31:15,045 --> 00:31:16,4
Where'd he go?

833
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,6
Oh, dear.
DIEGO:
Don't matter.

834
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:21,6
I'll kill you first.

835
00:31:23,034 --> 00:31:25,0
(switches clicking)

836
00:31:25,026 --> 00:31:26,3
MAN: Hey, what's happening?
(men clamoring)

837
00:31:26,055 --> 00:31:28,5
(grunting)
Where's Viper?

838
00:31:28,072 --> 00:31:30,1
You had your hero moment--
stay down,

839
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:31,3
or you're gonna get shot!

840
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,9
LUCIFER:
Indeed!

841
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:37,8
- What's that?
- What happened?

842
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:40,6
(men grunting)

843
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:42,8
What the hell
is happening?

844
00:31:45,007 --> 00:31:46,1
(sharp crack, man yells)

845
00:31:47,057 --> 00:31:48,7
Maze is happening.

846
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:49,7
Your bartender's a ninja?

847
00:31:49,099 --> 00:31:51,5
- Of course she is.
- Yeah.

848
00:31:51,074 --> 00:31:53,1
What's that?

849
00:31:53,037 --> 00:31:55,2
(man shouts, grunts)

850
00:31:55,041 --> 00:31:56,2
Shattered tibia.

851
00:31:57,091 --> 00:32:00,0
Ooh, ouch-- orbital fracture.

852
00:32:00,021 --> 00:32:01,8
(grunting)

853
00:32:02,008 --> 00:32:04,0
It was first perfected
in the hellfires of Tyre.

854
00:32:06,021 --> 00:32:07,2
(cracking)

855
00:32:07,042 --> 00:32:09,8
Oh, the humerus crush!
(laughs)

856
00:32:10,005 --> 00:32:11,9
(men groaning)
LUCIFER: Love that Maze!

857
00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:22,0
(Diego yelling)

858
00:32:22,027 --> 00:32:23,1
(gun clatters away)

859
00:32:28,069 --> 00:32:29,5
(groans)

860
00:32:31,024 --> 00:32:32,7
(Maze and men moaning, grunting)

861
00:32:32,095 --> 00:32:34,6
(applauding)
Oh, bravo, Detective.

862
00:32:34,082 --> 00:32:36,4
(chuckles)

863
00:32:39,008 --> 00:32:40,0
Ass saved.

864
00:32:40,029 --> 00:32:41,0
You're welcome.

865
00:32:41,029 --> 00:32:43,2
His ass, not yours.

866
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:54,9
(gangsters groaning)

867
00:32:57,089 --> 00:32:59,3
(clicking)

868
00:32:59,052 --> 00:33:01,1
Let's go.

869
00:33:07,082 --> 00:33:09,2
Care to tell me
what happened?

870
00:33:09,048 --> 00:33:10,6
(sighs)

871
00:33:10,086 --> 00:33:12,1
You wouldn't believe me
if I did.

872
00:33:14,061 --> 00:33:16,9
They found a gun
in Viper's bag.

873
00:33:17,012 --> 00:33:18,2
CHLOE:
It's a.38.

874
00:33:18,049 --> 00:33:19,4
Same caliber fired
at Benny's show.

875
00:33:21,062 --> 00:33:22,4
Um...

876
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:23,6
What?

877
00:33:23,087 --> 00:33:24,7
You should
know something.

878
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,2
Okay.

879
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,9
I talked to Lucifer
about you the other day.

880
00:33:28,017 --> 00:33:29,3
Yeah, I heard.

881
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:31,4
I mean, not that
it got me anywhere.

882
00:33:31,063 --> 00:33:33,6
If anyone can handle themselves
around that wack job, it's you.

883
00:33:35,059 --> 00:33:37,4
And, hey, it looks like, uh...

884
00:33:37,064 --> 00:33:38,6
you got the bad guy.

885
00:33:41,014 --> 00:33:42,6
Yeah.

886
00:33:42,081 --> 00:33:43,8
Looks like.

887
00:33:59,016 --> 00:34:01,3
What, no "thank you"?

888
00:34:01,054 --> 00:34:03,5
I don't know why you're upset.

889
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:05,1
I helped save kids.

890
00:34:05,037 --> 00:34:06,3
And we arrested our shooter.

891
00:34:06,058 --> 00:34:07,5
One might say I did you a favor.

892
00:34:07,071 --> 00:34:09,3
Hmm.

893
00:34:09,054 --> 00:34:10,7
Yeah, I think
I just figured it out,

894
00:34:10,092 --> 00:34:11,8
why you do these favors.

895
00:34:12,005 --> 00:34:14,0
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

896
00:34:14,022 --> 00:34:15,3
It's about power.

897
00:34:15,055 --> 00:34:16,8
It makes you feel superior.

898
00:34:17,005 --> 00:34:18,2
In control.

899
00:34:18,043 --> 00:34:19,3
You're addicted
to creating chaos

900
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,6
and seeing where the chips fall,

901
00:34:20,089 --> 00:34:22,5
to hell with
the consequences.

902
00:34:22,072 --> 00:34:24,3
It's like you have
some kind of god complex.

903
00:34:26,014 --> 00:34:27,3
I most certainly do not.

904
00:34:27,056 --> 00:34:28,3
You do a favor
for one person,

905
00:34:28,056 --> 00:34:29,7
someone else suffers.

906
00:34:29,094 --> 00:34:31,1
When you gave Benny that favor,

907
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,8
you damned Viper
to prison.

908
00:34:33,007 --> 00:34:33,9
Twice.

909
00:34:34,015 --> 00:34:35,0
Whether he's guilty or not.

910
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,2
♪♪

911
00:34:46,058 --> 00:34:48,5
(Yellow Viper sighs deeply)

912
00:34:54,038 --> 00:34:55,8
What?

913
00:34:56,009 --> 00:34:57,5
Stop staring.

914
00:34:57,072 --> 00:34:58,8
You're having another one
of those "gut feelings,"

915
00:34:59,009 --> 00:35:00,2
aren't you?

916
00:35:00,047 --> 00:35:01,6
Like you had
on the Palmetto case.

917
00:35:01,085 --> 00:35:02,9
This has nothing
to do with Palmetto.

918
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:04,4
Au contraire.

919
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,6
I think it has everything
to do with it.

920
00:35:05,089 --> 00:35:07,1
See? Addicted to creating chaos,

921
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:08,5
- talking out of your ass...
- Like I said:

922
00:35:08,077 --> 00:35:10,2
you were trusting
your instincts

923
00:35:10,048 --> 00:35:12,1
on that case, just like
you're trusting them now.

924
00:35:12,036 --> 00:35:15,1
I mean, why would
a seasoned parolee

925
00:35:15,032 --> 00:35:17,6
bring a gun to
a children's art class?

926
00:35:17,082 --> 00:35:19,4
For all we know,
Mr. Viper is innocent.

927
00:35:19,061 --> 00:35:21,8
I am innocent, man!

928
00:35:22,008 --> 00:35:23,3
See?

929
00:35:23,058 --> 00:35:24,7
What do you know?
Our suspect has ears.

930
00:35:24,095 --> 00:35:25,9
Let's see if
he has a conscience,

931
00:35:26,012 --> 00:35:27,9
as well, shall we?

932
00:35:28,012 --> 00:35:28,9
Mr. Viper.

933
00:35:29,012 --> 00:35:30,4
Mr. Viper...

934
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:33,5
Hello.

935
00:35:33,075 --> 00:35:35,2
You've already wasted
so much of your life.

936
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:37,6
What do you desire to do

937
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:39,3
with the rest of
your time on Earth?

938
00:35:40,093 --> 00:35:42,5
All I want to do is my art.

939
00:35:42,076 --> 00:35:45,5
I swear I didn't
shoot up Benny's show.

940
00:35:45,077 --> 00:35:47,6
If I hated him so much,

941
00:35:47,085 --> 00:35:49,6
why would I bother
to go after him and miss?

942
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:52,4
Oh.

943
00:35:52,065 --> 00:35:54,3
Yes, he's got a point, actually.

944
00:35:54,057 --> 00:35:57,4
I mean, to pop off in a crowd
like that and not hit anyone,

945
00:35:57,061 --> 00:35:59,1
he'd have to be
the worst shot in the world.

946
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:01,3
Or the best.

947
00:36:04,045 --> 00:36:05,7
(tires screeching)

948
00:36:05,095 --> 00:36:07,1
Steady on, Detective.

949
00:36:12,042 --> 00:36:14,0
BENNY:
It's my Pig Diddy piece.

950
00:36:14,025 --> 00:36:16,5
Collector in Dubai
offered me 150 G's for it.

951
00:36:16,084 --> 00:36:17,9
I want you to have it.

952
00:36:18,017 --> 00:36:19,3
As thanks for saving my life.

953
00:36:19,055 --> 00:36:20,5
Again.

954
00:36:20,076 --> 00:36:22,3
(exhales)

955
00:36:22,059 --> 00:36:25,1
Yes, my favor really did pay
off for you, didn't it, Benny?

956
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:26,6
You're a huge star.

957
00:36:26,081 --> 00:36:28,5
(laughs)

958
00:36:28,077 --> 00:36:30,6
But if there's one thing
the Devil abhors, it's a fake.

959
00:36:30,085 --> 00:36:32,4
What are you talking about?

960
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,4
I'm all about authenticity.

961
00:36:34,061 --> 00:36:36,2
Sure.
Except for the lying.

962
00:36:36,044 --> 00:36:37,9
You failed
to inform me

963
00:36:38,011 --> 00:36:39,4
that in getting you
off the B&E charge,

964
00:36:39,061 --> 00:36:41,1
suspicion would immediately fall

965
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,2
on your best friend.

966
00:36:42,049 --> 00:36:44,2
I had no control over that.

967
00:36:44,045 --> 00:36:45,2
VIPER:
Didn't you?

968
00:36:45,045 --> 00:36:46,9
Oh...

969
00:36:49,008 --> 00:36:50,3
Hey, it's good to see you, man.

970
00:36:50,058 --> 00:36:51,8
I missed you, bro.

971
00:36:52,008 --> 00:36:53,9
That why you never came
to visit me in prison?

972
00:36:54,013 --> 00:36:55,4
BENNY: I wish I could've
done more.

973
00:36:55,067 --> 00:36:56,5
Framing him for shooting up
your fashion show

974
00:36:56,075 --> 00:36:57,9
surely didn't help.

975
00:36:58,017 --> 00:36:59,3
CHLOE: Viper was always
the real talent.

976
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:00,6
When you heard
he was getting released,

977
00:37:00,088 --> 00:37:01,8
you tried to take down
the competition

978
00:37:02,005 --> 00:37:03,3
before he could take down you.

979
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:05,1
(Benny scoffs)
Planned a simple frame job.

980
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:07,3
Parole violation that would
send Viper back to prison.

981
00:37:07,051 --> 00:37:08,8
But when Paola
Cortez died,

982
00:37:09,006 --> 00:37:10,4
you had to improvise,
didn't you?

983
00:37:10,064 --> 00:37:12,1
You knew pointing
the fingers at Latin Kings

984
00:37:12,031 --> 00:37:13,7
would eventually
get back to me.

985
00:37:13,098 --> 00:37:15,6
How the hell could I have
staged that frame job?

986
00:37:15,086 --> 00:37:17,5
How could I have pointed
a gun at myself?

987
00:37:17,073 --> 00:37:19,1
Because you didn't
pull the trigger.

988
00:37:19,032 --> 00:37:21,6
So many bullets fired
into that crowd.

989
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:23,3
How did no one get hit?

990
00:37:23,057 --> 00:37:25,2
That takes precision.

991
00:37:25,041 --> 00:37:27,9
CHLOE:
I saw your Marine tattoo
when I met you, Hector.

992
00:37:28,016 --> 00:37:28,9
A heart in crosshairs.

993
00:37:29,016 --> 00:37:30,4
Sniper unit.

994
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:32,0
Best marksmen
in the world.

995
00:37:32,021 --> 00:37:35,2
Did you know firing a gun
into a crowd

996
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:36,9
is a felony?

997
00:37:37,017 --> 00:37:38,8
You're responsible
for Paola's murder.

998
00:37:39,005 --> 00:37:40,6
Unless, of course, you were just

999
00:37:40,084 --> 00:37:41,9
doing someone a favor.

1000
00:37:42,017 --> 00:37:43,6
No, man. Hey...

1001
00:37:43,084 --> 00:37:46,0
Benny made me do it!
I'll testify, man.

1002
00:37:46,022 --> 00:37:48,0
He told me
he'd make me a partner.

1003
00:37:48,026 --> 00:37:50,3
But then he made me
plant the gun

1004
00:37:50,056 --> 00:37:52,2
on Viper.

1005
00:37:52,048 --> 00:37:54,3
And kill Pig Diddy.

1006
00:37:57,019 --> 00:37:58,1
I loved that pig, man.

1007
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,5
Oh...

1008
00:37:59,073 --> 00:38:00,8
Well, the good
news is

1009
00:38:01,003 --> 00:38:03,2
that whilst all dogs
go to Heaven,

1010
00:38:03,049 --> 00:38:05,2
you'd be surprised how many pigs
are waiting for you in Hell.

1011
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,9
CHLOE: Okay, let's go.

1012
00:38:08,028 --> 00:38:09,2
You were never good as me, man.

1013
00:38:09,049 --> 00:38:10,2
You were never
good as me, man!

1014
00:38:10,049 --> 00:38:11,6
- Never!
- What?

1015
00:38:11,087 --> 00:38:13,3
I don't think so,
Sonny G.

1016
00:38:13,058 --> 00:38:14,4
BENNY:
Not my...

1017
00:38:16,096 --> 00:38:18,8
(groans)

1018
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,8
Mm.

1019
00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:24,3
I'm no expert
on L.A. street art,

1020
00:38:24,055 --> 00:38:26,0
but it's funny...

1021
00:38:26,026 --> 00:38:28,0
this piece seems a lot more
authentic to me now.

1022
00:38:34,064 --> 00:38:37,0
I think I'll keep it.

1023
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:39,4
(screaming)

1024
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,7
(scream fades)

1025
00:38:43,099 --> 00:38:45,1
FEMALE REPORTER:
We're here live

1026
00:38:45,036 --> 00:38:47,5
at the location of
the impromptu shrine

1027
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:49,8
for Paola Cortez,
the young art school student

1028
00:38:50,007 --> 00:38:51,4
killed at the fashion show

1029
00:38:51,066 --> 00:38:53,4
for artist/designer Benny Choi,

1030
00:38:53,066 --> 00:38:55,9
who has been arrested
for the killing.

1031
00:38:56,016 --> 00:38:57,8
OLIVIA: (clears throat) Can we
start, please? Excuse me.
WOMAN: Yes, ma'am.

1032
00:38:58,004 --> 00:38:59,6
Thank you.

1033
00:38:59,088 --> 00:39:01,2
(sighing):
The mother...

1034
00:39:01,046 --> 00:39:04,2
of Paola Cortez can rest
a little easier tonight,

1035
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:05,6
knowing that
her daughter's killer

1036
00:39:05,084 --> 00:39:07,8
is behind bars.

1037
00:39:08,001 --> 00:39:09,5
The arrest of Benny Choi

1038
00:39:09,076 --> 00:39:11,1
and several of
the Latin Kings membership

1039
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,4
is a reminder

1040
00:39:12,064 --> 00:39:14,7
that my LAPD

1041
00:39:14,097 --> 00:39:16,6
means justice for all.

1042
00:39:20,006 --> 00:39:22,5
You know, I'd love to make
that woman cry for real.

1043
00:39:22,073 --> 00:39:24,7
She's gonna be chief of police
because of you.

1044
00:39:24,098 --> 00:39:26,0
- Mm.
- (sighs)

1045
00:39:26,028 --> 00:39:27,4
I don't know how you do it.

1046
00:39:27,061 --> 00:39:29,5
I simply made good on a favor.

1047
00:39:29,078 --> 00:39:31,5
- Aren't you the little saint?
- Oh, no, no.

1048
00:39:31,078 --> 00:39:33,5
This time, I called in my IOU.

1049
00:39:33,078 --> 00:39:35,6
Olivia got what she wanted,

1050
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:37,5
and I got what I wanted.

1051
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:39,9
Oh, don't say it.
Come on, don't say it.

1052
00:39:40,012 --> 00:39:42,2
I am now an official
civilian consultant

1053
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,8
for the LAPD.

1054
00:39:44,005 --> 00:39:45,8
- Oh.
- Not that there's
anything civil

1055
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:46,8
about the Devil.

1056
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:47,9
What fun would that be?

1057
00:39:50,076 --> 00:39:51,5
Okay, then.

1058
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,6
You win.

1059
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,9
We're partners.

1060
00:39:54,018 --> 00:39:55,6
What, you're not
going to protest?

1061
00:39:55,085 --> 00:39:57,0
Actually, no.

1062
00:39:57,027 --> 00:40:00,3
I may have no idea
what your angle is, but...

1063
00:40:00,052 --> 00:40:01,9
at least now
I can keep my eye on you.

1064
00:40:02,019 --> 00:40:03,8
Keep your enemies close, right?

1065
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:05,5
Close?

1066
00:40:05,073 --> 00:40:07,6
So does this mean
you're gonna take me home

1067
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:09,2
and consummate our new
arrangement, then, Detective?

1068
00:40:12,045 --> 00:40:14,6
(laughs)

1069
00:40:16,087 --> 00:40:18,5
Oh.

1070
00:40:18,075 --> 00:40:19,9
I'll take that as a yes.

1071
00:40:26,042 --> 00:40:27,5
(engine starts)

1072
00:40:27,076 --> 00:40:28,9
Seriously?

1073
00:40:29,017 --> 00:40:30,4
What, you're just gonna
leave me here?

1074
00:40:30,063 --> 00:40:31,5
In this part of town?

1075
00:40:31,076 --> 00:40:32,9
You said you wanted danger.

1076
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:33,9
What...?

1077
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:36,8

00:40:44,023 --> 00:40:45,9
