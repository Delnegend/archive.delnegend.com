00:00:01,033 --> 00:00:03,5
LUCIFER:
Previously on Lucifer:

2
00:00:03,075 --> 00:00:04,7
Lucifer Morningstar.

3
00:00:04,092 --> 00:00:06,7
Is that a stage name
or something?

4
00:00:06,092 --> 00:00:08,5
God-given, I'm afraid.

5
00:00:08,071 --> 00:00:09,9
Your return to
the Underworld

6
00:00:10,013 --> 00:00:11,3
has been requested.

7
00:00:11,055 --> 00:00:13,5
Remind Dad that I quit Hell

8
00:00:13,072 --> 00:00:15,8
because I was sick and tired
of playing a part in his play.

9
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,0
Oh, don't say it.
Come on, don't say it.

10
00:00:18,022 --> 00:00:22,0
I'm now an official civilian
consultant for the LAPD.

11
00:00:22,023 --> 00:00:23,8
I want what's best for Lucifer.

12
00:00:24,006 --> 00:00:25,8
Then give me something that
I can use against Lucifer,

13
00:00:26,002 --> 00:00:27,5
and I'll make sure you're both
back where you belong.

14
00:00:27,077 --> 00:00:29,4
He doesn't confide
in me anymore.

15
00:00:29,065 --> 00:00:33,0
But there is someone
he does talk to-- a doctor.

16
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:34,6
Hello there, neighbor.

17
00:00:34,086 --> 00:00:37,9
I actually need someone
to confide in about a patient.

18
00:00:38,016 --> 00:00:39,7
And hey, listen,
if you have any patients

19
00:00:39,091 --> 00:00:42,3
- you need to talk about...
- You have no idea.

20
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:44,0
Just shoot me,
Detective, please,

21
00:00:44,021 --> 00:00:45,5
because maybe
you'll finally realize...

22
00:00:47,021 --> 00:00:48,0
You're bleeding.

23
00:00:48,025 --> 00:00:49,8
What's happening to me?

24
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:52,8
You're changing,
becoming vulnerable.

25
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:54,5
Maybe even...
(whispers): mortal.

26
00:00:54,076 --> 00:00:57,3
Oh, Mazie. I know that
you'll always protect me.

27
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,8
No matter how mortal I become,
the Devil can depend on that.

It's just cake, Chloe.

Cake is so not the point, Dan.

74
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:44,7
This is about honesty

75
00:03:44,093 --> 00:03:46,3
and personal
responsibility.

00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,2
Fine.

Hey, Monkey.

79
00:03:56,082 --> 00:03:59,1
Do you remember
when we had that talk

80
00:03:59,032 --> 00:04:01,3
and we said that lying
is a really bad thing?

81
00:04:01,053 --> 00:04:02,9
Well,

82
00:04:03,011 --> 00:04:04,7
some of your birthday cake
is missing.

83
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:06,9
Now, I didn't eat it,

84
00:04:07,016 --> 00:04:10,0
and we know Mommy
didn't eat it, so...

85
00:04:10,029 --> 00:04:11,3
is there something
you want to tell us?

86
00:04:15,034 --> 00:04:16,6
I ate it.

87
00:04:17,071 --> 00:04:18,5
Mm-hmm.

88
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,8
But Lucifer said it was okay.

89
00:04:21,001 --> 00:04:22,5
Oh, really?

90
00:04:22,072 --> 00:04:23,5
(scoffs)

91
00:04:23,072 --> 00:04:25,3
He said, if you really want

92
00:04:25,051 --> 00:04:27,3
to do something, you should.

93
00:04:29,014 --> 00:04:31,5
And I really wanted
to eat some chocolate cake.

94
00:04:31,077 --> 00:04:33,5
Huh. That's...

95
00:04:34,094 --> 00:04:36,2
...interesting.

96
00:04:38,098 --> 00:04:40,5

go grab your stuff.

99
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:48,9
is on the personal
responsibility lesson plan.

102
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,0

is none of my business,

Okay, just don't forget tomorrow
night's Taco Tuesday, okay?

I can't do it.
Why?

I'm working a stakeout
in Van Nuys.

110
00:05:09,064 --> 00:05:11,8
We agreed on planned family time
so that Trixie

can maintain some normalcy
during the separation.

Suffocation; a crushed trachea.

And this heap has a name.

161
00:07:00,017 --> 00:07:02,8
Erwin Scovell, 55. He worked
security here for 20 years.

162

Ooh, talk about suffocating.

Vice suspects this place

164
00:07:05,055 --> 00:07:06,9
has been used

Container went missing,

A little respect.

00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:24,9
Do you know, I am amazed
by the deferential regard

173
00:07:25,015 --> 00:07:26,5
you people hold
for rotting flesh.

174
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:29,3
I mean, this poor sap's
either already in Hell

175
00:07:29,057 --> 00:07:31,8
or in the Silver City enduring
Uriel's welcome speech,

176
00:07:32,007 --> 00:07:34,1
which is far worse than
Hell, if you ask me.

177
00:07:34,033 --> 00:07:36,1
Let's pretend for one second
that you're someone else.

178
00:07:36,037 --> 00:07:38,2
Someone nice,
someone mature.

179
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,2
Ooh, I love role-play.

180
00:07:40,046 --> 00:07:41,6
Great.

181
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,4
So, since we don't have
any leads,

182
00:07:43,067 --> 00:07:45,3
let's focus on the next steps
of the investigation,

183
00:07:45,055 --> 00:07:47,1
like what was in
the stolen container.

184
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:49,4
But I've already solved it.
I know what killed Erwin.

185
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:50,6
What?

186
00:07:50,084 --> 00:07:52,1
Boredom.

187
00:07:52,034 --> 00:07:53,8
I mean, getting murdered
is probably

188
00:07:54,005 --> 00:07:55,9
the most exciting thing
that ever happened to him.

189
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:58,6
When do we get to raid
a drug house or shoot someone?

190
00:07:58,081 --> 00:08:01,2
I mean, I gave up
an epic foursome to be here.

191
00:08:01,044 --> 00:08:04,1
A man died, and we're going
to do everything we possibly can

192
00:08:04,036 --> 00:08:05,4
to catch the killer.

193
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:06,9
Pass.

194
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:08,6
Are you joking?

195
00:08:08,086 --> 00:08:09,9
Hard pass.

196
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:12,1
Hey! After all
of your manipulations

197
00:08:12,032 --> 00:08:14,6
to get to work with me,
you're really gonna walk away

198
00:08:14,082 --> 00:08:16,3
because you think
this case is boring?

199
00:08:16,058 --> 00:08:19,0
Just call me when you've
got a murder with a pulse.

200
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,5
Or at least someone
good-looking.

201
00:08:21,071 --> 00:08:23,2
I mean...

202
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:26,6
Is the Brittany buffet
still serving?

203
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,6
Okay, got it.
Huh?

204
00:08:28,084 --> 00:08:30,4
God, I was hoping
for a good shag

205
00:08:30,063 --> 00:08:32,0
just as a
palate cleanser

206
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,8
to wipe the foul taste of
boredom from my mouth.

207
00:08:34,001 --> 00:08:35,5
We need to talk.

208
00:08:35,072 --> 00:08:37,5
Well, as long as it's
not the detective's

209
00:08:37,072 --> 00:08:39,8
homicide/robbery snoozefest
at the docks, I'm all ears.

210
00:08:40,006 --> 00:08:41,6
You know, I don't
know how they do it.

211
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:44,5
40 hours a week,
52 weeks a year, 50 years.

212
00:08:44,077 --> 00:08:47,0
I mean, I didn't leave Hell
just to step into another one.

213
00:08:47,023 --> 00:08:50,4
Yeah, well, about that
robbery/homicide snoozefest:

214
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:53,7
The container that's missing,
it was yours.

215
00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:56,8
What container?

216
00:08:57,007 --> 00:08:58,9
The container.

217
00:09:02,087 --> 00:09:04,7
♪♪

218
00:09:18,005 --> 00:09:19,9
MAZE: Didn't you hear
what I just said?

219
00:09:20,014 --> 00:09:21,3
The container is missing.

220
00:09:21,056 --> 00:09:23,2
I heard you.

221
00:09:23,043 --> 00:09:25,5
Then why aren't we out there
recovering it?

222
00:09:25,073 --> 00:09:27,6
Why fuss? I suppose
if somebody wants it

223
00:09:27,086 --> 00:09:29,4
badly enough to steal it,

224
00:09:29,061 --> 00:09:31,4
then perhaps they
should have it, then.

225
00:09:31,069 --> 00:09:33,9
Really?
Mm-hmm.

226
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,7
This doesn't upset you?

227
00:09:35,095 --> 00:09:37,7
I don't know
what to tell you, Maze.

228
00:09:37,095 --> 00:09:40,3
I guess it's not that important
to me after all.

229
00:09:41,049 --> 00:09:43,5
Well, it's your container...

230
00:09:43,075 --> 00:09:45,6
and your reputation.

231
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:48,7
What about my reputation?

232
00:09:48,096 --> 00:09:51,5
Well, apparently,
it's okay to steal from you now.

233
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,4
But...

234
00:09:53,063 --> 00:09:55,8
if it doesn't bother you...
doesn't bother me.

235
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,8
(wry laugh)

236
00:10:03,031 --> 00:10:04,9
(groans quietly)

237
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,0
OFFICER: We're canvassing
the entire area

238
00:10:08,027 --> 00:10:09,2
for witnesses now, ma'am.

239
00:10:09,048 --> 00:10:10,2
CHLOE:
Okay, good. Let's check

240
00:10:10,048 --> 00:10:11,4
with the nearby businesses,

241
00:10:11,061 --> 00:10:12,4
- All right.
- and check the--

242
00:10:12,065 --> 00:10:14,1
- Yeah.
- Excuse me.

243
00:10:14,032 --> 00:10:15,6
What? Have you thought
of all new offensive things

244
00:10:15,086 --> 00:10:17,2
- to say?
- No, I've changed mind.

245
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,9
I've come back to help.
Any leads yet?

246
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,9
I need your help
like I need a third boob.

247
00:10:21,016 --> 00:10:22,4
- Mmm!
- Wait.

248
00:10:22,066 --> 00:10:24,3
Don't say a word.
Knew it was a mistake

249
00:10:24,054 --> 00:10:26,4
- the minute
it came out of my mouth.
- We're partners,

250
00:10:26,062 --> 00:10:28,3
and I'm offering you
my services.

251
00:10:28,058 --> 00:10:30,0
I think you need
a refresher course

252
00:10:30,033 --> 00:10:31,5
on how partnership works.

253
00:10:31,071 --> 00:10:33,1
You left me hanging, remember?

254
00:10:33,038 --> 00:10:34,9
Yes, but now I'm here
because of the robbery.

255
00:10:35,017 --> 00:10:36,6
Robbery? Why?

256
00:10:36,088 --> 00:10:38,6
Because the container
that was stolen was mine.

257
00:10:38,084 --> 00:10:41,3
You somehow
left that out before.

258
00:10:41,051 --> 00:10:42,8
Well, I didn't know before.

259
00:10:43,001 --> 00:10:44,2
Maze handles logistics--
storage and such.

260
00:10:44,047 --> 00:10:46,6
And did you know
that this facility was used

261
00:10:46,081 --> 00:10:49,0
- to house illegal contraband?
- No.

262
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,5
But what better place
to store my stuff

263
00:10:50,077 --> 00:10:51,6
than somewhere people
hide illicit goods?

264
00:10:51,081 --> 00:10:53,0
Asking the obvious here,

265
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,2
but was your stuff
illegal contraband, too?

266
00:10:55,044 --> 00:10:57,1
Define "illegal."

267
00:10:57,036 --> 00:10:59,0
What was in the container?

268
00:10:59,024 --> 00:11:01,6
- A personal item, insignificant.
- Yeah, but what was in it?

269
00:11:01,087 --> 00:11:03,2
The only thing I brought
with me to Los Angeles.

270
00:11:03,049 --> 00:11:04,8
I know, but you're not
answering the question.

271
00:11:05,008 --> 00:11:06,6
Look, I was storing some
stuff, it was stolen,

272
00:11:06,087 --> 00:11:08,4
the theft sets an
awful precedent,

273
00:11:08,062 --> 00:11:10,1
so I'm obliged to make the
person responsible pay.

274
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:12,8
Now, if you let me help,

275
00:11:13,004 --> 00:11:16,4
I'm certain we can
solve this case quickly.

276
00:11:16,063 --> 00:11:17,8
And I have a lead.

277
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,1

278
00:11:23,035 --> 00:11:24,1
Snow cones?

279
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:25,3
This is your lead?

280
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,6
We don't have time for this.

281
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,2
We should be working.

00:11:28,043 --> 00:11:30,0

- Uh, yes.

283
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,6
I'll have two Tropic Wonders

Lucifer, what are
you doing? Stop!

I believe they call this
interrogating.

CHLOE:
Lucifer, stop!

289
00:11:42,045 --> 00:11:43,6
He needs to tell me
where my stuff is.
CHLOE: Don't.

00:11:43,087 --> 00:11:45,2
I just sell snow cones.
CHLOE: Lucifer!

This isn't how
we do things.

This pathetic sap's real name
is Frankie Costa,

293
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:51,2
and his real job is transporting
and storing illegal goods.

294
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,2
Maze set up the warehouse
through him.

295
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,2
So if someone knew to rob it,
he'd be involved.

296
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,7
(grunting nervously)

297
00:11:56,092 --> 00:11:58,2
I wouldn't steal
from my own operation.

298
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,4
That warehouse is
off-limits.

Hey, man.

I'm trying to get out
of the storage racket.

301
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:04,8
Yes, focus, Frankie.

302
00:12:05,005 --> 00:12:05,8
Who took my property?

303
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,0
I don't know.

304
00:12:07,022 --> 00:12:08,8
I'm trying
to find out myself.

305
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,2
This is bad for business.

306
00:12:10,043 --> 00:12:11,2
And who would know about
the storage service?

Who are you?

308
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,0
I'm someone with one of these.

309

But this guy
doesn't have one.

310
00:12:15,044 --> 00:12:16,6
So say if I were
to walk away,

311
00:12:16,082 --> 00:12:18,6
he can do whatever
he wants to you.

312
00:12:18,086 --> 00:12:20,6
Of if you're not responsible,
you can point us

313
00:12:20,086 --> 00:12:22,5
in the right direction
of someone who is. Cool?

314
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:23,9
(gasping):
Okay, okay.

315
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,0
Los Diablos.

316
00:12:26,024 --> 00:12:27,0
The biker club?

317
00:12:27,024 --> 00:12:28,7
Yeah.

318
00:12:28,091 --> 00:12:30,9
I run the warehouse,
but they run the docks.

319
00:12:31,012 --> 00:12:34,0
If anything went down,
they would know about it.

320
00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:35,3
That's all I know.

321
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:36,5
I swear.

322
00:12:36,075 --> 00:12:38,2
All right, all right.

323
00:12:38,042 --> 00:12:39,9
Fine.

324
00:12:43,076 --> 00:12:45,5
That was incredible.

325
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,2
It was musical,
poetic really.

326
00:12:47,047 --> 00:12:48,9
We were like fish and chips,
salt and pepper.

327
00:12:49,014 --> 00:12:50,2
Hipsters
and condescension.

328
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,6
Give me
one good reason

329
00:12:51,085 --> 00:12:53,6
why I shouldn't arrest
you for assault.

330
00:12:53,081 --> 00:12:54,9
Fine, Frankie's
a complete scumbag,

331
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:55,8
and he skimps
on the cherry syrup.

332
00:12:56,006 --> 00:12:57,2
So that's two, actually.

333
00:12:57,044 --> 00:12:58,7
Uh, something's
going on with you,

334
00:12:58,094 --> 00:13:00,2
and it has to do with
that mysterious container,

335
00:13:00,044 --> 00:13:01,4
so no more games--
what's in it?

336
00:13:01,069 --> 00:13:02,7
(huffs)

337
00:13:02,095 --> 00:13:04,3
It was a gift
from my father.

338
00:13:04,057 --> 00:13:05,7
That's still
not an answer.

339
00:13:05,091 --> 00:13:07,0
I mean, what,
was it his memoirs?

340
00:13:07,028 --> 00:13:09,1
Some priceless
porn collection?

341
00:13:09,033 --> 00:13:10,6
Look, if we're gonna
work together on this,

342
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,6
you're gonna have to
trust me, all right?

343
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,4
You're right, we shouldn't
work together on this.

344
00:13:16,063 --> 00:13:17,7
(scoffs)

345
00:13:17,092 --> 00:13:19,9
Aren't we being
a touch dramatic?

346
00:13:20,013 --> 00:13:21,4
You know, I put up
with a lot of crap

347
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:23,3
to let you in on my cases,

348
00:13:23,055 --> 00:13:25,2
and that's because thus far
you've been honest with me,

349
00:13:25,043 --> 00:13:27,0
but now, for some reason, you're
not telling me the full story.

350
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,7
I'm telling you

351
00:13:28,093 --> 00:13:30,6
everything you need to know
to help find my stuff.

352
00:13:30,081 --> 00:13:32,9
A man was murdered, and all you
can talk about is your property?

353
00:13:33,018 --> 00:13:34,9
Yes, but if we find it,
then you find out

354
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:37,4
who killed the security
guard-- it's win-win.

355
00:13:37,061 --> 00:13:39,6
So, please, enlighten me.

356
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:41,6
Under what rock will
we find Los Diablos?

357
00:13:41,082 --> 00:13:43,8
It's a very on-the-nose
name, if you ask me.

358
00:13:44,003 --> 00:13:45,1
We won't find them anywhere.

359
00:13:45,036 --> 00:13:46,7
It's a conflict of interest.

360
00:13:48,082 --> 00:13:50,7
(cell phone rings)

361
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,8
Look, Chloe, I told you, there's
nothing I can do about tomorrow.

362
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:58,1
Truce.

363
00:13:58,038 --> 00:13:59,7
This is a call
for Dan the detective.

364
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,8
All right?

365
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,8
I need your help.

366
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,8
Okay.

367
00:14:03,001 --> 00:14:04,1
It's about my case.

368
00:14:04,034 --> 00:14:05,6
Homicide at the docks.

369
00:14:05,084 --> 00:14:07,1

Yeah, that container
that was stolen,

00:14:09,018 --> 00:14:10,6
it was Lucifer's.

372
00:14:10,085 --> 00:14:13,8
That storage facility was filled
with black market goods.

373
00:14:14,006 --> 00:14:16,6
Yeah, it was.

374
00:14:16,085 --> 00:14:18,8
You think what Lucifer had
stored in there may be illegal.

375
00:14:19,002 --> 00:14:21,1
Whatever is in that container,
he won't tell me.

376
00:14:21,036 --> 00:14:24,1
And for a man who's all about
over-sharing, says a lot,

377
00:14:24,036 --> 00:14:25,4
so I want you to look into him,

378
00:14:25,069 --> 00:14:27,4
try and find out
what he might be hiding.

379
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:29,7
Absolutely.

I need to see your books.

Without any foreplay?

390
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,5

for the last five years.

So?

393
00:14:56,068 --> 00:14:58,4
So this club is
packed every night.

394
00:14:58,069 --> 00:15:00,6
At 20 bucks an appletini,
it doesn't really add up.

395

You're Chloe's ex, right?

pet on a leash.

Now answer the question.

398
00:15:10,061 --> 00:15:12,5
Well, technically,
that wasn't a question.

399
00:15:12,074 --> 00:15:14,0
Is your divorce final yet?

400
00:15:14,024 --> 00:15:15,2

to get a warrant?

00:15:19,062 --> 00:15:20,4
We have nothing to hide.

404
00:15:20,062 --> 00:15:21,5
That's great.

405
00:15:21,075 --> 00:15:23,2
I'll be right here.

406
00:15:23,046 --> 00:15:24,9
Mm-hmm.

407
00:15:25,013 --> 00:15:27,3
Actually, the books
are in the office.

408
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:31,0
And there are way too many of
them to carry all by myself.

409
00:15:31,022 --> 00:15:34,0
But if you come
out back with me,

410
00:15:34,022 --> 00:15:36,2
I'll let you see
whatever you want.

411
00:15:36,047 --> 00:15:38,3
Just the books is fine.

412
00:15:39,077 --> 00:15:41,6

Well, pissed off, of course.

421
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,9
Whatever was stolen from you
must have been very important.

422
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,5
No.

423
00:16:15,072 --> 00:16:18,4
Actually, no, it's
the principle at stake here.

424
00:16:18,064 --> 00:16:21,5
I mean, nobody steals from me
and gets away with it.

425
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,4
This loss brings up an issue
that we've been skirting

426
00:16:25,069 --> 00:16:26,9
since we began
our work together.

427
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:29,2
Right.
Your identity.

428
00:16:29,049 --> 00:16:31,5
(wry laugh) It's still
the Devil, darling.

429
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:35,4
Yes, but who are you
trying so hard to become?

430
00:16:35,062 --> 00:16:36,9
Nobody.

431
00:16:37,016 --> 00:16:39,2
I'm completely unbecoming.
(chuckles)

432
00:16:39,045 --> 00:16:41,4
And yet you keep trying on
many hats to hide your horns.

433
00:16:41,062 --> 00:16:43,6
Playboy, cop, club owner...

434
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:45,9
Yes, you forgot "master
of all things tongue-related."

435
00:16:46,013 --> 00:16:48,0
Speaking of which,
shall we?

436
00:16:48,021 --> 00:16:49,5
That's for later.

437
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,2
I think we're onto something
very important here.

438
00:16:52,047 --> 00:16:56,0
One of the hardest
things we ever do...

439
00:16:56,022 --> 00:16:57,5
is learn to be ourselves.

440
00:16:57,072 --> 00:17:01,5
I want you to tell me
who you believe...

441
00:17:01,073 --> 00:17:04,3
is the real you.

442
00:17:08,023 --> 00:17:09,4
I...

443
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:12,1
(sighs)
I am...

444
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:16,4
...second-guessing
your skills as a therapist.

445
00:17:20,004 --> 00:17:21,2
You're feeling judged.

446
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,6
(chuckles)

447
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,7
So you're lashing out
and judging me.

448
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,7
But that's excellent.

449
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,1
It's transference.

450
00:17:26,038 --> 00:17:27,3
Which means you seek
my approval.

451
00:17:27,058 --> 00:17:29,0
I seek no one's approval.

452
00:17:30,088 --> 00:17:32,2
And time's up.

453
00:17:32,046 --> 00:17:33,8
Suddenly I'm no longer
in the amorous mood.

454
00:17:34,001 --> 00:17:35,8
Okay, hold on...

455
00:17:36,001 --> 00:17:37,6
Hold on, Lucifer.

456
00:17:39,072 --> 00:17:41,2
You think that's a fight.

457
00:17:41,043 --> 00:17:44,0
I think it's progress.

458
00:17:44,027 --> 00:17:47,7
Or maybe I'm just realizing
what a waste of time this is.

459
00:17:47,094 --> 00:17:49,2
(sighs)

460
00:17:53,061 --> 00:17:54,4
(knocking on door)

461
00:17:56,003 --> 00:17:57,8
I'm glad you came ba...

462
00:17:58,007 --> 00:17:59,9
- Oh.
- Is everything okay?

463
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,9
(chuckling):
It's-it's you. Hi.

464
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,0
I'm sorry, it's just,
uh, thin walls.

465
00:18:05,021 --> 00:18:06,0
Oh.

466
00:18:06,021 --> 00:18:07,2
Yes, everything's fine.

467
00:18:09,025 --> 00:18:10,5
Uh, please.

468
00:18:12,034 --> 00:18:13,4
Thanks again for drinks
the other night, Linda.

469
00:18:14,092 --> 00:18:16,2
Uh, yeah.

470
00:18:16,047 --> 00:18:17,6
Yes, that was fun.

471
00:18:17,089 --> 00:18:19,7
Yeah.

472
00:18:19,097 --> 00:18:23,4
All right, so what kind of
parent names their kid Lucifer?

473
00:18:23,064 --> 00:18:25,3
(chuckles)

474
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,8
I'm sorry, I don't mean to
be unprofessional, but...

475
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,6
We're colleagues.
Cone of silence.

476
00:18:28,077 --> 00:18:31,4
And I don't believe
his real name is Lucifer.

477
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,4
We talk in metaphors.

478
00:18:34,061 --> 00:18:35,7
Mmm.

479
00:18:35,094 --> 00:18:38,0
Patients with delusions.

480
00:18:38,028 --> 00:18:39,7
They can be really challenging.

481
00:18:39,091 --> 00:18:42,0
Mm, he's actually
quite charming.

482
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:44,8
Yeah, but even Satan
disguises himself

483
00:18:45,008 --> 00:18:46,2
as an angel of the light.

484
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:49,1
2 Corinthians,
chapter 11, verse 14.

485
00:18:49,037 --> 00:18:50,2
Ah.

486
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:52,9
Two years of seminary school

487
00:18:53,013 --> 00:18:55,5
before I decided I wanted to
help people in a different way.

488
00:18:55,084 --> 00:18:57,8
Ah. Interesting.

489
00:18:58,001 --> 00:19:01,4
I thought you seemed... pure.

490
00:19:01,068 --> 00:19:03,8
(both laugh)

491
00:19:04,001 --> 00:19:05,3
Listen, you really helped me
with my patient the other day,

492
00:19:05,056 --> 00:19:07,2
and I would love to
return the favor.

493
00:19:07,048 --> 00:19:09,9
I know the Bible inside and out,

494
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:12,1
so if you ever need a consult,

495
00:19:12,031 --> 00:19:14,2
just let me know.

496
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,6
(gasps)

497
00:19:29,087 --> 00:19:31,7
(groans quietly)

498
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,2
Whoa.

499
00:19:43,043 --> 00:19:44,7
CHLOE (distant): Just quit
defending him, Mom.

500
00:19:44,097 --> 00:19:47,0
You know Dan's
never gonna change.

501
00:19:49,069 --> 00:19:50,6
Mm-hmm.

502
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:53,7
What's for dinner, Mommy?

503
00:19:53,098 --> 00:19:55,8
Greens, you little cake monster.

504
00:19:56,007 --> 00:19:57,8
Yeah.

505
00:19:58,007 --> 00:20:00,8
I mean, I don't know why
I even bother telling you.

506
00:20:01,007 --> 00:20:04,0
He's-he's not
gonna change, Mom.

507
00:20:04,024 --> 00:20:05,4
You know, Dan's just
the way he is,

508
00:20:05,066 --> 00:20:07,0
and I wasn't asking
for the world.

509
00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:08,7
I just wanted
to see a little effort,

510
00:20:08,095 --> 00:20:10,4
and it's probably too late.

511
00:20:10,062 --> 00:20:14,7
Ah, it's pointless
to discuss this with you.

512
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,0
Why? Because you always
take his side.

513
00:20:19,072 --> 00:20:21,5
Look, Mom, I...

514
00:20:22,068 --> 00:20:23,9
- Daddy!
- Shh!

515
00:20:24,018 --> 00:20:26,2
- Hey, Monkey!
- What are
you doing here?

516
00:20:26,047 --> 00:20:29,3
And why are you wearing
a pillow?

517
00:20:29,056 --> 00:20:31,5
Well, those are... that...
those are great questions,

518
00:20:31,077 --> 00:20:33,9
and I'm gonna answer
both of them later.

519
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:36,2
But right now, I need you
to do something for me.

520
00:20:36,044 --> 00:20:38,1
What?

521
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:40,7
Get me some clothes, and don't
tell Mommy that I'm here.

522
00:20:40,099 --> 00:20:42,7
I thought you said
lying was a bad thing.

523
00:20:42,095 --> 00:20:46,9
It is; it's terrible;
but this-this is different.

524
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:48,3
Because we're gonna
play a game.

525
00:20:48,058 --> 00:20:50,5
It's called "Sneak Daddy
Out of the House."

526
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,2
That still sounds
like a lie.

527
00:20:52,046 --> 00:20:53,6
(sighs)

528
00:20:53,087 --> 00:20:56,1
You know,
it's complicated, Monkey.

529
00:20:56,038 --> 00:20:58,5
You're just gonna have
to go with it, okay?

530
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,2
What's in it for me?

531
00:21:00,042 --> 00:21:02,0
What do you want?

532
00:21:02,026 --> 00:21:04,1
- Chocolate cake.
- Done.

533
00:21:04,034 --> 00:21:07,2
- For a whole year.
- Absolutely not.

534
00:21:07,047 --> 00:21:09,2
Mommy, I'm thirsty!

535
00:21:09,047 --> 00:21:11,2
Okay, fine.

536
00:21:11,048 --> 00:21:13,2
Done.

537
00:21:13,048 --> 00:21:15,9
Now will you please
go get me some clothes?

538
00:21:18,065 --> 00:21:23,7
(dance music playing,
low and indistinct)

539
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:24,9
What the hell
did you do to me?

540
00:21:25,011 --> 00:21:27,2
What do you mean?

541
00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:28,9
One second, I'm
standing here,

542
00:21:29,016 --> 00:21:30,9
next second, I'm in
my ex's bed naked.

543
00:21:31,012 --> 00:21:32,9
Well, you're welcome.

544
00:21:33,012 --> 00:21:34,7
So,

545
00:21:34,096 --> 00:21:36,2
did it work?

546
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:37,3
You two have sex?

547
00:21:37,054 --> 00:21:39,0
No.

548
00:21:39,021 --> 00:21:41,5
Why would you think
that putting me in her bed naked

549
00:21:41,076 --> 00:21:43,1
would get us to have sex?

550
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:45,1
- (sighs)
Always works for me.
- And why would

551
00:21:45,034 --> 00:21:46,6
you even want
Chloe and I to have sex?

552
00:21:46,089 --> 00:21:48,6
So that you and her
will get back together,

553
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,0
and she'll be out
of Lucifer's life.

554
00:21:50,022 --> 00:21:51,3
You're not
from around here, are you?

555
00:21:51,056 --> 00:21:53,8
You have no idea.

556
00:21:53,098 --> 00:21:55,7
You can't just smash two people
together like Barbies,

557
00:21:55,094 --> 00:21:57,5
and think that that's
gonna fix things.

558
00:21:57,073 --> 00:21:59,6
Relationships, they
take time and effort.

559
00:21:59,082 --> 00:22:01,9
And you got to work at it,
like...

560
00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:03,9
it's your job.

561
00:22:04,015 --> 00:22:07,6
Humans are so exhausting.

562
00:22:07,086 --> 00:22:09,9
Here are the books
you wanted to see.

563
00:22:10,016 --> 00:22:12,0
Oh, no, we're not through here.

564
00:22:12,024 --> 00:22:14,1
You assaulted a police officer.

565

I'm taking you in.

566
00:22:16,042 --> 00:22:17,6

567
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:20,0
are you going

568
00:22:21,034 --> 00:22:22,2
Hmm?

569
00:22:24,021 --> 00:22:26,5
That a tiny female bartender

570
00:22:26,072 --> 00:22:28,0
knocked you out,

571
00:22:28,022 --> 00:22:29,8
stripped you naked

572
00:22:30,001 --> 00:22:32,0
and put you in your ex's bed?

573

Lux's books are clean.

How is that even possible?

578
00:22:47,003 --> 00:22:48,4
I had them run for discrepancies
with receivables.

579
00:22:48,061 --> 00:22:49,4
I looked for
hidden payments.

580
00:22:49,066 --> 00:22:51,3

someone, don't tailgate them.

587

what you want.

00:23:13,035 --> 00:23:14,1
Now you have
to deal with it

593
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:15,2
like the rest of us.

594
00:23:15,043 --> 00:23:17,5
I'm sorry.

I apologize.

597
00:23:21,094 --> 00:23:23,2
I crossed the line this
morning with Mr. Snow Cone.

598
00:23:23,044 --> 00:23:24,9
It was a mistake.

599
00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:25,9
I realize that now.

600
00:23:26,019 --> 00:23:27,5
Wow.

601
00:23:27,078 --> 00:23:28,7

that we found under UV light.

611
00:23:45,075 --> 00:23:47,7
Killer must've worn
some kind of bracelet

612
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,3
when he strangled
the security guard.

We heard that you
control the docks,

666
00:25:52,021 --> 00:25:54,1
and if anything goes down,
Los Diablos are in on it.

667
00:25:54,034 --> 00:25:56,3
Really? We're just
a riding club, okay?

668
00:25:56,059 --> 00:26:00,3

669
00:26:00,051 --> 00:26:02,2

shouldn't paint us all

670

in a bad light,
now should it, ma'am?

671
00:26:03,081 --> 00:26:05,2
But it does paint you
as suspects.

672
00:26:05,048 --> 00:26:07,1
Hey, look, just because we have
a reputation as outlaws

673
00:26:07,035 --> 00:26:10,2
doesn't mean we had anything
to do with a murder.

674
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:12,0

675
00:26:12,023 --> 00:26:13,5

677
00:26:15,003 --> 00:26:16,6

00:26:16,086 --> 00:26:18,1

00:26:21,095 --> 00:26:23,5
(chuckles)

680
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:25,1
To own a clothing line.

681
00:26:25,033 --> 00:26:26,1
Oh.

Clothing line?

683
00:26:27,054 --> 00:26:29,9
I-I did not see that one coming.

684
00:26:30,017 --> 00:26:31,9
Yes, managing bikers
must be so exhausting.

685
00:26:32,013 --> 00:26:33,9
All that brawling and pillaging.

686
00:26:34,017 --> 00:26:35,8
I'm 54.
Really?

687
00:26:36,005 --> 00:26:38,0
I'd rather be in my hammock
playing my Stratocaster.

688
00:26:38,026 --> 00:26:40,1
All this motorcycle riding's
enlarged my prostate.

689
00:26:40,035 --> 00:26:41,7
It's unpleasant.

690
00:26:41,097 --> 00:26:43,5
That's an unfortunate
occupational hazard.

691
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:45,1
Tell me about it.

692
00:26:45,031 --> 00:26:46,6
Look, we've trademarked
our name.

693
00:26:46,081 --> 00:26:47,8
We're selling
T-shirts and jackets,

694
00:26:48,002 --> 00:26:48,9
and we're gonna
re-brand and...

695
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,1
(whistles)
go legit.

696
00:26:50,036 --> 00:26:51,7
"Legit."

697
00:26:51,098 --> 00:26:53,8
There's a lot of money
in the apparel industry.

698
00:26:54,007 --> 00:26:56,4
All the more reason
to keep our noses clean.

699
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:58,3
See, we used to cover the docks,
not anymore.

700
00:26:58,057 --> 00:27:01,3
I specifically
ordered them off-limits.

701
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:02,9
Maybe someone missed
the re-branding memo.

702
00:27:03,016 --> 00:27:06,1
Killer wore a bracelet
with an iron cross.

703
00:27:06,037 --> 00:27:08,9
Left an imprint on the dead
security guard at the warehouse.

704
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:12,8
(scoffs)

705
00:27:13,009 --> 00:27:16,1
Look, uh, a lot of bikers
wear iron crosses.

706
00:27:16,038 --> 00:27:18,8
Yeah, well, I'm interested in
your guys who have iron crosses.

707
00:27:20,064 --> 00:27:23,8
Hey, look, I've told you
everything I know.

708
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,3
If you have any
more questions,

709
00:27:25,052 --> 00:27:26,6
feel free to contact
my attorney.

710
00:27:26,089 --> 00:27:27,6

711
00:27:27,089 --> 00:27:29,9

712
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:31,6

LUCIFER:
But why are we leaving?

714
00:27:39,007 --> 00:27:40,2
He's hiding something.

715
00:27:40,045 --> 00:27:41,3
It's obvious.

716
00:27:41,057 --> 00:27:42,8
We need to force
it out of him.

717
00:27:43,003 --> 00:27:44,6
We have this little thing
called due process.

718
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:46,3
We can't just force things
out of people.

719
00:27:46,058 --> 00:27:48,4
Besides, there's an easier way
to get our bad guy.

720
00:27:51,008 --> 00:27:53,4
You saw the look on Cutter's
face when he saw that photo.

721
00:27:53,063 --> 00:27:55,1
He knows exactly
who robbed the docks.

722
00:27:55,034 --> 00:27:57,0
He's gonna need to deal
with this immediately.

723
00:27:57,026 --> 00:27:59,2
Or it puts his plan
to re-brand in jeopardy.

724
00:27:59,042 --> 00:28:00,7
Defying his orders--

725
00:28:00,093 --> 00:28:02,5
it's a huge challenge
to his authority.

726
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,7
He's not gonna want to
deal with this in public.

727
00:28:04,093 --> 00:28:06,2
Bet you the first
person he goes to see

728
00:28:06,043 --> 00:28:07,8
is the owner of
that bracelet.

729
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:10,1
What, so your strategy
is just to sit here, paralyzed,

730
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:12,6
hoping that Cutter
leads us to the suspect?

731
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,0
What a terrible idea.

732
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:15,5
Hmm, you think so?

733
00:28:15,073 --> 00:28:17,1
I do, I mean, for one,

734
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,3
even though Cutter's
no brain surgeon,

735
00:28:18,057 --> 00:28:19,8
surely he wouldn't just--

736
00:28:20,007 --> 00:28:21,0
Wouldn't what?

737
00:28:21,028 --> 00:28:22,5
(bike engine starts)

738
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:29,1

00:28:36,088 --> 00:28:38,7
therapist to the Devil himself.

743
00:28:38,096 --> 00:28:40,1
(both laugh)

744
00:28:40,034 --> 00:28:42,5
I should put that
on the door.

745
00:28:42,072 --> 00:28:44,5
Mm, well, it sounds
like he's dealing

746
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,3
with some genuine issues.

747
00:28:46,055 --> 00:28:48,6
I'm just having such a hard time
getting through to him.

748
00:28:48,085 --> 00:28:51,3
Maybe it's because you've
been humoring his metaphor

749
00:28:51,052 --> 00:28:53,1
without fully embracing it.

750
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,6
You mean, completely accept
that he's actually the Devil?

751
00:28:55,086 --> 00:28:57,4
Mm-hmm.

752
00:28:57,061 --> 00:28:59,4
It's worth a try.

753
00:28:59,065 --> 00:29:02,1
If only I knew someone who could
help me with the Bible.

754
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:03,9
(laughs)

755
00:29:04,016 --> 00:29:06,1
I know so much about it,
it's almost as if I was there.

756
00:29:08,054 --> 00:29:12,2
If he's positioning
himself as the Devil, right?

757
00:29:12,046 --> 00:29:14,0
He must see himself as evil.

758
00:29:14,021 --> 00:29:15,0
Mm!

759
00:29:15,021 --> 00:29:16,1
No.

760
00:29:16,033 --> 00:29:17,7
Actually, he's struggling.

761
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,5
I think he thinks
other people see him as evil.

762
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,4
You seem attached
to this patient.

763
00:29:23,063 --> 00:29:25,0
I am...

764
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,9
very motivated to help him.

765
00:29:28,018 --> 00:29:28,9
I see.

766
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:30,8
Well, um,

767
00:29:31,006 --> 00:29:33,1
every culture in the world

768
00:29:33,035 --> 00:29:35,7
and throughout history,
for that matter,

769
00:29:35,098 --> 00:29:37,6
has its very own myth
of the Devil.

770
00:29:37,086 --> 00:29:39,1
Mm-hmm.

771
00:29:39,036 --> 00:29:41,4
But the one thing
that they all have in common

772
00:29:41,061 --> 00:29:44,6
is that the Devil is
essentially a rebellious son.

773
00:29:44,086 --> 00:29:45,9
Sounds like my guy.

774
00:29:46,011 --> 00:29:47,4
I thought it might.

775
00:29:47,066 --> 00:29:48,9
Now, if you're
really serious

776
00:29:49,012 --> 00:29:50,5
about embracing
the metaphor, Linda--

777
00:29:50,074 --> 00:29:53,5
truly embracing it--
I know how you can get to him.

778
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:55,6
But he might not like
what you have to say.

779
00:29:55,087 --> 00:29:57,1
But will it help him?

780
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:00,3
He may not realize it,
but yes.

781
00:30:00,055 --> 00:30:01,6
Then let's do it.

782
00:30:01,088 --> 00:30:03,3
(chuckles)

783
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:14,9
This is the longest

784
00:30:15,019 --> 00:30:16,6
I've sat in a parked car
and not had sex.

785
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,4
Ew.

786
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,9
You can't enjoy this.

787
00:30:23,011 --> 00:30:24,4
This sitting around endlessly,

788
00:30:24,061 --> 00:30:27,0
waiting for something to happen.

789
00:30:27,028 --> 00:30:29,0
You know, if sitting here
not being entertained

790
00:30:29,028 --> 00:30:30,4
is so terrible,
then maybe it's a sign

791
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,9
you should be somewhere else.

792
00:30:32,012 --> 00:30:33,4
Have I done something
to offend you?

793
00:30:33,062 --> 00:30:36,0
Only every time I see you.

794
00:30:36,029 --> 00:30:37,9
Ha, ha, ha.
No, this is different.

795
00:30:41,042 --> 00:30:43,2
For the first time,
I don't think you're being

796
00:30:43,046 --> 00:30:44,6
honest with me.
You have this

797
00:30:44,084 --> 00:30:46,1
mysterious container
that was stolen

798
00:30:46,034 --> 00:30:48,2
that someone was
willing to kill for.

799
00:30:48,047 --> 00:30:50,8
You make shady deals
with shady people.

800
00:30:51,001 --> 00:30:52,6
You're violent.

801
00:30:52,085 --> 00:30:55,9
Your personal records only go
back five years, and the books

802
00:30:56,018 --> 00:30:57,2
from Lux are way too clean.

803
00:30:57,044 --> 00:30:58,5
It's...

804
00:30:58,077 --> 00:31:00,2
I had Dan go and check it out.

805
00:31:00,048 --> 00:31:02,7
You had Dan
deal with Maze alone?

806
00:31:02,094 --> 00:31:04,3
Oh, dear.
For the first time,

807
00:31:04,053 --> 00:31:06,4
I actually feel sorry
for Detective Douche.

808
00:31:06,061 --> 00:31:08,7
It all points to you
being a criminal.

809
00:31:08,095 --> 00:31:11,0
So what's the big deal?
What if I am a criminal?

810
00:31:11,028 --> 00:31:12,6
I'd have to arrest you.

811
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:14,0
Ooh, whip out the cuffs, then.
Why shy away

812
00:31:14,029 --> 00:31:15,6
from a little bondage fun?
(chuckles)

813
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:17,6

this is serious.

your weirdness

working with you.

817
00:31:28,026 --> 00:31:29,6
So, anyhow...

818
00:31:29,088 --> 00:31:31,4
What a momentous

819
00:31:31,064 --> 00:31:34,1
revelation, Detective Decker.
We should celebrate.

820
00:31:34,035 --> 00:31:35,8
You can celebrate from jail

821
00:31:36,006 --> 00:31:38,1

I'm right about you.

822

00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:11,9
We're just making the salsa.

936
00:39:12,018 --> 00:39:13,8
Great.

937
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:17,3
That smells so yummy.

938
00:39:17,052 --> 00:39:18,7
Oh, good.

939
00:39:18,094 --> 00:39:20,8
LINDA:
I'm glad you came back.

940
00:39:21,006 --> 00:39:22,3
Well, I needed to get
my parking validated.

941
00:39:24,019 --> 00:39:25,8
So your items
were never recovered?

942
00:39:26,003 --> 00:39:26,8
No.

943
00:39:27,003 --> 00:39:28,4
Earlier, you said

944
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:31,2
that the items weren't
that important.

945
00:39:31,049 --> 00:39:34,7
Yet now, you seem very upset
that they're gone.

946
00:39:34,091 --> 00:39:36,0
Well, I'm a walking paradox.

947
00:39:36,025 --> 00:39:38,8
What can I say?

948
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,4
Sometimes we need
to lose something

949
00:39:40,067 --> 00:39:43,3
before we can
understand its value.

950
00:39:43,059 --> 00:39:45,0
I didn't lose anything.

951
00:39:45,021 --> 00:39:46,1
No.

952
00:39:46,038 --> 00:39:47,8
No, you were
a victim of a crime.

953
00:39:48,009 --> 00:39:51,0
It's only natural that
you would feel violated.

954
00:39:51,022 --> 00:39:52,3
And often, our feelings of loss

955
00:39:52,055 --> 00:39:53,8
connect to how we feel...

956
00:39:54,006 --> 00:39:55,7
about who we are.

957
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:57,5
Oh, right.

958
00:39:57,073 --> 00:39:59,0
So we're back on that, are we?

959
00:39:59,023 --> 00:40:00,6
You want to talk
about my identity.

960
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:02,3
Yes, because you're the Devil.

961
00:40:02,052 --> 00:40:03,6
You told me your names.

962
00:40:03,086 --> 00:40:05,6
But you left out a few others.

963
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:07,0
Abaddon.

964
00:40:07,023 --> 00:40:08,4
Belial.

965
00:40:08,061 --> 00:40:10,2
Prince of Darkness...

966
00:40:10,045 --> 00:40:11,9
- Someone's been brushing up
on their Sunday school.
- Yes.

967
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:14,0
But before you fell,
you were known as Samael.

968
00:40:15,058 --> 00:40:16,8
The Lightbringer.

969
00:40:17,004 --> 00:40:19,0
I don't go by that name anymore.

970
00:40:19,029 --> 00:40:21,3
That was a name that connotated
your father's love for you.

971
00:40:21,058 --> 00:40:23,8
(laughing):
Right.

972
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:26,0
Was casting his son into Hell

973
00:40:26,025 --> 00:40:27,8
also an expression of his love?

974
00:40:28,005 --> 00:40:29,6
Oh, God didn't cast you
out of Heaven

975
00:40:29,084 --> 00:40:31,2
because he was angry with you.

976
00:40:31,047 --> 00:40:34,3
How can you presume
to know God's intentions?

977
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,7
Oh, I don't.

978
00:40:35,093 --> 00:40:37,0
I can't.

979
00:40:37,026 --> 00:40:38,3
Then maybe stick
within the limits

980
00:40:38,052 --> 00:40:39,4
of your intellectual capacity.

981
00:40:39,064 --> 00:40:40,8
Or maybe my simplicity

982
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:42,5
offers me a different
perspective.

983
00:40:42,077 --> 00:40:44,2
God cast you out

984
00:40:44,044 --> 00:40:45,9
because He needed you

985
00:40:46,011 --> 00:40:48,2
to do the most
difficult of jobs.

986
00:40:48,044 --> 00:40:51,0
- It was a gift.
- Gift?

987
00:40:51,028 --> 00:40:52,9
He shunned me.

988
00:40:53,011 --> 00:40:54,2
He vilified me.

989
00:40:54,045 --> 00:40:56,2
He made me a torturer!

990
00:40:58,074 --> 00:41:00,2
Can you even begin to fathom
what it was like?

991
00:41:00,045 --> 00:41:03,4
Eons spent

992
00:41:03,067 --> 00:41:05,1
providing a place
for dead mortals

993
00:41:05,033 --> 00:41:07,2
to punish themselves?

994
00:41:07,046 --> 00:41:09,7
I mean, why do they blame me
for all their little failings?

995
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:12,3
As if I'd spent my days
sitting on their shoulder,

996
00:41:12,059 --> 00:41:14,7
forcing them to commit acts
they'd otherwise find repulsive.

997
00:41:14,093 --> 00:41:16,4
"Oh, the Devil made me do it."

998
00:41:16,064 --> 00:41:18,5
I have never made any one
of them do anything.

999
00:41:18,076 --> 00:41:19,7
Never.

1000
00:41:19,097 --> 00:41:22,2
What happened to you is unfair.

1001
00:41:22,048 --> 00:41:23,2
Unfair?

1002
00:41:23,048 --> 00:41:25,0
This is unjust.

1003
00:41:25,023 --> 00:41:27,6
For all eternity,
my name will be invoked

1004
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:29,4
to represent
all their depravity.

1005
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:32,4
That is the gift
that my father gave me.

1006
00:41:32,061 --> 00:41:33,4
It was an act of love.

1007
00:41:33,065 --> 00:41:34,9
How do you know?

1008
00:41:35,016 --> 00:41:37,1
Because you are
his favorite son, Samael.

1009
00:41:37,032 --> 00:41:39,1
Do not call me that, please!

1010
00:41:39,033 --> 00:41:40,9
You are his fallen angel.

1011
00:41:41,016 --> 00:41:41,9
But here's the thing:

1012
00:41:42,016 --> 00:41:43,4
When angels fall,

1013
00:41:43,062 --> 00:41:45,7
they also... rise.

1014
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,0
All you have to do

1015
00:41:47,029 --> 00:41:50,1
is embrace all that you are.

1016
00:41:50,034 --> 00:41:52,0
I can't.

1017
00:41:52,021 --> 00:41:53,8
Yes, you can.

1018
00:41:54,005 --> 00:41:56,1
You just have to be open
to the process...

1019
00:41:56,034 --> 00:41:57,7
You don't understand.

1020
00:41:57,093 --> 00:41:59,6
- I can't!
- But why?

1021
00:41:59,085 --> 00:42:01,8
