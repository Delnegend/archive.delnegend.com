00:00:01,037 --> 00:00:02,7
Previously on Lucifer...

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,9
MAZE: You're the Lord of Hell,

3
00:00:04,013 --> 00:00:05,0
for crying out loud.

4
00:00:05,021 --> 00:00:07,2
Shouldn't you be spending
your valuable time

5
00:00:07,046 --> 00:00:09,5
doing something
more significant?

6
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,3
I'm retired, Maze.
I've got nothing but time.

7
00:00:12,051 --> 00:00:14,8
Your return to the Underworld
has been requested.

8
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,0
Remind Dad that I quit Hell

9
00:00:17,022 --> 00:00:19,5
because I was sick and tired
of playing a part in his play.

10
00:00:19,072 --> 00:00:21,5
We should be out there
solving a homicide

11
00:00:21,069 --> 00:00:23,4
and punishing
those responsible.

12
00:00:23,073 --> 00:00:25,3
We? How could you
possibly help me?

13
00:00:25,056 --> 00:00:27,0
I have the ability

14
00:00:27,023 --> 00:00:28,6
to draw out peoples'
forbidden desires.

15
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,7
I got it. I got it.
The name,

16
00:00:30,094 --> 00:00:32,0
the whole Lucifer thing.

17
00:00:32,024 --> 00:00:33,9
And desire is like
your superpower.

18
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,4
Mm, it's more like
a gift from God really.

19
00:00:35,062 --> 00:00:37,0
You're thinking
about it, aren't you?

20
00:00:37,024 --> 00:00:38,1
See, I wouldn't recommend it.

21
00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:39,3
I'm like walking heroin.

22
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:41,0
Ah, you're the Devil. (laughs)

23
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,4
Mm, correct.

24
00:00:42,062 --> 00:00:44,4
(gunshot, Chloe gasps)

25
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:49,1
(gunshots, Lucifer grunting)

26
00:00:49,038 --> 00:00:51,2
Give me one second.

27
00:00:52,097 --> 00:00:55,0
Please. Please
don't kill me.

28
00:00:55,022 --> 00:00:56,1
You're gonna wish

29
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,5
that's all I did to you.

30
00:00:57,076 --> 00:00:59,1
MAZE:
I just can't understand

31
00:00:59,035 --> 00:01:00,5
why you would save
a human life.

32
00:01:00,077 --> 00:01:02,2
Something different about her

33
00:01:02,043 --> 00:01:04,1
that I don't quite understand,
and it vexes me.

34
00:01:04,039 --> 00:01:05,8
Maybe it's not her
that's different.

35
00:01:06,006 --> 00:01:07,5
LUCIFER:
Right. Here's the deal.

36
00:01:07,073 --> 00:01:09,7
We can have as much
naked cuddle time as you desire,

37
00:01:09,094 --> 00:01:12,3
but you're gonna have
to listen to me, too.

38
00:01:12,057 --> 00:01:14,3
You know, just an existential
dilemma or two. Deal?

39
00:01:14,057 --> 00:01:16,2
LINDA:
Yes.

I ask you to repent!

46
00:01:39,076 --> 00:01:41,3
Repent your sins

Padre, you have no idea how
right you are. (chuckles)

52
00:01:50,073 --> 00:01:52,0
But there's no need
to be angry about it.

53

Enjoy the ride.

MAN:
Bless you.

55
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:56,6
Have you seen the face
of the Devil?

56
00:01:56,086 --> 00:01:59,6
Oh, every morning
in the mirror, pal.

57
00:01:59,082 --> 00:02:00,9
Exactly!

58
00:02:01,012 --> 00:02:02,4
He's in all of us!

59
00:02:02,062 --> 00:02:04,5
In our every moment
of weakness.

60
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,9
Look at this world!

61
00:02:06,016 --> 00:02:08,5
The sin, the lust!

62
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:10,1
It is the Devil's touch.

63
00:02:10,034 --> 00:02:11,9
N-N-No, don't give me
credit for all that.

64
00:02:12,013 --> 00:02:14,2
You humans do plenty
all on your own.

65
00:02:14,046 --> 00:02:16,4
(microphone feedback squeals)

66
00:02:16,067 --> 00:02:17,8
(sighs)

67
00:02:19,059 --> 00:02:20,7
What's your problem, pal?

68
00:02:20,097 --> 00:02:22,7
Excuse me?

69
00:02:22,097 --> 00:02:24,6
Yeah, uh, why don't you move
your shtick along.

70
00:02:24,081 --> 00:02:26,4
Okay, I'm not sharing
my tips with you,

71
00:02:26,064 --> 00:02:28,4
- if that's what you're
angling for.
- Oh.

72
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:30,4
Right. Is this
a performance?

73
00:02:30,061 --> 00:02:32,2
Are you like the Chewbacca and
the Spider-Man down the street?

74
00:02:32,048 --> 00:02:33,9
I have to say,
you're very good.

75
00:02:34,015 --> 00:02:35,5
Yeah, so why don't you
go bother them.

76
00:02:35,078 --> 00:02:36,7
You're bad for my business.

77
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:39,6
Repent! The Devil...

78
00:02:39,086 --> 00:02:41,4
Isn't finished with you yet.

79
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:45,5
You see, what I hate
more than anything is a liar,

80
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:49,5
a charlatan, someone who doesn't
believe in what they say.

81
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:52,2
So what are you gonna do
about it?

82
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,0
Why, make you a believer,
of course.

83
00:02:57,067 --> 00:02:58,6
(screams)

84
00:02:58,088 --> 00:03:00,4
S-S... uh, stay away!

85
00:03:00,068 --> 00:03:01,7
He's the Devil!

86
00:03:01,093 --> 00:03:03,4
You don't understand!

87
00:03:03,064 --> 00:03:05,3
This isn't a performance!
He's the Devil!

88
00:03:05,056 --> 00:03:06,9
He's the Devil!
(crowd clamoring)

89
00:03:07,018 --> 00:03:08,8
It's true. It is true.
(applause)

90
00:03:11,098 --> 00:03:13,8
(chuckles)
Yes, thanks, everyone.

91
00:03:14,007 --> 00:03:16,9
I'm, uh, here till, well, the
end of time, actually. (laughs)

92
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:18,7
LINDA: So you're the Devil.
LUCIFER: Yes.

93
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:23,2
Yes. Well, Satan, Beelzebub,
Old Scratch.

94
00:03:23,045 --> 00:03:25,3
Actually, I like that one
in particular.

95
00:03:25,054 --> 00:03:27,6
But, uh, those were
the old me.

96
00:03:27,087 --> 00:03:29,6
These days, you just have
plain old Lucifer.

97
00:03:29,087 --> 00:03:33,3
And you've left Hell behind to
take a vacation in Los Angeles.

98
00:03:33,054 --> 00:03:35,0
Well, where else would I go?

99
00:03:36,088 --> 00:03:38,4
You don't seem too bothered

100
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:40,3
by my being
the Prince of Darkness.

101
00:03:40,059 --> 00:03:43,1
I'm willing to work
within your metaphor.

102
00:03:43,034 --> 00:03:44,8
Right.

103
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,8
Sometimes it's easier
to make intimate issues

104
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,3
about something
bigger than yourself.

105
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,5
Well, there are few things
bigger than myself.

106
00:03:51,073 --> 00:03:53,8
I'm well aware.

107
00:03:54,006 --> 00:03:54,9
(chuckles)

108
00:03:55,011 --> 00:03:57,4
(sighs):
Ah.

109
00:03:57,061 --> 00:04:01,7
Last we spoke, you were bothered
about feelings of humanity.

110
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:04,2
I was, yes, but I have good news
for you on that front.

111
00:04:04,045 --> 00:04:05,2
I'm healed.

112
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:06,8
Is that so?

113
00:04:07,004 --> 00:04:08,9
Yes. Yes, back to my normal,
devilish self.

114
00:04:09,012 --> 00:04:10,5
No pesky empathy to be found.

115
00:04:10,071 --> 00:04:11,8
I'd kick a puppy

116
00:04:12,008 --> 00:04:13,3
if one waltzed by.

117
00:04:13,054 --> 00:04:15,3
I'm joking.
Puppies don't waltz.

118
00:04:15,059 --> 00:04:18,0
You like to hide insecurity
in humor,

119
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:19,6
don't you?

120
00:04:19,084 --> 00:04:20,7
(laughs):
I don't have insecurities.

121
00:04:20,097 --> 00:04:23,0
Mm. Everyone does.

122
00:04:24,072 --> 00:04:27,8
(sighs) Very well.
I'll play your game.

123
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,7
What do you think
I'm insecure about?

124
00:04:29,093 --> 00:04:32,2
That you are changing,

125
00:04:32,044 --> 00:04:34,5
but that you don't know
what's causing the change.

126
00:04:34,077 --> 00:04:36,3
Or who.

127
00:04:38,036 --> 00:04:40,3
We'll pick this up next time.

128
00:04:40,053 --> 00:04:42,2
What? Oh, very well.

129
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:44,9
A deal's a deal.
Though, why do I feel

130
00:04:45,011 --> 00:04:46,9
like you're getting more
out of our bargain than I am?

131
00:04:47,012 --> 00:04:48,0
(gasps)

MAZE:
Courtesy of the owner.

151
00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:29,7
This is from Lucifer?

152
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:32,2
He asked me to make you
something you'd like.

153
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,5
Did I get it wrong?

154
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:36,2
You and Lucifer
seem really close.

155
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:39,5
I followed him
through the gates of Hell.

156
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:41,3
I'll take that as a "yes."

157
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,6
(laughs)

(piano playing gentle melody)

159
00:06:03,015 --> 00:06:05,2
(sighs)
Hello, Detective.

160
00:06:05,049 --> 00:06:07,7
How has your
undercover surveillance

161
00:06:07,091 --> 00:06:09,3
of my activities
gone so far?

162
00:06:09,053 --> 00:06:11,3
I've looked into you.

163
00:06:11,058 --> 00:06:13,8
Your name really is
Lucifer Morningstar.

164
00:06:14,004 --> 00:06:16,7
And as far as I can tell,
you didn't exist five years ago.

165
00:06:16,091 --> 00:06:18,1
On the earthly plane, no.

166
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:21,6
People don't appear
out of thin air.

167
00:06:21,088 --> 00:06:23,4
Who were you?

168
00:06:23,063 --> 00:06:26,5
How did you survive getting shot
six times by Jimmy Barnes?

169
00:06:26,072 --> 00:06:29,6
Is that your normal reaction
to someone saving your life?

170
00:06:29,084 --> 00:06:31,5
- Investigating them?
- When I see something

171
00:06:31,076 --> 00:06:33,6
I can't explain, yeah,
I look for answers.

172
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:35,4
Well, I've given you the answer,
Detective. It's not my fault

173
00:06:35,068 --> 00:06:36,4
you won't accept it.

174
00:06:36,068 --> 00:06:37,4
Do you know what I think?

175
00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:39,3
I stopped trying to guess.

176
00:06:39,056 --> 00:06:41,1
I think you like me.

177
00:06:41,036 --> 00:06:43,9
What part of the look on my face
gives you that impression?

178
00:06:44,011 --> 00:06:45,9
No, no, no, it's not about
the face. It's about the eyes,

179
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:47,8
what's behind them.
I think you see

180
00:06:48,003 --> 00:06:49,8
something that you truly desire,
and you...

181
00:06:50,003 --> 00:06:51,4
you don't know
what to do with yourself,

182
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:54,0
do you?

183
00:06:54,024 --> 00:06:55,8
Really?

184
00:06:56,008 --> 00:06:57,2
Uh-huh.

185
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,5
- (chuckles)
- (laughs)

186
00:06:58,075 --> 00:07:00,5
- Hmm. (laughs)
- That's more like it.

187
00:07:00,075 --> 00:07:02,5
(sighs)

188
00:07:04,088 --> 00:07:07,0
Detective, I never knew
you cared. (chuckles)

189
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,0
Mm.

190
00:07:08,026 --> 00:07:10,2
- Ooh.
- (laughing)

191
00:07:12,022 --> 00:07:13,8
(sighs)

192
00:07:16,006 --> 00:07:17,5
(both sigh)

193
00:07:17,077 --> 00:07:19,3
No bulletproof vest.

194
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,9
What?

195
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,5
I just couldn't imagine
how you'd get it

196
00:07:22,077 --> 00:07:24,2
under that suit,
but I had to check.

197
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:26,2
What is it? What is it?
What is it?

198
00:07:26,044 --> 00:07:27,9
I'm gonna figure out
your secret, Lucifer.

199
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:30,5
Not a secret if I'm
telling you the answer!

200
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:32,7
It's...

201
00:07:32,091 --> 00:07:34,8
Why don't I affect
you, Detective?

202
00:07:35,008 --> 00:07:36,7
What makes you
different?

203
00:07:36,095 --> 00:07:38,7
I guess we both
have our mysteries.

204
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:41,4
Ah. Well, I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

205
00:07:41,062 --> 00:07:42,7
(phone ringing)

206
00:07:42,096 --> 00:07:44,5
Oh, God, not
that again.

207
00:07:44,075 --> 00:07:46,5
Decker.

208
00:07:48,038 --> 00:07:49,5
Are you sure?

209
00:07:49,076 --> 00:07:51,0
Yes.

210
00:07:51,026 --> 00:07:53,1
Yes, um,
please send me the address.

211
00:07:53,034 --> 00:07:55,3
I... I owe you one.

212
00:07:55,047 --> 00:07:57,6
(sighs)
Oh, finally.

213
00:07:57,081 --> 00:07:59,6
Now that affected you.
What was it?

214
00:08:01,002 --> 00:08:02,4
Detective?

215
00:08:03,056 --> 00:08:05,3
Detective?!

216
00:08:08,023 --> 00:08:10,2
(indistinct police radio
chatter, camera clicking)

217
00:08:10,045 --> 00:08:12,2
Come on. Active scene.

218
00:08:18,045 --> 00:08:20,3
The victim was being
followed by a paparazzo.

219
00:08:20,058 --> 00:08:21,7
Tried to lose his tail.

220
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,4
Instead, lost
control of his car.

221
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:24,7
Died on impact.

222
00:08:24,096 --> 00:08:27,1
The paparazzo
following him was...?

223
00:08:27,034 --> 00:08:28,8
Was Nick Hofmeister, yeah.

224
00:08:29,005 --> 00:08:31,9
Who's the victim?

225
00:08:32,018 --> 00:08:33,6
Robbie Russell Jr.

226
00:08:33,084 --> 00:08:36,1
The son of the movie star?

227
00:08:36,035 --> 00:08:38,1
He wasn't
in the business, was he?

228
00:08:38,035 --> 00:08:40,1
Didn't stop everyone from
wanting pictures of him.

229
00:08:40,035 --> 00:08:42,3
They're vultures.

230
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,0
You get a statement from Nick?

231
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,6
You can't be involved
in an active case

232
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,3
until you're off
medical leave.

233
00:08:47,057 --> 00:08:51,1
Listen, I get why you
wanted to be here, I do.

234
00:08:51,032 --> 00:08:53,2
But you have
to bring him?

235
00:08:58,095 --> 00:09:00,2
You've got to be kidding me.

236
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:01,3
What are you doing here?

237
00:09:01,054 --> 00:09:03,8
Oh! How's your ex?

238
00:09:04,008 --> 00:09:06,1
He's not the reason
you rushed over here, is he?

239
00:09:06,038 --> 00:09:07,6
Answer the question.

240
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,3
I'm trying to solve
my mystery, Detective.

241
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:12,1
If I don't affect you,
I'm curious as to what does.

242
00:09:13,063 --> 00:09:15,1
Oh, and I think

243
00:09:15,034 --> 00:09:16,6
I've just found my answer.

244
00:09:16,084 --> 00:09:18,0
Who's that?

245
00:09:18,022 --> 00:09:19,1
He's a paparazzo.

246
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:21,2
Oh. Had a little
run-in with him

247
00:09:21,043 --> 00:09:23,8
during your Hot Tub High School
days, did you? Huh? Is that it?

248
00:09:24,002 --> 00:09:25,8
Yeah, you could say that.
He's a cockroach.

249
00:09:26,002 --> 00:09:28,1
But he'll figure a way
out of this. He always does.

250
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,8
You want to talk
to him, don't you?

251
00:09:30,007 --> 00:09:31,1
Well, go on, then.
What's stopping you?

252
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,1
The rules? Huh?

253
00:09:33,032 --> 00:09:34,4
Detective Douche?

254
00:09:34,061 --> 00:09:36,3
If you desire something,
just take it.

255
00:09:36,057 --> 00:09:38,4
CHLOE: Lucifer,
what are you doing?

256
00:09:38,062 --> 00:09:41,1
Hello.

257
00:09:41,037 --> 00:09:43,2
(grunts, groans)

258
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,2
CHLOE:
You finally did it, Nick.

259
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:47,3
You finally wanted a photo
so bad that you killed someone.

260
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:49,0
You're not gonna
get away with this.

261
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:50,3
I'm gonna make
sure of it.

262
00:09:50,055 --> 00:09:52,4
You're right.

263
00:09:52,067 --> 00:09:53,7
Say that again?
You're right.

264
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,3
I went too far.
I'll confess.

265
00:09:55,051 --> 00:09:57,3
Okay.

266
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:59,7
Maybe he's less cockroach,
more dung beetle?

267
00:09:59,093 --> 00:10:02,0
Police work
always this easy?

268
00:10:02,022 --> 00:10:03,6
No. That's the problem.

269
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:06,0
Right. Well, do you mind
if I give it a whirl?

270
00:10:06,027 --> 00:10:08,1
Tell me, dung beetle,

271
00:10:08,035 --> 00:10:10,6
what is it you desire?

272
00:10:12,073 --> 00:10:16,2
I... would like to confess.

273
00:10:16,045 --> 00:10:18,1
Yes, yes, yes, but why?

274
00:10:18,036 --> 00:10:19,5
Because I deserve it.

275
00:10:19,074 --> 00:10:21,0
I've just done...

276
00:10:21,024 --> 00:10:22,4
(laughs)

277
00:10:22,062 --> 00:10:24,2
...so many terrible things,
you know?

278
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:27,0
I see it as my chance to-to...

279
00:10:27,025 --> 00:10:28,0
Chance to what?

280
00:10:28,025 --> 00:10:29,1
No. I...

281
00:10:30,021 --> 00:10:32,0
I... If I tell you,

282
00:10:32,021 --> 00:10:33,8
- he's just gonna...
No. Just...
- He? Who?

283
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:34,9
Would you please make him stop?

284
00:10:35,017 --> 00:10:36,0
- Who? He who?
- Him.

285
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,6
- Tell him.
- What are you hiding?

286
00:10:37,088 --> 00:10:39,6
- What are you doing? Hey.
- You said "he." Who?

287
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:41,3
Neither one of you are supposed
to be here. Especially you.

288
00:10:41,055 --> 00:10:42,3
(laughs)
Come on.

289
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,0
All right. Temper, temper.

290
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,4
Right. Well, that's done.

(sighs)
No.

292
00:10:51,031 --> 00:10:52,8
If Nick's covering for someone,

293
00:10:53,002 --> 00:10:54,6
that means the real murderer
is still out there.

294
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,4
Yes, plenty of murderers
are out there, Detective.

295
00:10:56,065 --> 00:10:58,9
You heard the man.
He deserves the punishment.

296
00:10:59,011 --> 00:11:00,9
At least he's
getting it.

297
00:11:01,016 --> 00:11:02,7
But that's not enough
for you, is it?

298
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:04,2
You hate that
dung beetle.

299
00:11:04,049 --> 00:11:06,6
Are you really gonna try
and prove his innocence?

300
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:09,5
I'm gonna find out
who really killed this kid.

301
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:11,2
(gasps)
So that's a yes.

302
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:13,1
Wow, aren't you
full of surprises.

You think Nick Hofmeister
is innocent? You?

00:11:39,028 --> 00:11:40,7
He confessed, Dan.

308
00:11:40,095 --> 00:11:42,1
Nick wouldn't confess
to a parking ticket,

309
00:11:42,032 --> 00:11:43,1
let alone a murder.

310
00:11:43,032 --> 00:11:44,7
It just sounded like

311
00:11:44,099 --> 00:11:46,5
- he was covering for someone.
- So wait.

312
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,7
First he confessed, then he
told you he didn't do it?

313
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,4
Well, he didn't want to.

314
00:11:51,067 --> 00:11:54,4
You know, Lucifer, um...
...made him.

315
00:11:54,063 --> 00:11:56,4
Do I even want to
know what that means?

316
00:11:56,063 --> 00:11:57,7
Look, he was about
to tell us more

317
00:11:57,096 --> 00:11:59,0
before you came
and took him away, Dan.

318
00:11:59,026 --> 00:12:00,8
You know what, his
car is at the scene.

319
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:02,5
He confessed.
I know.

Is this the fight
that you want to pick?

321
00:12:04,035 --> 00:12:05,7
Just promise me
you'll look into it.

322
00:12:06,035 --> 00:12:07,6
I'll do my job.

323
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:09,0
Go home.

324
00:12:09,023 --> 00:12:10,6
Okay.

325
00:12:10,085 --> 00:12:11,9
And take your weird
club-owner sidekick with you

326
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:14,0
- before I arrest him.
- For what?

327
00:12:14,023 --> 00:12:16,0
Let's start with smoking
pot at a crime scene.

328
00:12:17,065 --> 00:12:19,6
Uh, sorry, do
you want a hit?

329
00:12:19,082 --> 00:12:21,7
N-No.

330
00:12:21,095 --> 00:12:23,6
It's "puff, puff, pass," not
"puff, puff, stomp angrily."

331
00:12:23,086 --> 00:12:25,1
You brought pot
to a crime scene?

332
00:12:25,037 --> 00:12:26,4
I most certainly did not.

333
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,4
I found it here.

334
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,9
You found it?

335
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,5
You found it here
at a crime scene?

336
00:12:30,071 --> 00:12:31,6
Yes, in the dung beetle's car.

337
00:12:31,087 --> 00:12:33,4
You smoked evidence?

338
00:12:33,067 --> 00:12:35,3
Well, it would've gone
to waste otherwise.

339
00:12:35,058 --> 00:12:36,9
That's really good stuff
you just ground under your heel.

340
00:12:37,017 --> 00:12:40,4
Wow.

341
00:12:40,067 --> 00:12:42,2
Any sign he'd recently lit up?

342
00:12:42,043 --> 00:12:43,5
Well, there was a... a roach
from another joint,

343
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,0
freshly smoked.

344
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,1
Nick's pupils
weren't dilated.

345
00:12:46,035 --> 00:12:47,6
He didn't seem high.

346
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:49,6
Maybe he wasn't alone.
Where's the roach?

347
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:51,1
Well, I added it to my joint.

So our only evidence is
currently in your lungs?

Uh, you really wanted to say
"up in smoke" then, didn't you?

00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:02,0
No. No, I most definitely
did not.

353
00:13:02,024 --> 00:13:03,3
Right, so what should we do now?

354
00:13:03,057 --> 00:13:04,6
I mean, we could
head back to Lux.

00:13:04,082 --> 00:13:05,8
I'm sure there's some stragglers

356
00:13:06,007 --> 00:13:07,7
we could get
into trouble with, huh?

00:13:54,008 --> 00:13:55,7
What?

371
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,0
It's called a devil's
threesome for a reason.

372
00:13:58,029 --> 00:13:59,7
You were once
the brightest of

373
00:13:59,096 --> 00:14:01,7
all of God's
angels, Lucifer.

374
00:14:01,096 --> 00:14:04,0
And now, look at you.

375
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,4
Look, if you've come
to lecture me,

376
00:14:05,063 --> 00:14:06,6
can you just save it for later?

377
00:14:06,088 --> 00:14:08,4
I'm annoyingly sober
right now,

378
00:14:08,064 --> 00:14:10,1
and it takes ages to pour
a drink when you're around.

379
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,4
Actually, I'm here
with an offer.

380
00:14:11,064 --> 00:14:12,4
Really?

381
00:14:12,064 --> 00:14:13,4
Go back to Hell, Lucifer,

382
00:14:13,064 --> 00:14:14,5
and I will speak to Father.

383
00:14:14,077 --> 00:14:15,7
You're scared, aren't you?

384
00:14:15,094 --> 00:14:17,3
That if I don't go back to Hell,

385
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:18,6
you're gonna
have to take over.

386
00:14:18,081 --> 00:14:20,6
Oh, that would never happen.

387
00:14:20,082 --> 00:14:23,1
Oh, no, no, I mean, it's not
like God sent his favorite son

388
00:14:23,032 --> 00:14:24,7
to reign over Hell before,
is it?

389
00:14:24,099 --> 00:14:26,4
Oh, wait, sorry.

390
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:27,7
Forgot.

391
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:29,1
So you can take your ultimatum

392
00:14:29,032 --> 00:14:31,1
and shove it
up your feathered hole.

393
00:14:37,075 --> 00:14:39,5
You can't see it yet, can you?

394
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:41,3
What's that?

395
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:42,8
You saved a human life, Luci.

396
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,4
And not for
any selfish reasons.

397
00:14:45,067 --> 00:14:48,9
No, you did it simply because
you cared about that detective.

398
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,9
(scoffs, laughs)

399
00:14:51,018 --> 00:14:54,9
Your time here on Earth
is affecting you, dear brother.

400
00:14:55,018 --> 00:14:55,8
You're changing.

401
00:14:56,002 --> 00:14:58,1
My life is change.

402
00:14:58,035 --> 00:15:00,6
"The same thing over and over,"
that's your boring motto.

403
00:15:00,086 --> 00:15:03,3
True, but usually you're the one
controlling the change.

404
00:15:05,065 --> 00:15:06,8
This time, you're not.

405
00:15:07,003 --> 00:15:09,2
Now, does that
scare you?

406
00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:11,0
Because it should.

407
00:15:11,024 --> 00:15:14,6
You know, I am tired of
your dire warnings, all right?

408
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:17,6
So just go rattle your saber
in someone else's face.

409
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,3
You think about my offer.

410
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:24,1
When you've made
a decision,

411
00:15:24,038 --> 00:15:25,9
you know how to find me.

412
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,4
♪♪

413
00:15:48,003 --> 00:15:49,7
MAN: Hey, Robbie,
where you been?

414
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,2
If you're gonna follow me,

415
00:15:51,045 --> 00:15:53,0
maybe I can do
something good with this.

416
00:15:53,024 --> 00:15:56,3
This... is the Web site
for the Red Cross.

417
00:15:56,058 --> 00:15:58,7
Give blood, volunteer.

418
00:15:58,091 --> 00:16:00,7
Don't be like
the asshat filming this.

419
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:02,3
Good job, kid.

420
00:16:02,058 --> 00:16:03,5
Better than I did.

421
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,1
TRIXIE: Mommy?
Yeah, baby?

422
00:16:05,038 --> 00:16:07,3
Are you looking at a no-no site?

423
00:16:07,059 --> 00:16:08,8
No. Why would
you think that?

424
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,8
Because you put it away
so fast,

425
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:12,8
and you look
really, really guilty.

426
00:16:13,009 --> 00:16:14,5
No, baby, I'm just
doing police work.

427
00:16:14,072 --> 00:16:16,3
I thought you weren't
supposed to be working.

428
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,5
And I thought you were
supposed to be getting ready

429
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:20,5
to hang out with your dad.
(doorbell rings)

430
00:16:20,077 --> 00:16:22,8
Who is early,
apparently.

431
00:16:25,094 --> 00:16:27,2
Do you really
live here?

432
00:16:27,048 --> 00:16:28,9
I thought I must have gotten
the wrong address.

433
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:31,0
How do you afford
this place?

434
00:16:31,028 --> 00:16:32,5
Do you take bribes?

435
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,0
I don't.
And what are you doing here?

436
00:16:34,028 --> 00:16:35,1
Lucifer!

437
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:37,7
Ah, hello again,
small human.

438
00:16:37,095 --> 00:16:39,0
(chuckles nervously)

439
00:16:39,024 --> 00:16:40,8
Uh, this-this
is yours, yes?

440
00:16:41,008 --> 00:16:43,0
Yeah, that's Molly McDowell.

441
00:16:43,025 --> 00:16:44,4
She's a ballerina by day,

442
00:16:44,063 --> 00:16:46,3
but a ninja chemist by night.

443
00:16:46,054 --> 00:16:47,8
When a simple yes
would've sufficed.

444
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,2
Right, on you go, then.
Go on, fetch away.

445
00:16:49,046 --> 00:16:51,0
(whistles)

446
00:16:51,026 --> 00:16:52,3
Well, go on, then.

447
00:16:52,055 --> 00:16:54,6
Uh, is this too
advanced for her?

448
00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:56,2
You're funny.

449
00:16:56,043 --> 00:16:58,8
Trixie, babe, come on.

450
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,8
Get ready.

451
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:03,2
You need to leave now.

452
00:17:03,048 --> 00:17:05,9
I had no idea that Hot Tub
High School paid so well.

453
00:17:06,015 --> 00:17:08,2
It didn't. And can you
shh on the Hot Tub?

454
00:17:08,048 --> 00:17:09,4
(whispers):
She doesn't know.

455
00:17:09,065 --> 00:17:11,1
What, that her mom
was a giant star?

456
00:17:11,032 --> 00:17:12,6
Why not?

457
00:17:12,082 --> 00:17:14,2
Not 'cause of the old...?
(imitates fanfare)

458
00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:17,0
Yeah. And can you
never do that again?

459
00:17:17,028 --> 00:17:20,0
Right, sorry.
So how do you afford this place?

460
00:17:20,024 --> 00:17:21,5
I don't; it's my mother's.

461
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:23,7
I moved in after Dan
and I separated, okay?

462
00:17:25,025 --> 00:17:26,7
LUCIFER:
Penelope Decker?

463
00:17:26,092 --> 00:17:27,9
Hold on a minute.

464
00:17:28,017 --> 00:17:29,9
Your mother's
Penelope Decker?

465
00:17:30,017 --> 00:17:31,6
- Queen of '80s
cheeseball sci-fi?
- Yeah.

466
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:33,9
(gasps) You have
to introduce me.

467
00:17:34,017 --> 00:17:35,6
Mm, I don't.

468
00:17:35,084 --> 00:17:37,4
And I probably won't.

469
00:17:37,064 --> 00:17:38,8
So you're part of a
family dynasty like me.

470
00:17:39,001 --> 00:17:40,0
No wonder we
get on so well.

471
00:17:40,022 --> 00:17:41,0
How did you rebel?

472
00:17:41,022 --> 00:17:42,6
What do you mean?

473
00:17:42,081 --> 00:17:44,2
Well, you're mad
at the dung beetle.

474
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:46,0
You must have done something
salacious in your youth.

475
00:17:46,027 --> 00:17:48,2
What was it?
Did you kiss a
girl and like it?

476
00:17:48,044 --> 00:17:49,5
I don't want to talk about it.

477
00:17:49,077 --> 00:17:50,8
Oh, so there
is something.

478
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:51,8
Two girls?

479
00:17:52,003 --> 00:17:53,5
- Okay.
- An Eiffel Tower?

480
00:17:55,015 --> 00:17:57,2
What's an Eiffel Tower?

481
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,2
It's marvelous. It's when two
chaps high-five at the top,

482
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:01,7
- then the young lady...
- Okay, there is
an eight-year-old in the room

483
00:18:01,099 --> 00:18:03,0
who doesn't need to hear
about an Eiffel Tower.

484
00:18:03,029 --> 00:18:04,8
What...? What
about the case?

485
00:18:05,004 --> 00:18:07,5
If I were secretly working
on it, having you around

486
00:18:07,071 --> 00:18:09,6
- drawing attention won't
be good, would it?
- Well, maybe not,

487
00:18:09,084 --> 00:18:11,3
but it'd be much more fun,
wouldn't it, Detective,

488
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,4
if we carried on
working together?

489
00:18:12,063 --> 00:18:14,1
Detective?

490
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:17,3
Detective?

491
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:19,0
Mm-hmm.

492
00:18:19,022 --> 00:18:20,6
I understand.

493
00:18:20,089 --> 00:18:22,6
Mm-hmm.

494
00:18:22,089 --> 00:18:24,2
Hello, there.

495
00:18:24,043 --> 00:18:26,3
I'd very much like to
see Nick Hofmeister.

496
00:18:26,056 --> 00:18:28,6
I'm afraid I can't... Oh.

497
00:18:30,031 --> 00:18:31,8
Hello.

498
00:18:32,002 --> 00:18:33,1
Hello to you.

499
00:18:33,036 --> 00:18:34,3
MAN (over phone): Hello?
(chuckles)

500
00:18:34,053 --> 00:18:36,7
(chuckles)

501
00:18:36,099 --> 00:18:38,0
(door opens)

502
00:18:38,024 --> 00:18:40,1
LUCIFER:
Afternoon, dung beetle.

503
00:18:42,053 --> 00:18:43,7
We need to talk.

504
00:18:43,091 --> 00:18:45,3
(chuckles)

505
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:47,9
I, um, I'm not gonna
tell you anything, man.

506
00:18:48,017 --> 00:18:49,9
No, no, no, I don't want
to know about the case,

507
00:18:50,017 --> 00:18:53,1
so you can keep your
dirty little secrets.

508
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:55,4
No, I'd like to know
about Chloe Decker.

509
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:59,2
And you're gonna
tell me everything.

510
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:05,1
I have an effect
on people.

511
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,3
It's a way of
pulling out their

512
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,9
deepest desires,
revealing the truth within.

513
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:11,5
It works on everyone.

514
00:19:11,077 --> 00:19:13,2
Everyone except
for Chloe Decker.

515
00:19:13,044 --> 00:19:14,8
And I suspect it's
somehow related

516
00:19:15,003 --> 00:19:16,9
to my recent bouts
of humanity.

517
00:19:17,019 --> 00:19:18,4
What does this
have to do with me?

518
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,8
Well, you know everything
about her, don't you?

519
00:19:20,003 --> 00:19:21,4
All her sordid secrets.

520
00:19:21,066 --> 00:19:23,2
I'm hoping they'll
help me understand

521
00:19:23,045 --> 00:19:25,7
why she's so frustratingly
immune to my charms.

522
00:19:25,095 --> 00:19:28,0
Chloe doesn't have
any sordid secrets.

523
00:19:28,021 --> 00:19:30,0
(chuckles)

524
00:19:30,021 --> 00:19:32,7
I've seen the hatred in her
eyes when she looks at you.

525
00:19:32,092 --> 00:19:33,9
Come on.

526
00:19:34,017 --> 00:19:35,3
You must have
something.

527
00:19:35,059 --> 00:19:37,3
Do you know what happened
when she was 19?

528
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:39,0
She starred in
Hot Tub High School

529
00:19:39,026 --> 00:19:41,0
and revealed her rather
spectacular assets to the world.

530
00:19:41,018 --> 00:19:43,3
Right.

531
00:19:43,055 --> 00:19:45,6
And two weeks later,
her father died.

532
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:48,6
Oh.

533
00:19:48,089 --> 00:19:50,3
Yeah, so I knew,
of course,

534
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:52,3
everyone in the world
was gonna try to get

535
00:19:52,056 --> 00:19:55,0
a... shot of them
leaving the funeral.

536
00:19:55,023 --> 00:19:58,4
And I really... (chuckles)
I really wanted to be first.

537
00:19:58,061 --> 00:20:00,4
Oh, dung beetle,
tell me you didn't.

538
00:20:00,061 --> 00:20:01,9
Yeah, I crashed
the funeral.

539
00:20:02,011 --> 00:20:05,2
And... she...
oh, she flipped out.

540
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,9
But I got my photo.

541
00:20:07,016 --> 00:20:08,7
Right when
she punched the lens.

542
00:20:08,091 --> 00:20:11,5
I mean, right then-- it cracked
the lens right in half.

543
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:13,6
- I made so much money
off that photo.
- I'm sure.

544
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,2
Yeah, but at what cost
to my soul, right?

545
00:20:20,047 --> 00:20:22,0
(chuckles)

546
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:25,1
And that'll be
for someone else to decide.

547
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,7
(chuckles):
Yeah.

548
00:20:26,093 --> 00:20:28,2
Well, that someone else
is sitting opposite you,

549
00:20:28,047 --> 00:20:29,2
and it's not looking good.

550
00:20:29,047 --> 00:20:30,9
I crossed a line.

551
00:20:31,014 --> 00:20:32,6
And I knew it.

552
00:20:32,081 --> 00:20:34,1
And after that,
I just did everything I could

553
00:20:34,031 --> 00:20:35,7
to keep others from making
the same mistakes I did.

554
00:20:35,094 --> 00:20:37,3
That's why I...

555
00:20:40,065 --> 00:20:41,8
Why what?

556
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:43,4
- No, it's...
- You want to tell me.

557
00:20:43,061 --> 00:20:45,1
- It's nothing.
- Who are you protecting

558
00:20:45,032 --> 00:20:46,6
- from following
in your footsteps?
- I can't.

559
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:49,2
- It's... I just... I can't.
- You want to tell me, don't you?

560
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:51,2
- I really can't.
- You want to tell me.

561
00:20:51,046 --> 00:20:52,4
Who are you protecting?

562
00:20:52,066 --> 00:20:53,5
Who are you
protecting?

563
00:20:53,075 --> 00:20:54,7
How are you doing this, man?

564
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,1
Look at me.

565
00:20:56,034 --> 00:20:57,6
Who are you protecting?

566
00:20:57,084 --> 00:20:59,5
Please, just...

567
00:20:59,071 --> 00:21:00,9
- Look at me. Look at me.
- I won't. I won't.

568
00:21:01,017 --> 00:21:01,9
- I can't.
- Look at me!

569
00:21:02,017 --> 00:21:03,3
Leave me alone!

570
00:21:03,051 --> 00:21:04,3
(door closes)

571
00:21:12,018 --> 00:21:14,9
MAN: I already spoke to the
police about my son Robbie.

572
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:17,8
I don't know what
else there is to say.

573
00:21:18,002 --> 00:21:20,1
I'm just following up.

574
00:21:20,036 --> 00:21:22,5
I want to make sure there aren't
any suspects we overlooked.

575
00:21:22,074 --> 00:21:24,9
But I was told Nick
Hofmeister confessed.

576
00:21:25,016 --> 00:21:26,7
He did.

577
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,6
Mr. Russell,

578
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:32,9
I, um...

579
00:21:33,016 --> 00:21:34,9
I don't think
Nick killed your son.

580
00:21:35,017 --> 00:21:36,9
What?

581
00:21:37,017 --> 00:21:38,6
Are you... Is this a joke?

582
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,8
I'm sorry.

583
00:21:42,071 --> 00:21:45,5
Y-You just don't know

584
00:21:45,076 --> 00:21:48,4
what Robbie went through
because of my work.

585
00:21:48,068 --> 00:21:50,7
Now he's dead because of me.

586
00:21:50,093 --> 00:21:52,5
No.

587
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,9
You know, my mom is
Penelope Decker.

588
00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:57,5
So I was followed by paparazzi
all my life,

589
00:21:57,073 --> 00:21:59,5
just like Robbie.

590
00:21:59,073 --> 00:22:01,6
But, you know,
that wasn't my mom's fault.

591
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:03,9
And you got to know,
it's not your fault either.

592
00:22:04,011 --> 00:22:05,2
The only person you can blame

593
00:22:05,049 --> 00:22:07,0
is whoever ran your son
off the road.

594
00:22:07,028 --> 00:22:09,5
I want to make sure
we get the right guy.

595
00:22:09,074 --> 00:22:12,2
And I'm telling you,
I don't think Nick is him.

596
00:22:14,037 --> 00:22:16,7
There was one other paparazzo.

597
00:22:16,092 --> 00:22:18,2
Did you get a name
or a description?

598
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,7
No, I didn't.

599
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,7
Because Robbie
only noticed him once.

600
00:22:21,096 --> 00:22:24,0
That's why I never
mentioned him before.

601
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:26,4
Thank you.

602
00:22:26,063 --> 00:22:27,8
(phone ringing)

603
00:22:28,001 --> 00:22:29,8
Excuse me.

604
00:22:32,022 --> 00:22:33,2
(sighs)

605
00:22:33,043 --> 00:22:34,8
Decker.

606
00:22:36,098 --> 00:22:38,4
He did what?

607
00:22:47,057 --> 00:22:48,9
What is wrong with you?

608
00:22:49,011 --> 00:22:50,3
(sighs)

609
00:22:50,057 --> 00:22:51,9
Nothing is
wrong with me.

610
00:22:52,012 --> 00:22:54,2
I was hoping for sexy,
salacious details,

611
00:22:54,049 --> 00:22:57,7
and instead I got taken on
a trip down depression lane.

612
00:22:57,096 --> 00:22:59,7
You feel bad

613
00:22:59,092 --> 00:23:01,5
for invading her privacy?

614
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:03,9
You're the Lord of Hell.

615
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:07,7
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but Amenadiel is right.

616
00:23:09,009 --> 00:23:09,9
You are changing.

617
00:23:10,018 --> 00:23:11,2
I don't mind

618
00:23:11,047 --> 00:23:12,6
the odd smart-assed remark,
Maze.

619
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,9
They can be quite amusing.

620
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:15,8
But don't you dare
disrespect me.

621
00:23:16,002 --> 00:23:18,0
Or what?

622
00:23:18,023 --> 00:23:20,0
You'll cry really hard
on my shoulder?

623
00:23:20,027 --> 00:23:22,2
You will not speak to me
this way!

624
00:23:24,044 --> 00:23:26,6
(whispers):
There he is.

625
00:23:28,057 --> 00:23:31,9
CHLOE: How did you get into
Nick's holding cell?

626
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,6
And there he goes.

627
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:35,1
Oh, sorry.

628
00:23:35,037 --> 00:23:38,1
Am I interrupting some
creepy foreplay you two have?

629
00:23:38,033 --> 00:23:40,6
How did you get into
Nick's holding cell?

630
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:42,1
Why, by asking
very nicely, of course.

631
00:23:42,033 --> 00:23:43,9
Something you should
try sometime.

632
00:23:44,017 --> 00:23:46,6
This case has nothing
to do with you.

633
00:23:46,088 --> 00:23:48,1
Why won't you
leave it alone?

634
00:23:48,034 --> 00:23:49,8
Why won't you?

635
00:23:50,005 --> 00:23:51,9
Did you learn something,
at least?

636
00:23:52,018 --> 00:23:55,1
Yes. I did, actually.

637
00:23:55,035 --> 00:23:56,9
Our dung beetle
is protecting

638
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:59,8
someone who's following
in his footsteps.

639
00:24:00,002 --> 00:24:01,3
Protégé, perhaps.

640
00:24:01,052 --> 00:24:03,6
I found out someone else
was following Robbie,

641
00:24:03,086 --> 00:24:04,9
and someone's been
uploading photos online

642
00:24:05,019 --> 00:24:07,3
today from Nick's company.

643
00:24:07,053 --> 00:24:09,1
Last one was posted
an hour ago

644
00:24:09,036 --> 00:24:11,7
from a party
that's still happening.

645
00:24:11,091 --> 00:24:13,4
Our killer could be there.

646
00:24:13,062 --> 00:24:14,8
Right.

647
00:24:15,003 --> 00:24:16,3
Are you coming or what?

648
00:24:16,058 --> 00:24:17,8
Oh, sorry, I thought this was

649
00:24:18,004 --> 00:24:19,2
the part where you
leave me behind

650
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,3
and say something like,
"Lucifer, stay.

651
00:24:20,054 --> 00:24:21,7
Good devil."

652
00:24:21,096 --> 00:24:23,5
I'd rather
keep my eye on you.

653
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,8
♪ Tell me what you like ♪

654
00:24:27,005 --> 00:24:29,5
♪ Tell me
what you like ♪

655
00:24:29,071 --> 00:24:31,6
♪ Tell me what you like ♪

656
00:24:31,084 --> 00:24:33,1

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,1
(paparazzi clamoring,
cameras clicking)

658
00:24:40,048 --> 00:24:43,3
LUCIFER:
So how do you plan on catching
our murderous protégé anyway?

659
00:24:43,052 --> 00:24:45,6
Well, I was thinking,
what if he never left

660
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:47,1
the scene of the crime?

661
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,0
What, and instead blended in
with the other paparazzi

662
00:24:49,023 --> 00:24:50,1
taking photos?

663
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,3
That's quite clever.

664
00:24:51,057 --> 00:24:53,4
Yeah, so if
we recognize anyone

665
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:55,0
from the crash,
it could be our guy.

666
00:24:55,024 --> 00:24:56,0
Right.

667
00:24:59,037 --> 00:25:00,8
LUCIFER:
Are you okay?

668
00:25:01,008 --> 00:25:02,2
I'm fine.

669
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:03,3
Why?

670
00:25:05,017 --> 00:25:06,9
Oh, Nick told you
what happened, didn't he?

671
00:25:07,013 --> 00:25:08,5
He did.

672
00:25:08,075 --> 00:25:11,2
Got to hear all about
your wicked right hook.

673
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:12,8
Oh, yeah.

674
00:25:13,001 --> 00:25:14,9
He also told me
it was a low point for him.

675
00:25:15,018 --> 00:25:16,6
Which I believe, actually.

676
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,1
Yeah, I think our dung
beetle, of all things,

677
00:25:19,035 --> 00:25:22,1
desires redemption for
what he did to you.

678
00:25:22,035 --> 00:25:24,3
Yeah, well, he's not
going about it the right way,

679
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,4
that's for sure.

680
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,0
Yes, well, we all know

681
00:25:27,027 --> 00:25:29,1
what the road to Hell
is paved with, don't we?

682
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,6
Hello, hello, hello.

683
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:34,4
There's a familiar face.

684
00:25:34,061 --> 00:25:36,9
CHLOE: Yeah, from the
crime scene this morning.

685
00:25:38,007 --> 00:25:39,5
I remember him.

686
00:25:39,074 --> 00:25:40,5
And he's spectacularly
creepy as well,

687
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:42,0
so that's a bonus.

688
00:25:42,025 --> 00:25:43,0
Hey, everybody,
it's Chloe Decker!

689
00:25:43,021 --> 00:25:44,5
Penelope Decker's daughter!

690
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:45,9
(paparazzi clamoring)

691
00:25:46,012 --> 00:25:47,0
Chloe, look over here!
CHLOE: Guys...

692
00:25:47,021 --> 00:25:48,8
- Back off.
- Chloe Decker!

693
00:25:49,004 --> 00:25:50,3
- Hey, show me your boobs!
- Hey, show us your boobs, Chloe!

694
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:52,3
Back off,
you mouth-breathing scaven...!

695
00:25:53,047 --> 00:25:54,3
Well, go on then, punch him!

696
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:55,4
Come on, let's punch them all!

697
00:25:55,068 --> 00:25:57,5
It's not me anymore.

698
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:01,2
Well, it's still very much me.

699
00:26:01,047 --> 00:26:02,9
You, Friar Tuck,

700
00:26:03,018 --> 00:26:05,9
tell me, is this depravity
really all you want out of life?

701
00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:07,4
Hmm?

702
00:26:08,094 --> 00:26:11,6
I want to win a Pulitzer
for photography.

703
00:26:11,086 --> 00:26:12,8
Pulitzer?

704
00:26:13,003 --> 00:26:15,2
Really?
Do you hear that, chaps?

705
00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:17,0
Yeah, they don't give out
Pulitzers for nip slips.

706
00:26:19,032 --> 00:26:20,8
(paparazzi clamoring,
cameras clicking)

707
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:28,6
(tires screeching)

708
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:33,6
- (sighs)
- He's gone.

709
00:26:39,034 --> 00:26:40,6
(Chloe sighs)

710
00:26:40,089 --> 00:26:42,3
(whispers):
Oh, boy.

711
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,1
It's not that bad, is it?

712
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:46,9
Trixie's classmates
all have the Internet.

713
00:26:47,019 --> 00:26:49,1
One of them's gonna
figure out that her mom is

714
00:26:49,031 --> 00:26:51,1
the top story on their
favorite gossip site.

715
00:26:51,031 --> 00:26:53,6
She's finally gonna find out
about Hot Tub High School.

716
00:26:53,086 --> 00:26:55,6
Great.

717
00:26:55,082 --> 00:26:57,2
If it's any consolation,
you look really good in it.

718
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,9
Thanks.

719
00:26:59,016 --> 00:27:00,7
Why do I feel like
you're cheering me up

720
00:27:00,095 --> 00:27:01,9
for even worse news?

721
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,9
Nick's sticking to his story.

722
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,5
It's an open-
and-shut case,

723
00:27:05,075 --> 00:27:07,8
but I can't help it
if a rogue detective

724
00:27:08,008 --> 00:27:09,9
won't leave well
enough alone.

725
00:27:12,071 --> 00:27:14,2
Oh, you ran the plate number
I gave you.

726
00:27:14,042 --> 00:27:15,9
Yes, ma'am, I did.

727
00:27:16,013 --> 00:27:17,6
It was registered to Nick--
one of his company cars.

728
00:27:17,084 --> 00:27:19,0
Like the one
that ran Robbie off the road?

729
00:27:19,022 --> 00:27:20,0
Exactly.

730
00:27:20,026 --> 00:27:21,8
Did a little
more digging.

731
00:27:22,005 --> 00:27:23,8
Guy's name is Josh Bryant.
He freelances for Nick.

732
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,3
Thanks.

733
00:27:27,064 --> 00:27:29,5
Why are you doing this?

734
00:27:29,073 --> 00:27:31,4
Because I think
you're onto something.

735
00:27:31,061 --> 00:27:34,4
So go figure it out while
I buy you some time.

736
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:37,6
And... be careful.

737
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:39,8
All right?

738
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:47,0
(camera clicking)

739
00:27:54,054 --> 00:27:57,2
Oh, sorry. Did I ruin
your creepy little moment?

740
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:02,5
I am so happy to see you.

741
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,6
I felt so bad
about what happened.

742
00:28:04,089 --> 00:28:06,1
I'm a huge fan.

743
00:28:06,031 --> 00:28:07,2
Hot Tub High School

744
00:28:07,047 --> 00:28:08,7
was my favorite growing up.

745
00:28:08,098 --> 00:28:10,5
LUCIFER: Yes, we're really
not interested

746
00:28:10,077 --> 00:28:11,9
in your formative
spank bank years, all right?

747
00:28:12,015 --> 00:28:13,9
JOSH: I'm so sorry
about what happened.

748
00:28:14,019 --> 00:28:16,0
I would've done something,
but I'm not good with violence.

749
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,5
(chuckles)
Mm.

750
00:28:17,073 --> 00:28:18,9
Well, lucky for us,
we found you anyhow.

751
00:28:19,015 --> 00:28:20,9
You were looking for me? Why?

752
00:28:21,015 --> 00:28:23,7
Because she wants justice
for Robbie Russell Jr.

753
00:28:23,095 --> 00:28:25,3
What is it you want, Josh?

754
00:28:25,058 --> 00:28:27,7
Hmm?

755
00:28:27,091 --> 00:28:29,8
To be first.

756
00:28:30,004 --> 00:28:31,3
To always be first.

757
00:28:31,058 --> 00:28:32,7
Really?

758
00:28:35,009 --> 00:28:35,9
What, did Nick teach you that?

759
00:28:36,013 --> 00:28:37,5
To be first?

760
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,6
Yeah. I learned a lot
working for him.

761
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:40,9
He's my idol.

762
00:28:41,013 --> 00:28:42,6
He's the best pap out there.

763
00:28:42,084 --> 00:28:44,9
So you took photos of your idol
being arrested for murder?

764
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:47,7
I didn't know what else to do.

765
00:28:47,093 --> 00:28:49,0
Other than
what Nick would've done.

766
00:28:49,022 --> 00:28:50,4
Which is to be first,
no matter what.

767
00:28:50,068 --> 00:28:51,6
Of course.

768
00:28:51,081 --> 00:28:53,9
Just a second.

769
00:28:59,011 --> 00:29:00,3
(camera clicks)

770
00:29:03,011 --> 00:29:05,1
You like smoking pot, Josh?

771
00:29:05,037 --> 00:29:07,1
It's for my nerves.
I have a prescription.

772
00:29:09,029 --> 00:29:10,5
(camera clicking)

773
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,5
Oh!

774
00:29:11,071 --> 00:29:12,5
Hello.

775
00:29:12,075 --> 00:29:14,0
(camera clicking)

776
00:29:15,096 --> 00:29:17,0
Good timing on that photo.

777
00:29:17,025 --> 00:29:19,3
Just lucky I guess.

778
00:29:21,046 --> 00:29:22,3
(engine starts)

779
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:24,3
Far be it for me

780
00:29:24,051 --> 00:29:26,1
to call someone's morality
into question, but...

781
00:29:26,034 --> 00:29:29,0
I believe that
photo was planned.

782
00:29:29,022 --> 00:29:31,6
Yeah.

783
00:29:31,089 --> 00:29:34,3
Makes me wonder
what else was.

784
00:29:36,048 --> 00:29:38,3
Look at this.

785
00:29:38,052 --> 00:29:39,8
Celebrity
shouting matches,

786
00:29:40,002 --> 00:29:41,2
fistfights.

787
00:29:41,044 --> 00:29:42,7
Josh had the first photo
on every one.

788
00:29:42,094 --> 00:29:44,1
It escalates.

789
00:29:44,036 --> 00:29:46,3
Overdose. Suicide.

790
00:29:46,053 --> 00:29:48,1
- Or so it appeared.
- Well, I suppose

791
00:29:48,032 --> 00:29:50,1
the best way to be first is
to know it'll happen beforehand.

792
00:29:50,033 --> 00:29:53,2
So he follows Robbie, intent on
running him off the road,

793
00:29:53,046 --> 00:29:56,4
but doesn't count on his own car
running off as well.

794
00:29:56,062 --> 00:29:58,3
This is cold,
premeditated murder.

795
00:29:58,054 --> 00:30:00,0
- Mm.
- Nick's a slimeball.

796
00:30:00,021 --> 00:30:02,1
I just... I don't think
he'd go this far.

797
00:30:02,034 --> 00:30:04,5
Which means Josh maybe
convinced him to take the fall.

798
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,7
The question is: why?

799
00:30:05,093 --> 00:30:07,3
Well, who cares?

800
00:30:07,051 --> 00:30:09,3
We know Josh is guilty.
Let's punish him.

801
00:30:09,051 --> 00:30:11,8
Ah, I could add an ironic twist,
like I used to when I ran Hell.

802
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,6
Yeah, no,
it doesn't work that way,

803
00:30:13,089 --> 00:30:14,8
because I need evidence.

804
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:16,8
LUCIFER:
Well, you have plenty.

805
00:30:17,006 --> 00:30:18,1
Circumstantial.

806
00:30:18,031 --> 00:30:19,4
I need concrete proof.
(sighs)

807
00:30:19,065 --> 00:30:20,6
I'm gonna talk
to Nick...

808
00:30:20,082 --> 00:30:22,1
Boring, boring,
boring, boring!

809
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,4
You don't decide who
gets punished and how.

810
00:30:24,061 --> 00:30:25,7
That's exactly what I do.

811
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:27,2
No, no, you don't.

812
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:29,2
This is how it
works, Lucifer.

813
00:30:34,025 --> 00:30:37,0
(sighs)

814
00:30:37,025 --> 00:30:39,1
Whatever speech
you have brewing, Maze,

815
00:30:39,033 --> 00:30:41,8
I don't want to hear it.

816
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,6
I think I've said
everything I need to.

817
00:30:47,084 --> 00:30:49,1
You're right.

818
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,3
And I agree.

819
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,5
Let's go deliver
some punishment.

820
00:30:52,072 --> 00:30:53,5
(chuckles)

821
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:00,5
We believe Josh may be
a very disturbed individual.

822
00:31:00,073 --> 00:31:02,2
(sighs)

823
00:31:02,044 --> 00:31:04,6
God.

824
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:06,2
He caused all these?

825
00:31:06,049 --> 00:31:08,1
Yeah. All of them.

826
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,7
I can't believe it. I...

827
00:31:10,095 --> 00:31:13,2
Tell me what really
happened, Nick.

828
00:31:13,041 --> 00:31:15,6
(sighs)

829
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:19,2
I took Josh in
when he was 16.

830
00:31:19,042 --> 00:31:20,5
He was a runaway.

831
00:31:20,075 --> 00:31:23,7
He was a little broken.

832
00:31:23,096 --> 00:31:29,2
In him, I saw a little bit
of who I used to be.

833
00:31:29,047 --> 00:31:32,4
At least, I thought I did.

834
00:31:32,064 --> 00:31:34,2
So I took him under my wing.

835
00:31:34,047 --> 00:31:36,7
He was a natural.

836
00:31:36,098 --> 00:31:39,2
Taught him about all the lines
a pap can't cross.

837
00:31:39,048 --> 00:31:42,0
You know, 'cause I just...
I just wanted him to stop

838
00:31:42,023 --> 00:31:44,4
making the same mistakes
I did.

839
00:31:44,065 --> 00:31:45,4
Mm.

840
00:31:45,065 --> 00:31:47,4
And then, two days ago,

841
00:31:47,065 --> 00:31:50,0
he calls me up, says he's been
in a really bad accident,

842
00:31:50,024 --> 00:31:51,9
and said that
he totally understood

843
00:31:52,016 --> 00:31:54,3
everything I was saying now.

844
00:31:54,053 --> 00:31:56,2
But it was too late.

845
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:58,2
You know, someone was dead.

846
00:31:58,045 --> 00:32:00,0
So you took the fall,

847
00:32:00,025 --> 00:32:02,9
hoping that Josh would get
a chance at a new life.

848
00:32:03,017 --> 00:32:04,7
Yeah.

849
00:32:04,092 --> 00:32:06,1
Nick Hofmeister finally tries to

850
00:32:06,038 --> 00:32:07,8
do something good with his life,

851
00:32:08,001 --> 00:32:10,2
and he gets played.

852
00:32:10,043 --> 00:32:12,4
You must really be
enjoying this.

853
00:32:12,064 --> 00:32:14,6
I'm really not.

854
00:32:14,089 --> 00:32:17,7
Believe it or not,
I forgive you.

855
00:32:17,097 --> 00:32:20,2
This isn't about you,
this isn't about me.

856
00:32:20,048 --> 00:32:22,0
This is about
Robbie Russell.

857
00:32:22,027 --> 00:32:24,9
You know, he was a kid who
didn't ask to be famous.

858
00:32:25,011 --> 00:32:27,3
He just wanted to
live a normal life.

859
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:32,2
Nick, if you don't testify,
Josh will do this again.

860
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,5
He'll do it again.

861
00:32:35,074 --> 00:32:37,9
(phone ringing)

862
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,5
Excuse me.

863
00:32:40,075 --> 00:32:42,3
Oh. Just a second.

864
00:32:44,033 --> 00:32:45,4
Hey, Dan,
this better be important.

865
00:32:45,067 --> 00:32:47,1
I think Nick's about to talk.

866
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:48,5
(sighs)

867
00:32:48,071 --> 00:32:51,4
No, I'm not following Josh. Why?

868
00:32:51,067 --> 00:32:53,7
What do you mean he's missing?

869
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:02,2
Desk Sergeant?

870
00:33:02,048 --> 00:33:04,3
Yes, Detective?
Where did Nick Hofmeister go?

871
00:33:04,052 --> 00:33:05,6
Did somebody get him?

872
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:07,3
Why, yes.

873
00:33:07,057 --> 00:33:09,4
It was that tall,
handsome British fella.

874
00:33:09,061 --> 00:33:11,4
Oh, no. I did it, too,

875
00:33:11,069 --> 00:33:13,1
didn't I?
(sighs)

876
00:33:21,004 --> 00:33:22,8
♪♪

877
00:33:35,043 --> 00:33:39,0
Oh, I respect what
you do, dung beetle.

878
00:33:39,026 --> 00:33:40,9
Much as celebrities hate you,

879
00:33:41,018 --> 00:33:44,6
you know, they need you,
keep them in the limelight.

880
00:33:44,081 --> 00:33:47,3
You're a...
a necessarily evil.

881
00:33:47,056 --> 00:33:49,3
Something I understand
all too well.

882
00:33:49,057 --> 00:33:51,7
But the-the trouble is
that you tried to change.

883
00:33:51,094 --> 00:33:52,9
Yeah?

884
00:33:53,011 --> 00:33:55,5
And you failed
spectacularly at it.

885
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:59,5
Because, well,
sometimes we are what we are,

886
00:33:59,074 --> 00:34:01,7
and we should
embrace that.

887
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:06,5
What are we doing
back here exactly?

888
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:08,0
And do you need me to...?

889
00:34:08,025 --> 00:34:09,9
Maze!

890
00:34:10,017 --> 00:34:12,4
Did you bring me my gift?

891
00:34:14,097 --> 00:34:16,8
(grunting)

892
00:34:21,006 --> 00:34:22,0
(muffled panting)

893
00:34:27,027 --> 00:34:29,2
I'll kill you,
you crazy bitch.

894
00:34:30,044 --> 00:34:31,9
Just be polite to the lady.

895
00:34:32,019 --> 00:34:34,0
She isn't your enemy tonight.

896
00:34:36,011 --> 00:34:37,9
What is this?

897
00:34:38,016 --> 00:34:40,4
Right, well, both of you have
committed terrible acts

898
00:34:40,062 --> 00:34:41,7
worthy of punishment.

899
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:42,9
However, you
will not receive

900
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,4
said punishment
when you die.

901
00:34:44,066 --> 00:34:46,4
It's my fault, really. Sorry.

902
00:34:46,066 --> 00:34:48,2
So I'm here to fix that.

903
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:49,9
Right now.

904
00:34:53,076 --> 00:34:55,5
Oh. Amateurs.

905
00:34:55,072 --> 00:34:57,0
All right, very well,
in terms you'll understand.

906
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,6
You both get a gun.

907
00:35:00,085 --> 00:35:03,8
Let's see
who shoots who first.

908
00:35:11,048 --> 00:35:13,0
What's to stop us
from shooting you?

909
00:35:13,023 --> 00:35:15,3
Well, despite the waste
of bullets, let's see.

910
00:35:15,053 --> 00:35:17,4
He's about to rat you out
to the police.

911
00:35:19,032 --> 00:35:20,9
And he tricked you into
taking the fall for a murder

912
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,2
he committed.
(chuckles)

913
00:35:22,049 --> 00:35:23,6
Discuss.

914
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:28,3
You really did it, didn't you?

915
00:35:28,054 --> 00:35:30,0
You killed people.

916
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:34,8
You lost your touch, Nick.

917
00:35:35,005 --> 00:35:37,7
All this talk about
lines we can't cross.

918
00:35:37,092 --> 00:35:39,9
Nowadays, the only way
to be first

919
00:35:40,018 --> 00:35:42,3
is to realize that
there is no line.

920
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,3
And you were almost

921
00:35:44,056 --> 00:35:46,6
begging to take the fall.

922
00:35:46,089 --> 00:35:48,5
That one dramatic gesture.

923
00:35:48,077 --> 00:35:51,3
As if that would erase the fact
that you've been a piece of crap

924
00:35:51,056 --> 00:35:53,3
- for the last 30 years.
- You can't do this.

925
00:35:53,052 --> 00:35:55,4
I treated you
like a son.

926
00:35:56,057 --> 00:35:58,0
(gun clicks)

927
00:35:58,024 --> 00:35:59,5
(laughs)

928
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:00,5
Oh, Maze,

929
00:36:00,078 --> 00:36:02,2
you fiend.

930
00:36:02,041 --> 00:36:04,0
Even I didn't see
that one coming.

931
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:05,6
You really would've killed me.

932
00:36:13,021 --> 00:36:15,1
Nick...
(car approaching)

933
00:36:15,034 --> 00:36:17,5
I made a mistake, okay?
I realize that now.

934
00:36:17,076 --> 00:36:20,0
(car door opens)
And I'm sorry.
CHLOE: Stop!

935
00:36:20,022 --> 00:36:21,0
Don't shoot him!

936
00:36:22,018 --> 00:36:23,3
LUCIFER:
Detective,

937
00:36:23,059 --> 00:36:24,3
you're interrupting
my punishment.

938
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,9
You, don't talk.

939
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:27,4
You're lucky
I figured out your insane,

940
00:36:27,064 --> 00:36:28,6
ironic punishment
before anyone got killed.

941
00:36:28,081 --> 00:36:31,0
Nick, you tried
to do some good,

942
00:36:31,027 --> 00:36:32,9
to help someone.
Don't throw it all away.

943
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:35,0
Nick, embrace
who you really are.

944
00:36:35,023 --> 00:36:36,7
Stop fighting it.
Come on.

945
00:36:36,098 --> 00:36:37,9
Don't listen to him, Nick.
You tried to change.

946
00:36:38,011 --> 00:36:39,1
Yeah.

947
00:36:40,036 --> 00:36:42,0
- And look what happened.
- Yeah.

948
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,7
You screwed up,
but you know what? It's okay.

949
00:36:43,095 --> 00:36:45,1
You tried to change.
That's what's important.

950
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:47,2
Humans.

951
00:36:47,045 --> 00:36:49,8
Fascinating, aren't they?

952
00:36:50,004 --> 00:36:52,0
Do you know,
perhaps they're onto something.

953
00:36:52,029 --> 00:36:54,3
Nick... don't.

954
00:37:09,077 --> 00:37:12,7
I was surprised
to hear from you, Lucifer.

955
00:37:12,098 --> 00:37:15,7
Well, not as surprised as I was.

956
00:37:15,098 --> 00:37:17,9
But I wanted to tell you
you were right.

957
00:37:18,015 --> 00:37:20,4
Hmm. Is that a joke?

958
00:37:20,069 --> 00:37:22,4
(chuckles)
No, I wish it were.

959
00:37:22,065 --> 00:37:25,2
But, no, you were right,
and I was wrong.

960
00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:31,2
So you'll return to Hell?

961
00:37:31,045 --> 00:37:33,1
What? No!

962
00:37:33,033 --> 00:37:35,0
That is absurd.

963
00:37:35,029 --> 00:37:37,1
No, you're right that
I've changed in my time here,

964
00:37:37,038 --> 00:37:39,0
and that I have absolutely
no control over it.

965
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:41,8
And you know what?

966
00:37:45,047 --> 00:37:48,0
That feels positively thrilling.

967
00:37:49,051 --> 00:37:50,8
You asked me here
to tell me that?

968
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:53,1
No, no, no,
I thought

969
00:37:53,031 --> 00:37:54,9
I'd use you to remedy a
situation that I've mishandled,

970
00:37:55,019 --> 00:37:57,6
and annoy you in the process.

971
00:37:57,086 --> 00:37:59,8
Kill two birds with one
prayer sort of thing, hmm?

972
00:38:00,007 --> 00:38:02,6
Luci...

973
00:38:02,082 --> 00:38:04,5
you should've taken the offer.

974
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:07,1
Oh.

975
00:38:08,037 --> 00:38:10,2
(wings flapping)

976
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:16,7
(groans)

977
00:38:17,033 --> 00:38:18,2
(gasps)

978
00:38:22,046 --> 00:38:24,8
You're looking
for someone?

979
00:38:25,001 --> 00:38:26,2
(gasps)

980
00:38:26,047 --> 00:38:29,0
But...

981
00:38:29,026 --> 00:38:30,8
you were just
over there.

982
00:38:31,006 --> 00:38:34,1
That's... that's
impossible.

983
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,4
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

984
00:38:41,065 --> 00:38:43,4
(siren whoops)

985
00:38:52,024 --> 00:38:54,0
Yes?

986
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,9
I saw Nick pull
the trigger.

987
00:38:56,016 --> 00:38:58,8
I heard the gunshot,
but Josh wasn't shot.

988
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,0
Did you put blanks
in the guns? Like...

989
00:39:01,029 --> 00:39:03,8
Was this some staged thing to
get a confession out of Josh?

990
00:39:04,001 --> 00:39:06,5
That's probably more plausible
to you than my angelic brother

991
00:39:06,076 --> 00:39:08,8
slowing time while I pluck
a bullet out of thin air,

992
00:39:09,001 --> 00:39:11,1
isn't it?

993
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:13,6
Even with all that,

994
00:39:13,081 --> 00:39:15,9
you were standing
right in front of me.

995
00:39:16,018 --> 00:39:18,4
I blink, and you're here.

996
00:39:18,069 --> 00:39:20,1
Is there a question there,
Detective?

997
00:39:20,035 --> 00:39:22,3
You... (sighs)

998
00:39:22,052 --> 00:39:24,4
You know exactly
what I'm asking you.

999
00:39:24,069 --> 00:39:26,6
And you know exactly
what I'll answer.

1000
00:39:26,082 --> 00:39:29,6
You know, um...

1001
00:39:29,086 --> 00:39:32,7
it's quite fun,
this police malarkey, isn't it?

1002
00:39:34,066 --> 00:39:36,3
TRIXIE: Are we going
to watch a movie, Mommy?

1003
00:39:36,058 --> 00:39:38,6
CHLOE: No, babe, I just wanted
to talk to you about something.

1004
00:39:38,087 --> 00:39:41,8
So, before I was a cop,

1005
00:39:42,008 --> 00:39:43,6
I was an actress.

1006
00:39:43,088 --> 00:39:45,8
And I was in a movie.

1007
00:39:46,001 --> 00:39:48,8
And... it was this movie.

1008
00:39:49,005 --> 00:39:53,0
In the movie,
I do some very silly things.

1009
00:39:53,022 --> 00:39:55,1
Things that, uh,

1010
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:57,7
maybe some of your friends
might tease you about.

1011
00:39:57,093 --> 00:40:00,8
But it is what it is,

1012
00:40:01,006 --> 00:40:03,3
and-and that's not me
anymore, okay?

1013
00:40:04,073 --> 00:40:06,1
(whispers):
I know.

1014
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,5
Hmm?

1015
00:40:07,078 --> 00:40:09,4
I've seen this
before, Mommy.

1016
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:12,8
You have? Where?

1017
00:40:13,007 --> 00:40:15,8
I have the Internet.

1018
00:40:16,008 --> 00:40:17,3
Oh, right.

1019
00:40:17,058 --> 00:40:20,6
This isn't even in HD.

1020
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:23,2
Mm. Hmm.

1021
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:25,8
Well, what'd you think?

1022
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:28,2
I thought it's hilarious!

1023
00:40:28,046 --> 00:40:30,2
You did?

1024
00:40:30,047 --> 00:40:32,5
My favorite part is when
you ate too much cake,

1025
00:40:32,076 --> 00:40:34,7
and then you puked in
that cute guy's hair.

1026
00:40:34,093 --> 00:40:36,1
(laughs)

1027
00:40:36,039 --> 00:40:38,0
That part is really funny.

1028
00:40:38,022 --> 00:40:42,0
Then you stop, and
we think it's all over.

1029
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:43,0
Yeah.

1030
00:40:43,027 --> 00:40:45,2
But then...

1031
00:40:45,044 --> 00:40:46,8
- Blah! Blah!
- Oh.

1032
00:40:47,002 --> 00:40:49,3
(laughs)

1033
00:40:49,057 --> 00:40:50,5
Sorry, Mommy.

1034
00:40:50,078 --> 00:40:52,0
Didn't mean
to hurt you.

1035
00:40:52,028 --> 00:40:54,4
You didn't hurt me, baby.
I'm fine.

1036
00:40:54,066 --> 00:40:56,7
It's gonna get better soon.

1037
00:40:56,095 --> 00:40:59,7
I hope the guy who hurt you
got in lots of trouble.

1038
00:40:59,091 --> 00:41:02,7
You know,
I should go see him.

1039
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:05,0
So, the Devil did
a good deed today.

1040
00:41:05,025 --> 00:41:06,5
(laughs):
Oh. Hmm.

1041
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,7
- There's no need
to call it that.
- (chuckles)

1042
00:41:08,092 --> 00:41:10,4
I enjoyed
every minute of it.

1043
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:13,6
(laughs)
You know what I mean.

1044
00:41:13,088 --> 00:41:15,8
Mm.

1045
00:41:16,001 --> 00:41:18,8
You know, I'm so very used to
being in control of everything.

1046
00:41:19,001 --> 00:41:22,1
Not knowing what's gonna
come next is...

1047
00:41:22,031 --> 00:41:23,9
Can be scary.

1048
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:26,9
No. No, I'm finding it
quite exhilarating, actually.

1049
00:41:27,019 --> 00:41:28,4
- Hmm.
- (chuckles)

1050
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:30,4
I think you were right,
by the way.

1051
00:41:30,061 --> 00:41:32,1
About what?

1052
00:41:32,036 --> 00:41:36,0
That it may be a "who"
that's changing me.

1053
00:41:36,024 --> 00:41:41,1
But now that begs the question:
what do I do with her?

1054
00:41:41,037 --> 00:41:43,1
WOMAN: I have to warn you,
he's heavily medicated.

1055
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:46,4
I doubt he'll be able to string
two words together right now,

1056
00:41:46,067 --> 00:41:49,2
much less have
a conversation.

1057
00:41:49,042 --> 00:41:51,3
Thanks.

1058
00:41:54,013 --> 00:41:55,8
Hey, Jimmy.

1059
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:59,3
So this is where
you ended up, huh?

1060
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:02,1
I was so wrapped up in recovery,
I forgot to come visit.

1061
00:42:02,035 --> 00:42:04,9
You know, from when you shot me.

1062
00:42:08,061 --> 00:42:09,9
(sighs)

1063
00:42:10,019 --> 00:42:11,6
I have to ask you something,
Jimmy,

1064
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:13,9
about that day.

1065
00:42:19,066 --> 00:42:21,6
What happened to you, Jimmy?

1066
00:42:21,087 --> 00:42:24,0
What happened
with Lucifer?

1067
00:42:26,067 --> 00:42:28,7
Lucifer?

1068
00:42:28,092 --> 00:42:30,8
What happened
when you shot at me?

1069
00:42:31,009 --> 00:42:32,8
- Is he here?!
Tell me he's not here!
- No.

1070
00:42:33,005 --> 00:42:34,5
No, Jimmy, he's not here.
He's not here, Jimmy.

1071
00:42:34,076 --> 00:42:36,3
I know he's here.

1072
00:42:36,051 --> 00:42:37,8
I can't get away.
I can't get away from him!

1073
00:42:39,055 --> 00:42:41,0
Jimmy, you're safe here.

1074
00:42:43,085 --> 00:42:45,1
(crying)
You're safe.

1075
00:42:45,031 --> 00:42:47,3
No, I'm not safe!
None of us are!

1076
00:42:47,056 --> 00:42:49,2
- He's just a man, Jimmy.
- You don't get it, do you?

1077
00:42:49,044 --> 00:42:52,1
He's the Devil!
He's the Devil!

1078
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:53,5
He's the Devil!

1079
00:42:53,073 --> 00:42:56,3
He's the Devil! He's the Devil!
