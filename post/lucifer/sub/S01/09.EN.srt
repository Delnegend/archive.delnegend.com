MALCOLM: I could have told
everyone the truth.

5
00:00:10,034 --> 00:00:11,2
You shot me.

6
00:00:11,042 --> 00:00:12,3
Why didn't you?

7
00:00:12,051 --> 00:00:14,1
'Cause I got big plans for you.

8
00:00:14,034 --> 00:00:15,5
You betrayed me, Maze.

9
00:00:15,076 --> 00:00:17,1
- Lucifer, I...
- I don't want to hear it.

10
00:00:17,035 --> 00:00:18,5
We're done.

00:00:18,072 --> 00:00:19,6

12
00:00:19,089 --> 00:00:20,6
It seems I'm dealing with a bit

13
00:00:20,089 --> 00:00:21,5
of a mortality sitch.

14
00:00:21,077 --> 00:00:23,4
I'm bleeding.

15
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,1
I'm just realizing the gravity
of what you're saying.

16
00:00:25,036 --> 00:00:27,4
That I'm allergic
to lead projectiles?

17
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:28,4
All I have to do

18
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:30,3
is wait for some pitiful thug

19
00:00:30,053 --> 00:00:31,8
to end you.

20
00:00:32,003 --> 00:00:34,4
And right back to Hell you go.

21
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,2
People come to me to ask for
favors, and more often than not,

22
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:37,8
- I'm happy to oblige.
- What do you get?

23
00:00:38,003 --> 00:00:39,0
A devilish I.O.U., if you will.

24
00:00:39,029 --> 00:00:40,2
Who would take a deal like that?

25

Have you ever considered that
all of this excessive partying

78
00:02:26,098 --> 00:02:30,3
may be your attempt
to fill a void?

79
00:02:30,052 --> 00:02:31,3
"Attempt"?

80
00:02:31,056 --> 00:02:33,1

88
00:02:48,021 --> 00:02:49,5
I am never alone.

00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:52,0

- Are they?
- Yes!

You may be surrounded by others,

97
00:03:03,068 --> 00:03:05,9
but do you truly consider
any of those people

98
00:03:06,014 --> 00:03:07,6

00:03:07,085 --> 00:03:10,4

166
00:05:31,008 --> 00:05:32,2

To get dirt on the priest.

keep an eye on you, am I right?

379
00:13:21,063 --> 00:13:22,7
I saw you talking
to Decker.

380
00:13:22,097 --> 00:13:23,8
You want to tell
her, don't you?

381
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:28,5
What, that I'm the one
who shot you?

382
00:13:28,072 --> 00:13:29,5
Why would I do that?

383
00:13:29,072 --> 00:13:31,5
Your conscience.

384
00:13:31,072 --> 00:13:33,5
I know you, Danny Boy.

385
00:13:33,073 --> 00:13:35,5
You forget, this ain't the
first time we've been partners.

386
00:13:35,073 --> 00:13:37,1
I looked the other way
a few times.

387
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,9
- That didn't make us partners.
- Sure, it did.

388
00:13:39,015 --> 00:13:40,9
Yeah, and it ate away at you

389
00:13:41,015 --> 00:13:42,5
until you finally had
enough at Palmetto.

390
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:44,3
DAN:
I didn't have a choice.

391
00:13:44,053 --> 00:13:45,8
MALCOLM: No, I-I understand.
No, I get it, I get it.

392
00:13:46,003 --> 00:13:47,0
No, you were just protecting
that wife of yours.

393
00:13:47,024 --> 00:13:48,9
She saw me, I went for my gun.

394
00:13:49,012 --> 00:13:51,0
Boom. No, you took me out
before I could take her out.

395
00:13:51,024 --> 00:13:52,9
No, no hard feelings.

396
00:13:53,012 --> 00:13:54,5
I understand.

397
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:59,2
But... the minute you
want to come clean,

398
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:02,9
you and I-- we
both go to jail.

399
00:14:03,013 --> 00:14:04,9
Hmm?

400
00:14:05,013 --> 00:14:08,2
I mean, you... you really want
to throw away your marriage?

401
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:11,1
Watch little Trixie grow
up from behind bars?

402
00:14:11,031 --> 00:14:12,5
Think this through, Dan.

403
00:14:12,077 --> 00:14:16,2
With you gone, uh, who's
gonna protect Chloe?

404
00:14:16,044 --> 00:14:19,1
What do you want
from me, Malcolm?

405
00:14:19,031 --> 00:14:20,9
Nothing much.

406
00:14:21,015 --> 00:14:24,1
You're gonna go into evidence
and borrow something for me.

407
00:14:24,032 --> 00:14:25,9

Three hours?

What should
I do, Father?

00:15:29,059 --> 00:15:33,1
Well, my dear, uh, you should
embrace your desires.

430
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,1
Really?

431
00:15:35,026 --> 00:15:38,1
Uh, when I was here earlier,
Father Frank told me

432
00:15:38,035 --> 00:15:40,1
I should be faithful
to my husband.

Well, I don't know why you're
listening to that fool.

434
00:15:42,035 --> 00:15:44,3
I mean, let's be honest,
if you wanted to be faithful,

435
00:15:44,052 --> 00:15:47,3
then you wouldn't be fantasizing
about your limo driver,

436
00:15:47,053 --> 00:15:49,1
- now, would you, eh?
- You're right.

437
00:15:49,036 --> 00:15:50,5
No, no, no, no, no,
don't feel bad.

438
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:52,2
You have those desires
for a reason.

439
00:15:52,045 --> 00:15:53,9
You should act on them.

440
00:15:54,012 --> 00:15:56,1
I mean, you can always come
back here, confess,

441
00:15:56,037 --> 00:15:57,6
and all will be forgiven.

442
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,3
Isn't that how this system
of yours works?

443
00:15:59,054 --> 00:16:02,1

it that way...

Grumpy guardian angel.

453
00:16:34,091 --> 00:16:36,6
Forgotten about
our deal, Malcolm?

454
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:40,0
Because I brought you back from
the dead for a single purpose.

455
00:16:40,025 --> 00:16:43,6
Yeah, about that, I've...
been meaning to ask.

456
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:45,7
Why me?

457
00:16:45,092 --> 00:16:47,2
- Why you?
- Yeah.

458
00:16:47,042 --> 00:16:49,8
I mean, uh, I must be
something special

459
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,4
for you to go
to all that trouble.

460
00:16:51,067 --> 00:16:54,4
Come on, don't flatter yourself.

461
00:16:54,068 --> 00:16:57,4
You're simply in a unique
position to do what I need done.

462
00:16:57,068 --> 00:17:00,4
'Cause I'm a cop.

463
00:17:00,068 --> 00:17:03,1
That, yeah.

464
00:17:03,035 --> 00:17:05,8
Yeah, and because I
know you'll do anything

465
00:17:06,002 --> 00:17:07,7
to avoid going back to Hell.

466
00:17:10,023 --> 00:17:13,4
Now, stop bothering me
with these questions

467
00:17:13,061 --> 00:17:15,2
and just get to the task
I've given you.

468
00:17:15,045 --> 00:17:17,5
Don't you worry
your shiny little head.

469
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:19,5
I'm already on it, all right?

470
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,5
Everything's going
according to plan.

471
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:23,5
Don't keep me waiting.

Mr. Morningstar,
surprised to see you again.

476
00:17:42,043 --> 00:17:44,5
Oh, I wouldn't miss this
for the world.

477
00:17:44,077 --> 00:17:46,6
Father Frank, when was the
last time you saw Lenny Arietta?

478
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:48,4
This morning.

479
00:17:48,069 --> 00:17:50,0
Despite the restraining order.

480
00:17:50,023 --> 00:17:51,4
I answer to a higher authority.

481
00:17:51,061 --> 00:17:52,7
Not today you don't.

482
00:17:54,024 --> 00:17:55,2
What happened when you saw him?

483
00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:56,9
We exchanged words.

484
00:17:57,016 --> 00:17:58,7
Things got a little heated.

485
00:17:58,095 --> 00:17:59,9
What were you fighting about?

486
00:18:00,016 --> 00:18:02,1
That altar boy
of his, of course.

487
00:18:02,033 --> 00:18:04,1
Why were you fighting
over Connor?

488
00:18:04,033 --> 00:18:06,1
Because I'm worried that
Arietta's gonna pull Connor

489
00:18:06,033 --> 00:18:07,4
into his drug ring.

490
00:18:07,062 --> 00:18:08,5
So, what, you give
him a right hook?

491
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:11,8
Sadly, I did.

492
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,9
And then what?
And then I left.

493
00:18:14,017 --> 00:18:15,8
LUCIFER:
Ooh, no, no, no, I think you
skipped a part, didn't you?

494
00:18:16,009 --> 00:18:17,9
You know, the part where
you beat him to death

495
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:18,9
with a baseball bat?

496
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:21,6
He's dead?

497
00:18:21,081 --> 00:18:23,8
Oh, Heavenly Father.

498
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,1
Oh, come on.

499
00:18:25,035 --> 00:18:27,1
How gullible
do you think we are?

500
00:18:27,031 --> 00:18:31,2
I had troubles with the man,
but he didn't deserve to die.

501
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:33,1
And I certainly didn't kill him.

502
00:18:33,032 --> 00:18:34,4
Can you account
for your whereabouts

503
00:18:34,065 --> 00:18:36,3
between 11:30 and 12:00
this morning?

504
00:18:36,053 --> 00:18:38,6
Uh, I was here.

505
00:18:38,086 --> 00:18:40,3
Taking confessions.

506
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:42,8
Mrs. Madison had a lot to say,
took up the whole hour.

507
00:18:43,004 --> 00:18:45,9
By chance, does Mrs. Madison
have a limo driver?

508
00:18:46,012 --> 00:18:48,1
She does.

509
00:18:48,037 --> 00:18:49,6
Damn.

510
00:18:49,088 --> 00:18:51,6
Just spoke to his alibi.

511
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,0
What?

512
00:18:53,021 --> 00:18:54,0
The MILF in confession.

513
00:18:54,021 --> 00:18:55,6
Oh, great.

514
00:18:55,084 --> 00:18:57,3
Yeah, as much as I'm sure
that followed protocol,

515
00:18:57,055 --> 00:18:59,9
I'm still gonna have
to question her myself.

516
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,9
Father, I'm gonna need you

517
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:05,3
to come into the station
for a statement.

518
00:19:07,073 --> 00:19:09,3
Well, maybe the padre has
a twin brother

519
00:19:09,056 --> 00:19:11,4
who also takes confession; that
way he could still be guilty.

520
00:19:11,065 --> 00:19:14,1
Lucifer, seriously,
will you just...
(tires screeching)

521
00:19:15,015 --> 00:19:16,2
Get down!

522
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:34,9
And you wonder why
I don't go to church.

523
00:19:42,009 --> 00:19:43,5
CHLOE: I caught a partial
from the shooter's plate.

524
00:19:43,072 --> 00:19:45,1
Can you run this for me?

525
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,6
- You got it.
- Thank you.

526
00:19:46,081 --> 00:19:48,8
So I spoke to
Father Frank's alibi.

527
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:50,3
Checks out.

528
00:19:50,052 --> 00:19:51,6
He was in confession
with Mrs. Madison

529
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,8
from 11:00 to 12:00.

530
00:19:53,006 --> 00:19:54,1
He's not our guy.

531
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,7
(sighs)
Well, maybe she's lying.

532
00:19:55,094 --> 00:19:57,4
I mean, you know the sort
of people that go to church.

533
00:19:57,061 --> 00:19:59,1
Sinners.
(chuckles)

534
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:02,3
Lab results from the voice
modulator came back empty.

535
00:20:02,053 --> 00:20:04,9
No prints, no DNA.

536
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,6
What, so you think
this shooting

537
00:20:06,087 --> 00:20:09,0
and the youth director's
death are connected?

538
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,3
We know they have at least
one thing in common.

539
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:16,0
Father, you will be relieved
to know that no one was injured.

540
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,0
- Oh, thank God.
- Please don't.

541
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:20,0
You care to tell us
what that was about?

542
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,4
The shooting?

543
00:20:21,063 --> 00:20:23,0
I don't know.

544
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:24,3
(scoffs)

545
00:20:24,055 --> 00:20:25,6
This wasn't
a random attack.

546
00:20:25,089 --> 00:20:28,0
They were
shooting at you.

547
00:20:28,022 --> 00:20:29,3
But you don't
seem surprised.

548
00:20:29,056 --> 00:20:30,7
What aren't you
telling us?

549
00:20:36,061 --> 00:20:38,2
MODULATED VOICE: Keep your nose
out of our business or else.

550
00:20:38,048 --> 00:20:41,2
The voice modulator
from Arietta's office.

551
00:20:41,049 --> 00:20:43,2
You should have gone
to the police with this.

552
00:20:43,045 --> 00:20:46,6
I assumed it was Arietta,
and I'm not afraid of him.

553
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,7
But if it's The Spider...

554
00:20:48,099 --> 00:20:50,5
Spider?

555
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:52,0
I've heard whispers
of another dealer

556
00:20:52,025 --> 00:20:53,2
trying to take over
Arietta's business.

557
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:55,3
People call him "The Spider."

558
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:56,9
Scary, violent reputation.

559
00:20:57,017 --> 00:20:58,5

what your beloved book says?

566

in danger of becoming involved.
