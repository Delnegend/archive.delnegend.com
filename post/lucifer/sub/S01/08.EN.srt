Ooh! How's your ex,
Detective Douche?

3
00:00:05,037 --> 00:00:07,054
Is this the fight that
you want to pick?

4
00:00:07,054 --> 00:00:08,067
You stuck your neck
out on Palmetto.

5
00:00:08,068 --> 00:00:11,044
Look where
that got you.
Okay.

6
00:00:11,045 --> 00:00:13,055
Chloe, you are stabbing hard

7
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:15,071
 at something
 that's just not there.

8
00:00:15,072 --> 00:00:17,015
CHLOE:
 There's got to be
 an explanation

9
00:00:17,015 --> 00:00:18,025
 for what I saw, Dan.

10
00:00:18,025 --> 00:00:19,059
There has to be!

11
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:20,039
DAN:
 Chloe, this could mean

12
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:21,068
 a lot of things.

13
00:00:21,068 --> 00:00:22,097
CHLOE:
 It means a cop knew

14
00:00:22,097 --> 00:00:24,026
 this secret passageway
 existed, Dan.

15
00:00:24,026 --> 00:00:25,072
What is it?
A 999 key.

I was right.

Not exactly.

MAZE: I want
 what's best for Lucifer.

22
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:39,079
AMENADIEL:
 Then give me something

23
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:41,017
that I can use against Lucifer,
 and I'll make

24
00:00:41,018 --> 00:00:42,027
sure you're both back
where you belong.

25
00:00:42,028 --> 00:00:43,054
That's the problem.

26
00:00:43,054 --> 00:00:45,018
 He doesn't
 confide in me anymore.

27
00:00:45,018 --> 00:00:47,035
 But there is someone
 he does talk to.

28
00:00:47,035 --> 00:00:48,028
A doctor.

00:00:48,028 --> 00:00:49,058
Hello there, neighbor.

30
00:00:49,058 --> 00:00:51,082

Hmm, let me guess--
didn't end well?

They got divorced.

And then Richard sent
Dr. Shaw a death threat.

It's been more than a year,
but that kind of anger

Richard's the only one so far.

339
00:11:52,091 --> 00:11:55,025

seem remarkably happy with him.

So why did you two
separate anyway?

362
00:12:48,024 --> 00:12:49,050
(chuckles)

363
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:51,050
(sighs)

364
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:54,007
The job was more important
to him than me and Trixie.

365
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:56,014
But lately something's changed.

366
00:12:56,014 --> 00:12:58,051
He... he makes time for me.

367
00:12:58,051 --> 00:13:00,065
He makes time for us.

368
00:13:00,065 --> 00:13:03,011
He's really putting
in an effort.

369
00:13:03,012 --> 00:13:05,045
Yes, if ever anyone
deserved

370
00:13:05,045 --> 00:13:08,002
a participation trophy,
it's Dan.

371
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:16,039
(phone ringing)

372
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,046
Decker.

373
00:13:19,047 --> 00:13:20,057
LINDA:
Uh, hello, Detective.

374
00:13:20,057 --> 00:13:21,060
It's about Richard.

375
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,063
I wanted to warn you.

376
00:13:22,064 --> 00:13:24,014
He may be unstable.

377
00:13:24,014 --> 00:13:25,064
Possibly dangerous.

378
00:13:25,064 --> 00:13:27,021
I'll handle it,
but thanks.

379
00:13:27,021 --> 00:13:28,044
I don't mean to you.

380
00:13:28,044 --> 00:13:29,091
I mean to himself.

381
00:13:29,091 --> 00:13:31,028
(siren whoops)

382
00:13:31,028 --> 00:13:32,044
(indistinct radio transmission)

383
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:34,065
Yeah, you may be right.

384
00:13:34,065 --> 00:13:36,028
Lucifer?

385
00:13:36,028 --> 00:13:37,092
Oh, my God.

386
00:13:37,092 --> 00:13:39,002
There's another one.

387
00:13:39,002 --> 00:13:40,018
LUCIFER:
Hey, Detective!

388
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,099
You need your roots done!

389
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,010
(crowd chattering)

390
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,003
MAN: What is he doing?

391
00:13:53,003 --> 00:13:54,033
I've made up my mind.

392
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,047
You can't stop me.

393
00:13:56,047 --> 00:13:58,034
What? Oh, no.
I'm not here to stop you.

394
00:13:58,034 --> 00:13:59,094
If you want to jump,
go for it.

395
00:14:01,031 --> 00:14:04,024
Is this some kind
of reverse psychology?

396
00:14:04,024 --> 00:14:05,044
No, quite serious.

397
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:06,048
Go for it.

398
00:14:06,048 --> 00:14:09,031
Okay, here goes.

399
00:14:09,032 --> 00:14:11,032
I do have one question
before you pop off.

400
00:14:11,032 --> 00:14:13,035
You see, I'm trying
to understand jealousy.

401
00:14:13,035 --> 00:14:15,055
It's a new concept to me.

402
00:14:15,056 --> 00:14:18,069
And you, dear Ricky, are the
perfect person to explain it.

403
00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:20,099
What are you talking about--?
Manners, Ricky.

404
00:14:20,099 --> 00:14:21,096
Manners!
(Richard screaming)

405
00:14:21,096 --> 00:14:23,019
We're not done talking yet!

406
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,040
Okay, I'll talk!!

407
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,040
Pull me back up, please!

408
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,050
Are you sure? Yeah?
'Cause I could just--

409
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:31,010
(screams)
Pull me back up!

410
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:33,024
Pull me up, please!

411
00:14:36,044 --> 00:14:37,071
Oh, God.

412
00:14:37,071 --> 00:14:39,085
I'd save your breath
if I were you.

413
00:14:39,085 --> 00:14:41,098
When it comes to this sort
of thing, he's quite judgy.

414
00:14:41,098 --> 00:14:44,062
Right, back to the matter
in hand.

415
00:14:44,062 --> 00:14:47,052
Now, you were so jealous
that you murdered Dr. Shaw.

416
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,005
Can you help me
understand why?

417
00:14:49,006 --> 00:14:51,042
How could you say that?

418
00:14:51,042 --> 00:14:53,042
I was about to jump,
because he's dead.

419
00:14:53,043 --> 00:14:55,006
Don't fib, Rickster.

420
00:14:55,006 --> 00:14:56,026
I know about
your death threats.

421
00:14:56,026 --> 00:14:59,013
(scoffs)
I was in a bad place.

422
00:14:59,013 --> 00:15:00,053
Kara had just dumped me.

423
00:15:00,053 --> 00:15:02,007
I made my threats.

424
00:15:02,007 --> 00:15:03,040
Then I went to his office...

425
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,000
And killed him.

426
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:06,050
And he talked me down.

427
00:15:06,051 --> 00:15:09,004
And afterwards,
he kept seeing me,

428
00:15:09,004 --> 00:15:11,048
even though he knew
I couldn't afford to pay him.

429
00:15:11,048 --> 00:15:14,001
I mean, he'd got me
through my divorce, bankruptcy,

430
00:15:14,001 --> 00:15:15,045
the death of my parrot.

431
00:15:15,045 --> 00:15:17,055
Oh, I've just realized

432
00:15:17,055 --> 00:15:19,025
you're not jealous,
are you?

433
00:15:19,025 --> 00:15:21,002
You're just sad.

434
00:15:21,002 --> 00:15:22,075
Pathetic, really.

435
00:15:22,076 --> 00:15:25,002
(sighs) Well, if you can't
tell me what I need to know,

436
00:15:25,003 --> 00:15:27,003
what good are you?

437
00:15:27,003 --> 00:15:29,033
Aren't you supposed to tell me
that I have a lot to live for?

438
00:15:29,033 --> 00:15:31,001
Well, I wish
I could, Ricky,

439
00:15:31,001 --> 00:15:32,070
but your life sounds
incredibly bleak.

440
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:35,040
Ironically, it seems there's
nowhere to go but up.

441
00:15:37,024 --> 00:15:40,010
(sighs)

442
00:15:40,011 --> 00:15:41,044
You know what? You're right.

443
00:15:41,044 --> 00:15:43,007
Hmm?

444
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:45,058
Maybe the worst is behind me.

445
00:15:45,058 --> 00:15:47,038
Hmm.

446
00:15:47,038 --> 00:15:49,025
I think I'm ready
to go in now.

447
00:15:49,025 --> 00:15:50,072
Well, I wasn't asking,
but, uh,

448
00:15:50,072 --> 00:15:53,012
all right, go on,
quick as you can.

449
00:15:53,012 --> 00:15:55,009
Come on, chop, chop.

450
00:15:55,009 --> 00:15:58,019
(crowd cheering)

451
00:15:58,019 --> 00:15:59,076
CHLOE:
I can't believe you, Lucifer.

452
00:15:59,076 --> 00:16:01,073
LUCIFER:
What? You should be thanking me.

453
00:16:01,073 --> 00:16:05,033
All right, Richard, we confirmed
your alibi with your neighbor.

454
00:16:05,033 --> 00:16:06,073
You're free to go.

455
00:16:06,073 --> 00:16:08,053
How did this happen?

456
00:16:08,054 --> 00:16:10,020
Poor Sandy.

457
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,014
Who's Sandy?

458
00:16:11,014 --> 00:16:13,030
Dr. Shaw's wife, Alexandra.

459
00:16:13,031 --> 00:16:15,061
Her friends all call her Sandy.

460
00:16:15,061 --> 00:16:18,078
Okay, and you're friends
with your therapist's wife?

461
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:21,075
Yes, how open was
his relationship therapy, hmm?

462
00:16:21,075 --> 00:16:24,022
No, it's nothing like that.

463
00:16:24,022 --> 00:16:25,068
That's just
how the Shaws are.

464
00:16:25,069 --> 00:16:28,059
They go above and beyond.

465
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:30,062
I just ran into her
two days ago.

466
00:16:30,062 --> 00:16:32,059
Sandy was planning a surprise

467
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:35,009
for Dr. Shaw and everything.

468
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:37,010
You ran into her two days ago--
are you sure about that?

469
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:38,030
Yeah.

470
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,053
Alexandra told us
she was in Phoenix.

471
00:16:40,053 --> 00:16:41,060
We checked her alibi.

472
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,067
She had plane tickets
to prove it.

473
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:44,010
What was the surprise?

474
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,084
I don't know.

475
00:16:45,084 --> 00:16:47,057
She just asked me not to tell
Dr. Shaw she was in town.

476
00:16:47,057 --> 00:16:49,077
(chuckles): Uh-huh.

477
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:52,034

I thought you asked me

That-that was me.
I felt like

508
00:18:08,062 --> 00:18:11,039
it would be good
to get your input on the case.

509
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,039
CHLOE: That's a good idea,
actually, especially

510
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,066
since our last suspect
almost ended up sidewalk art.

511
00:18:15,066 --> 00:18:18,036
Turns out Mrs. Shaw
flew to Phoenix

512
00:18:18,036 --> 00:18:20,080
but rented a car and drove
back a couple days early.

513
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,073
LUCIFER: So, dear,
sweet Sandy was here

514
00:18:22,074 --> 00:18:24,060
just in time for the murder.

515
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,074
Wait, Alexandra Shaw
goes by "Sandy"?

516
00:18:28,054 --> 00:18:30,031
The doctor had a female patient
who was stalked

517
00:18:30,031 --> 00:18:32,088
by someone
with the initials S.S.

518
00:18:32,088 --> 00:18:34,061
He used initials in his notes?

519
00:18:34,061 --> 00:18:36,021
I found it odd as well.

520
00:18:36,022 --> 00:18:38,082
Why conceal someone's identity
in private notes?

521
00:18:38,082 --> 00:18:41,035
But I thought
it wasn't related, so I--

522
00:18:41,035 --> 00:18:44,092
Unless S.S.
stands for Sandy Shaw.

523
00:18:44,092 --> 00:18:46,036
If she was stalking

524
00:18:46,036 --> 00:18:48,033
one of her husband's
female patients...

525
00:18:48,033 --> 00:18:49,059
Then maybe Dr. Shaw

526
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,063
was engaged in his own

527
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,063
open-relationship therapy.

528
00:18:52,063 --> 00:18:53,076
CHLOE:
Sandy found out.

529
00:18:53,077 --> 00:18:54,093
So maybe she wasn't

530
00:18:54,093 --> 00:18:56,023
okay with it as she claimed.

531
00:18:56,024 --> 00:18:57,070
(phone rings)
Excuse me.

532
00:18:58,071 --> 00:19:00,030
Decker.

533
00:19:00,031 --> 00:19:02,064
Yeah, this is 831.

534
00:19:02,064 --> 00:19:05,084
Oh, yeah, tell him
I'll be there as soon as I can.

535
00:19:05,085 --> 00:19:07,035
Okay, thank you.

536
00:19:08,035 --> 00:19:09,065
That was dispatch.

537
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:11,005
Dan's phone died,

538
00:19:11,005 --> 00:19:12,045
and he wants me to meet him
at my place.

539
00:19:12,045 --> 00:19:13,065
Apparently it's urgent.

540
00:19:13,065 --> 00:19:14,095
Oh, how convenient.

541
00:19:14,095 --> 00:19:16,045
What's next-- he spills
something on his shirt

542
00:19:16,046 --> 00:19:17,059
and he has to take it off?

543
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:20,029
Oh, no, the trousers, too.

544
00:19:20,029 --> 00:19:21,086
What?
What, so that's it?

545
00:19:21,086 --> 00:19:23,049
You just go running
as soon as Dan calls?

546
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:25,011
What about the case?

547
00:19:25,011 --> 00:19:26,073
This could relate
to another case I'm working on.

548
00:19:26,073 --> 00:19:28,057
There's units
looking for Sandy now.

549
00:19:28,057 --> 00:19:30,003
And once they find her,
they'll call me.

550
00:19:30,004 --> 00:19:31,054
Bye.

551
00:19:31,054 --> 00:19:32,057
Bye.

552
00:19:32,057 --> 00:19:34,027
Unbelievable.

553
00:19:34,027 --> 00:19:35,061
You see what I'm dealing
with now, don't you?

554
00:19:35,061 --> 00:19:39,031
I think I do, actually.

555
00:19:39,031 --> 00:19:41,055
It's worse than I realized.

556
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:43,085
Thank you.

557
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:53,042
Hey, Dan.

558
00:19:53,043 --> 00:19:55,029
What did you find out?

559
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,053
Surprise.

560
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,067
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey!
I just wanted to talk.

561
00:20:09,068 --> 00:20:11,044
You act all chummy in public,

562
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:12,081
then you break into my home,

563
00:20:12,081 --> 00:20:14,088
trick me into meeting you
in private?

564
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:17,068
Excuse me if I'm not trusting.

565
00:20:17,068 --> 00:20:19,098
Hey, I'm not armed.

566
00:20:19,099 --> 00:20:22,032
All right? Hey.

567
00:20:23,066 --> 00:20:26,006
Huh? It's nothing like that.

568
00:20:27,069 --> 00:20:29,056
All right.

569
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,073
Then talk.

570
00:20:32,073 --> 00:20:34,070
I had to meet with you
where no one else could hear.

571
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:36,037
Hear what-- my screams?

572
00:20:36,037 --> 00:20:37,044
(chuckles)

573
00:20:37,044 --> 00:20:40,057
Decker, we're on the same side.

574
00:20:40,057 --> 00:20:42,011
And I know you're still
looking into Palmetto.

575
00:20:42,011 --> 00:20:44,034
Well, guess what? So am I.

576
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,098
I put that to bed
a long time ago.

577
00:20:45,098 --> 00:20:47,075
That the best you got?

578
00:20:47,075 --> 00:20:50,078
God, you're a decent cop,
but you are a terrible liar.

579
00:20:50,078 --> 00:20:52,098
Come on!

580
00:20:52,099 --> 00:20:54,045
Palmetto stinks.

581
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:55,072
I should know. I was there.

582
00:20:55,072 --> 00:20:57,059
Mm-hmm.

583
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:59,076
Go ahead, say it.

584
00:20:59,076 --> 00:21:01,059
I look dirty.

585
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:03,086
I saw you meet
with Nikolas Aoudi.

586
00:21:03,086 --> 00:21:05,063
You were laughing.

587
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:07,047
I saw you hand him cash.

588
00:21:07,047 --> 00:21:09,040
I've used him as a CI before.

589
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,050
I was buying information.

590
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:14,074
Then we both got shot.

591
00:21:14,074 --> 00:21:17,051
And I think it was
a cop who shot me.

592
00:21:19,015 --> 00:21:21,008
But you knew that already,
didn't you?

593
00:21:21,008 --> 00:21:22,061
Why do you think it was a cop?

594
00:21:22,062 --> 00:21:24,012
That's what I was
paying Aoudi for.

595
00:21:24,012 --> 00:21:26,038
Intel on someone crooked
at our station.

596
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:28,042
But I think he or she
got to me first.

597
00:21:28,042 --> 00:21:29,095
That's... (laughs)

598
00:21:29,096 --> 00:21:31,052
that's a great story.

599
00:21:31,052 --> 00:21:32,089
I love the ending.

600
00:21:32,089 --> 00:21:34,076
It-it ties up
all the loose ends.

601
00:21:34,076 --> 00:21:36,009
Not really.

602
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,076
I can't explain

603
00:21:37,076 --> 00:21:40,093
how the crooked cop
knew I was there.

604
00:21:42,017 --> 00:21:44,010
How'd you find me?

605
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,090
I followed the smell.

606
00:21:45,091 --> 00:21:47,041
(chuckling):
You followed the...

607
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:48,067
You know what?

608
00:21:48,067 --> 00:21:50,007
Screw this.

609
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:51,064
I only called you
to try and help.

610
00:21:51,064 --> 00:21:52,058
Really?

611
00:21:52,058 --> 00:21:54,045
Yeah, really.

612
00:21:54,045 --> 00:21:56,085
Listen, Decker,
they pulled the plug on me.

613
00:21:56,085 --> 00:22:00,005
Malcolm...

614
00:22:00,005 --> 00:22:01,069
I was dead.

615
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:04,005
I-I know.

616
00:22:04,006 --> 00:22:08,003
Made me appreciate
the time I've got here.

617
00:22:08,003 --> 00:22:10,009
So, personally, I don't think

618
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:13,080
I'm gonna dig
any deeper on this one.

619
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,080
And I wouldn't
if I were you either.

620
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,054
Not sure if that's a warning
or a threat.

621
00:22:18,054 --> 00:22:21,004
I'm not the enemy, Chloe.

622
00:22:21,004 --> 00:22:23,021
But whoever
we were investigating,

623
00:22:23,021 --> 00:22:25,068
they're still out there.

624
00:22:25,068 --> 00:22:28,081
And they clearly don't have
a problem shooting cops.

625
00:22:32,082 --> 00:22:35,072
(phone ringing)

626
00:22:35,072 --> 00:22:36,085
(door closes)

627
00:22:36,086 --> 00:22:38,066
Decker.

628
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:41,023
CHLOE:
 Unis found Sandy Shaw

629
00:22:41,023 --> 00:22:42,079
in her car in a
parking structure.

630
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,023
Oh, well, I hope our case

631
00:22:44,023 --> 00:22:46,073
didn't ruin
your kissy-time with Dan.

632
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,090
What is with your recent
obsession with my love life?

633
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:50,023
Obsession? (laughs)

634
00:22:50,024 --> 00:22:51,097
That's awfully defensive.

635
00:22:51,097 --> 00:22:54,000
Probably indicates
deeper issues, wouldn't you say?

636
00:22:54,001 --> 00:22:55,001
LINDA:
I agree.

637
00:22:55,001 --> 00:22:58,051
Why are you
so defensive, Lucifer?

638
00:22:58,051 --> 00:22:59,098
Good question.

639
00:22:59,098 --> 00:23:02,058
Et tu, Doctor?

640
00:23:02,058 --> 00:23:04,075
Lucifer, you asked me to
analyze the situation.

641
00:23:04,075 --> 00:23:07,012
No, I asked you to help figure
out what's wrong with her.

642
00:23:08,025 --> 00:23:09,059
Did you now?

643
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:10,062
But...

644
00:23:10,062 --> 00:23:12,072
LINDA: Nothing's
wrong with her.

645
00:23:12,073 --> 00:23:15,019
She's a woman
balancing a lot on her plate,

646
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:18,013
and, as far as I can tell,
doing a fantastic job.

647
00:23:18,013 --> 00:23:19,093
Why, thank you.

648
00:23:19,093 --> 00:23:22,000
You're right, Lucifer,
she's amazing.

649
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,020
No, she's verbal Ebola.

650
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,004
Where's the button
to put the glass up?

651
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:27,014
(scoffs)
This isn't a limo, Lucifer.

652
00:23:27,014 --> 00:23:28,021
And, Dr. Linda,

653
00:23:28,021 --> 00:23:30,014
you should really
join us more often.

654
00:23:30,014 --> 00:23:31,074
(scoffs, sighs)

655
00:23:31,074 --> 00:23:34,014
Getting double-teamed is
usually much more fun than this.

656
00:23:34,015 --> 00:23:35,055
Mm.

657
00:23:35,055 --> 00:23:36,065
Gross.

658
00:23:39,055 --> 00:23:40,085
So you lied to us.

659
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,059
You were in town
the day your husband died.

660
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:45,016
Yes. But it's not
what you think.

661
00:23:45,016 --> 00:23:46,079
Okay, then help
me understand.

662
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:49,056
Sandy, I'm on your side.

663
00:23:49,056 --> 00:23:51,023
Not everything
stems from jealousy,

664
00:23:51,023 --> 00:23:53,063
no matter what
these women tell you.
Hey, Lucifer...

665
00:23:53,063 --> 00:23:56,057
You came here driven by
some kind of desire, didn't you?

666
00:23:56,057 --> 00:23:57,077
No.

667
00:23:57,077 --> 00:23:58,077
Come on.

668
00:23:58,077 --> 00:24:00,077
You can tell me. What was it?

669
00:24:02,028 --> 00:24:03,081
It's disgusting.

670
00:24:03,081 --> 00:24:05,058
Ooh, you naughty girl.

671
00:24:05,058 --> 00:24:07,021
Come on,
now you have to tell me.

672
00:24:07,021 --> 00:24:10,068
It's... in my car.

673
00:24:10,068 --> 00:24:11,068
(door lock chirps)

674
00:24:11,068 --> 00:24:13,095
What is, Sandy?

675
00:24:13,095 --> 00:24:14,079
Poop.

676
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:16,079
Oh.

677
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:18,029
Bags and bags of it.

678
00:24:18,029 --> 00:24:20,032
Oh, my God.

679
00:24:24,016 --> 00:24:26,063
I'm not sure whether to be
horrified or impressed.

680
00:24:26,063 --> 00:24:28,007
My friend owns a horse.

681
00:24:28,007 --> 00:24:31,014
That's oddly comforting to know.

682
00:24:31,014 --> 00:24:33,007
What were you gonna do with it?

683
00:24:33,007 --> 00:24:34,097
I was going to throw it
at Tiffany.

684
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:35,097
That's the patient

685
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:39,011
you were accused of...
Stalking.

686
00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:40,081
Yeah.

687
00:24:40,081 --> 00:24:42,075
She's in a group therapy session
right now

688
00:24:42,075 --> 00:24:44,011
for my husband's clients.

689
00:24:44,012 --> 00:24:45,025
Group cheater therapy.

690
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:47,012
Oh, the imagination runs wild.

691
00:24:47,012 --> 00:24:48,072
So Tiffany was
sleeping with your husband.

692
00:24:48,072 --> 00:24:49,085
She was.

693
00:24:49,086 --> 00:24:51,094
How'd you find out?

694
00:24:51,094 --> 00:24:54,002
My husband's colleague,
Dr. Medina, called me.

695
00:24:54,003 --> 00:24:55,096
Okay, so he told you
that your husband was cheating?

696
00:24:55,096 --> 00:24:57,080
No, he had no idea.

697
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,051
He just called to see

698
00:24:59,051 --> 00:25:01,023
if Bernie wanted to grab
a last-minute drink.

699
00:25:01,023 --> 00:25:04,007
But Bernie was supposed to
already be with Dr. Medina.

700
00:25:04,007 --> 00:25:06,017
That's when I knew
my husband lied to me.

701
00:25:06,017 --> 00:25:07,094
But he was
the cheater therapist.

702
00:25:07,094 --> 00:25:09,064
I don't quite see
the problem here.

703
00:25:09,064 --> 00:25:10,084
(chuckles): I mean,
you said yourself...

704
00:25:10,084 --> 00:25:12,064
The problem is
he fell in love with her.

705
00:25:15,028 --> 00:25:17,031
I lied to him about my trip,

706
00:25:17,032 --> 00:25:21,029
then I drove back from Phoenix
to see what he was doing.

707
00:25:21,029 --> 00:25:22,062
I was...

708
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,065
Don't say it.

709
00:25:23,066 --> 00:25:24,036
...jealous.

710
00:25:24,036 --> 00:25:25,092
Yes, yes, we all get it!

711
00:25:25,093 --> 00:25:27,012
Jealousy makes the world go...

712
00:25:27,013 --> 00:25:28,093
I mean, what are
you, a girl band?

713
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:30,009
I loved him.

714
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:31,010
Oh...

715
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:32,033
(crying):
I didn't kill him.

716
00:25:32,033 --> 00:25:34,033
I just wanted him back.

717
00:25:35,097 --> 00:25:37,064
Oh, great.

718
00:25:37,064 --> 00:25:39,064
The douche-mobile.
Give me a second.

719
00:25:42,088 --> 00:25:44,068
Hey, I got your text. You okay?

720
00:25:44,068 --> 00:25:46,008
Did Malcolm hurt you?

721
00:25:46,008 --> 00:25:47,081
No. I told you, it's-it's fine.

722
00:25:47,081 --> 00:25:50,078
Everything's fine.

723
00:25:50,078 --> 00:25:53,012
I'm gonna punch that son of
a bitch right back into a coma.

724
00:25:53,012 --> 00:25:54,015
Oh, come on.

725
00:25:54,015 --> 00:25:56,012
No. No.

726
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:57,076
Anything back on the 999 key?

727
00:25:57,076 --> 00:25:59,096
I'm sorry, Chloe.

728
00:25:59,096 --> 00:26:01,093
They couldn't get
any prints off of it.

729
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:06,003
Thanks.

730
00:26:06,003 --> 00:26:07,083
DR. LINDA:
So that's Dan, huh?

731
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:09,013
Yes.

732
00:26:09,014 --> 00:26:11,090
Numbingly average,
isn't he?

733
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:13,074
I wouldn't say that.

734
00:26:13,074 --> 00:26:16,094
What... You're supposed to be
on my side, you know.

735
00:26:16,094 --> 00:26:20,021
No. I'm supposed to help you
process your emotions

736
00:26:20,021 --> 00:26:22,015
so you can deal with them
constructively.

737
00:26:22,015 --> 00:26:25,088
Yes, by being on my side
and realizing that I'm right.

738
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:27,018
Lucifer...

739
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:29,085
Is over this conversation.

740
00:26:29,086 --> 00:26:32,059
I'm gonna go and talk

741
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:35,032
to some people who are a little
more open-minded, Doctor.

742
00:26:41,097 --> 00:26:45,010
Hi. I'm Dr. Medina.
Thank you for coming.

743
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:46,090
All right, looks like
we have everyone,

744
00:26:46,091 --> 00:26:48,021
so let's start.

745
00:26:48,021 --> 00:26:49,044
Yes! That's a great idea.

746
00:26:49,044 --> 00:26:52,018
There's so very much
to discuss.

747
00:26:52,018 --> 00:26:54,091
So let's start with the most
important thing, shall we?

748
00:26:54,091 --> 00:26:56,011
Me.

749
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:03,019
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

750
00:27:03,019 --> 00:27:04,019
Thanks.

751
00:27:06,036 --> 00:27:08,076
And once again,

752
00:27:08,076 --> 00:27:10,086
Lucifer disappears.

753
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:14,033
I think the case may have hit
a little too close to home.

754
00:27:14,033 --> 00:27:15,050
Maybe things got
a little too boring

755
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,027
for Mr. Short Attention Span.

756
00:27:17,027 --> 00:27:18,074
I don't know.

757
00:27:18,074 --> 00:27:20,087
He's grown quite a bit
since working with you.

758
00:27:20,087 --> 00:27:23,031
I'm not sure I'm the reason.

759
00:27:23,031 --> 00:27:25,018
I think
you've really helped him.

760
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:27,028
I underestimated you before.
I'm sorry.

761
00:27:27,028 --> 00:27:29,021
Not needed. But thank you.

762
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,098
(chuckles):
And I thought...

763
00:27:30,098 --> 00:27:32,048
I thought you were
sleeping with him.

764
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:34,002
Oh, I am.

765
00:27:34,002 --> 00:27:35,082
Oh. Oh.

766
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:38,082
Is, um... is that...?

767
00:27:38,082 --> 00:27:39,046
Ethical?

768
00:27:39,046 --> 00:27:41,009
Mm-hmm.
No.

769
00:27:41,009 --> 00:27:43,036
No, it is not.

770
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:44,080
(sighs)

771
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,016
But there's
something about him.

772
00:27:47,017 --> 00:27:49,003
I can't stop myself.

773
00:27:49,003 --> 00:27:50,030
(chuckles)

774
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:52,017
(sighs)

775
00:27:52,017 --> 00:27:53,087
But I think it's time I did.

776
00:27:55,037 --> 00:27:57,084
I mean, even I'm
starting to feel...

777
00:28:01,018 --> 00:28:03,095
So do you think
she did it?

778
00:28:03,095 --> 00:28:07,042
CHLOE: Sandy claims she was
sitting outside Tiffany's house,

779
00:28:07,042 --> 00:28:09,035
waiting for Dr. Shaw to show up.

780
00:28:09,036 --> 00:28:11,099
Problem is, no one can
corroborate her alibi.

781
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:14,026
But, no,
I don't think it was her.

782
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:17,043
So there's no one in Dr. Shaw's
files that looked like

783
00:28:17,043 --> 00:28:19,016
a potential suspect?

784
00:28:19,016 --> 00:28:20,090
Not that I can tell,
but maybe I missed something.

785
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:23,007
What?

786
00:28:23,007 --> 00:28:25,024
The cheater therapist turned
out to be terrible at cheating.

787
00:28:25,024 --> 00:28:28,037
Why didn't he tell Dr. Medina he
was using him as a cover story?

788
00:28:28,037 --> 00:28:29,087
Maybe he did.

789
00:28:29,088 --> 00:28:31,088
Maybe he confided in Dr. Medina.

790
00:28:31,088 --> 00:28:33,041
But Mrs. Shaw said
that Dr. Medina

791
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:35,025
had no idea about the affair.

792
00:28:35,025 --> 00:28:36,071
Yeah, so he conveniently
told her

793
00:28:36,072 --> 00:28:38,018
everything she needed to know
to figure it out.

794
00:28:39,052 --> 00:28:41,012
We need to talk to Dr. Medina.

795
00:28:41,012 --> 00:28:43,052
LUCIFER:
 Which brings us to today,

796
00:28:43,052 --> 00:28:46,012
where we find Mrs. Shaw

797
00:28:46,013 --> 00:28:47,096
with a bag of excrement
in her boot.

798
00:28:47,096 --> 00:28:49,016
Sorry, trunk.

799
00:28:49,016 --> 00:28:51,036
And somehow, out of all that,

800
00:28:51,036 --> 00:28:53,033
they've decided
that I'm jealous.

801
00:28:54,053 --> 00:28:56,083
So... what do you think?

802
00:28:56,084 --> 00:28:57,087
Huh?

803
00:28:57,087 --> 00:28:58,057
Yes.

804
00:28:58,057 --> 00:29:00,010
So, wait, you're the Devil?

805
00:29:00,011 --> 00:29:01,031
Yes, yes.

806
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:03,034
Please keep up.
Anyone. You.

807
00:29:03,034 --> 00:29:05,014
When you say you, uh,
burned your wings,

808
00:29:05,014 --> 00:29:06,059
was that a metaphor...?

809
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,005
Not focusing
on the right details!

810
00:29:08,005 --> 00:29:09,098
Uh, yeah.

811
00:29:09,098 --> 00:29:11,032
She was gonna throw poop at me?

812
00:29:11,032 --> 00:29:13,002
God, this isn't
about you, Tiffany.

813
00:29:13,002 --> 00:29:14,015
(laughs):
All right?

814
00:29:14,015 --> 00:29:16,022
Huh, no wonder
you're all in therapy.

815
00:29:16,022 --> 00:29:19,029
All right, this is supposed
to be a grief therapy session

816
00:29:19,029 --> 00:29:21,071
for the patients
of Dr. Shaw.

817
00:29:21,071 --> 00:29:24,013
And everyone here has
a terrible loss to deal with.

818
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:25,078
What, and I don't?

819
00:29:25,078 --> 00:29:27,043
I've lost both my therapist
and my partner.

820
00:29:27,043 --> 00:29:29,020
I'm s...

821
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,023
Th-They died?

822
00:29:30,024 --> 00:29:31,054
No. No, they turned on me.

823
00:29:31,054 --> 00:29:32,064
Some would argue that's worse.

824
00:29:32,064 --> 00:29:34,004
All right, you need to leave.

825
00:29:34,004 --> 00:29:36,047
No, I'm close to something.
I can feel it.

826
00:29:36,048 --> 00:29:38,018
This is not about you!

827
00:29:38,018 --> 00:29:39,051
(groans):
Gah.

828
00:29:41,005 --> 00:29:42,005
You're right.

829
00:29:42,005 --> 00:29:43,035
Yes.

830
00:29:43,035 --> 00:29:45,035
I should use one of you
as a case study.

831
00:29:45,035 --> 00:29:46,052
Thank you for volunteering.

832
00:29:46,052 --> 00:29:48,059
So what...

833
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:51,032
what makes you jealous? Hmm?

834
00:29:51,032 --> 00:29:55,006
What do you desire
that you can't have?

835
00:29:55,006 --> 00:29:56,009
Come on.

836
00:29:57,013 --> 00:29:58,033
I...

837
00:29:58,033 --> 00:29:59,046
Yeah?

838
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,043
I want Sandy.

839
00:30:03,014 --> 00:30:04,094
What?

840
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:07,007
Oh.

841
00:30:07,007 --> 00:30:09,057
I remember you now.

842
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:12,034
Tissue Lad!

843
00:30:12,034 --> 00:30:15,031
Wanted some open relationship
therapy of your own, is that it?

844
00:30:15,031 --> 00:30:17,001
That's not what it is like.

845
00:30:17,002 --> 00:30:18,058
But she didn't want you,
did she?

846
00:30:18,058 --> 00:30:20,052
Sandy loved her husband,

847
00:30:20,052 --> 00:30:23,032
so you killed him, didn't you?

848
00:30:23,032 --> 00:30:24,025
Shut up!

849
00:30:24,026 --> 00:30:25,032
(gasps)
Solved it, haven't I?

850
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:27,006
Eh?! Haven't I?

851
00:30:27,006 --> 00:30:28,049
(patients clamoring)

852
00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:29,049
So that's a yes.

853
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:31,013
MAN:
He's got a knife!

854
00:30:31,013 --> 00:30:33,030
Do you realize what you've done?

855
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:35,030
I had to kill him, all right?

856
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:37,063
He lied to her.
He cheated on her.

857
00:30:37,064 --> 00:30:40,047
And I tried to tip her off,
but no matter what he did,

858
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:41,061
she still loved him.

859
00:30:41,061 --> 00:30:42,094
No, no, not that.

860
00:30:42,094 --> 00:30:45,044
This. Right here.

861
00:30:45,044 --> 00:30:47,095
You've just given me the perfect
example of unbridled jealousy.

862
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:50,028
I'm not jealous. I'm not.

863
00:30:50,028 --> 00:30:52,095
The woman that you loved
was with someone else,

864
00:30:52,095 --> 00:30:55,019
someone you thought
wasn't worthy of her.

865
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:58,029
But no matter what you did...

866
00:30:58,029 --> 00:31:00,069
she never saw you
the way you wanted her to.

867
00:31:00,069 --> 00:31:03,036
That's...

868
00:31:03,036 --> 00:31:04,096
That's pretty accurate.

869
00:31:04,096 --> 00:31:06,070
Yeah.

870
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:08,043
You've just made me
realize something.

871
00:31:10,004 --> 00:31:13,044
That my situation
and yours are...

872
00:31:13,044 --> 00:31:16,014
absolutely nothing alike.

873
00:31:16,014 --> 00:31:18,001
I was right! Not jealous!

874
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,044
CHLOE:
Drop your weapon!

875
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:21,038
(both grunting)

876
00:31:22,028 --> 00:31:24,005
Ow!
Ooh.

877
00:31:26,075 --> 00:31:28,019
(grunts)

878
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:29,055
Did you seriously

879
00:31:29,056 --> 00:31:31,015
just bite me?

880
00:31:31,016 --> 00:31:32,046
(sighs)

881
00:31:32,046 --> 00:31:33,069
He's the killer.

882
00:31:33,069 --> 00:31:35,009
(panting)

883
00:31:35,009 --> 00:31:37,053
Yeah, you think?

884
00:31:37,053 --> 00:31:39,006
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

885
00:31:48,011 --> 00:31:49,017
(engine starts)

886
00:31:58,008 --> 00:31:59,048
So you were right
about Linda.

887
00:31:59,049 --> 00:32:01,022
She helped me figure
out the motive.

888
00:32:01,022 --> 00:32:04,076
And then I realized Jonathan
and Dr. Shaw's offices

889
00:32:04,076 --> 00:32:06,049
shared the same
security system.

890
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,069
So I checked and...

891
00:32:07,069 --> 00:32:10,009
You're not listening
to me, are you?

892
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,043
Afraid not.

893
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:17,010
You didn't see any similarity

894
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:18,070
between yourself and Jonathan?

895
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:21,047
So you heard some of that,
did you?

896
00:32:21,047 --> 00:32:23,014
Tail end.

897
00:32:23,014 --> 00:32:26,038
(sighs)

898
00:32:26,038 --> 00:32:28,051
I don't know.

899
00:32:28,051 --> 00:32:29,055
Did you?

900
00:32:30,058 --> 00:32:33,042
Mm-mm. No.

901
00:32:33,042 --> 00:32:35,012
Completely different.

902
00:32:35,012 --> 00:32:37,082

00:32:40,049 --> 00:32:43,016
So... how's your secret case
with Dan going?

905
00:32:43,016 --> 00:32:44,043
Secretly terrible.

906
00:32:44,043 --> 00:32:45,053
Do you remember Malcolm?

907
00:32:46,057 --> 00:32:47,056
Coma boy?

908
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,080
He woke up.

909
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,027
He claims he's innocent.

910
00:32:53,021 --> 00:32:55,081
Something he said bothers me.

911
00:32:55,081 --> 00:32:57,057
Whoever shot him
knew about Palmetto,

912
00:32:57,058 --> 00:33:00,008
but he says that no one
should have known he was there.

913
00:33:00,008 --> 00:33:02,025
Well, you found him there.

914
00:33:02,025 --> 00:33:04,055
Yeah, I...
He pointed that out, too.

915
00:33:04,055 --> 00:33:07,028
So, whoever followed him
could have done what I did.

916
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:09,009
So how did you track him?

917
00:33:09,009 --> 00:33:11,056
Partners on the force
share GPS locators in their gear

918
00:33:11,056 --> 00:33:13,062
so that they can find each other
in emergencies.

919
00:33:13,063 --> 00:33:16,086
You hacked
his partner's locator.

920
00:33:16,086 --> 00:33:19,010
Which means...

921
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:21,043
Malcolm's partner knew
he was there, too.

922
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:24,084
