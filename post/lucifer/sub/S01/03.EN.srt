00:00:00,091 --> 00:00:03,0
LUCIFER:
Previously on Lucifer...

2
00:00:03,029 --> 00:00:06,0
So you're the Devil,
and you've left Hell behind

3
00:00:06,021 --> 00:00:08,4
to take a vacation
in Los Angeles.

4
00:00:08,063 --> 00:00:09,5
How could you possibly help me?

5
00:00:09,071 --> 00:00:10,8
I have a certain skill set.

6
00:00:11,005 --> 00:00:12,3
I can be very persuasive
with people.

7
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:14,5
I got it; the name,
the whole "Lucifer" thing,

8
00:00:14,076 --> 00:00:16,4
and desire is
like your superpower.

9
00:00:16,068 --> 00:00:18,3
(Lucifer groans)
CHLOE: How did you survive

10
00:00:18,056 --> 00:00:19,9
getting shot six times?

11
00:00:20,014 --> 00:00:21,1
Is that your normal reaction

12
00:00:21,031 --> 00:00:22,5
to someone saving your life?

13
00:00:22,073 --> 00:00:23,5
When I see something
I can't explain,

14
00:00:23,077 --> 00:00:25,1
yeah, I look for answers.

15
00:00:25,031 --> 00:00:26,6
Well, I've given you
the answer, Detective.

16
00:00:26,082 --> 00:00:27,9
It's not my fault
you won't accept it.

17
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:29,0
CHLOE:
What happened with Lucifer?

18
00:00:29,028 --> 00:00:30,4
You don't get it, do you?

19
00:00:30,065 --> 00:00:32,3
He's the Devil! He's the Devil!

20
00:00:32,057 --> 00:00:34,4
LUCIFER: Where's your ex,
Detective Douche?

21
00:00:34,066 --> 00:00:35,4
Hi, Daddy.

22
00:00:35,066 --> 00:00:36,7
Hi, munchkin.

23
00:00:36,091 --> 00:00:37,8
CHLOE: Wow, shocker,
you're late.

24
00:00:38,003 --> 00:00:39,3
Come on, give
me a break.

25
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:40,9
Right, here's the deal.

26
00:00:41,016 --> 00:00:44,0
We can have as much naked
cuddle time as you desire,

27
00:00:44,025 --> 00:00:46,0
but you're gonna have
to listen to me too.

28
00:00:46,029 --> 00:00:47,7
LINDA: You like
to hide insecurity

29
00:00:47,092 --> 00:00:49,1
in humor, don't you?

30
00:00:49,038 --> 00:00:50,2
What do you think
I'm insecure about?

31
00:00:50,042 --> 00:00:52,1
That you are changing,

32
00:00:52,034 --> 00:00:53,7
that you don't know
what's causing the change.

33
00:00:53,097 --> 00:00:55,4
Or who.

34
00:01:08,023 --> 00:01:10,1
(wind whistling)

35
00:01:26,025 --> 00:01:28,0
Go on.

36
00:01:28,029 --> 00:01:30,4
Go ahead, jump.

37
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:34,4
You know you want to.

38
00:01:34,063 --> 00:01:36,4
Hmm?

39
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:39,4
Trust me, it's
a warm welcome.

40
00:01:39,064 --> 00:01:40,7
Won't it hurt?

41
00:01:40,097 --> 00:01:44,1
Oh, there's only
one way to find out.

42
00:01:50,015 --> 00:01:53,6
(cheering, shouting)

43
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,9

44

WOMAN: You're the man

53
00:02:17,051 --> 00:02:18,5
Everyone's here
to see you.

54
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,6
What's the worst
that can happen?

55
00:02:20,089 --> 00:02:22,7
Come on, have one
drink with me.

56
00:02:22,093 --> 00:02:24,5
I can't, I'm sorry, I'm not
trying to be a buzzkill,

57
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:26,2
I'm just... I'm not in the
mood to party, all right?

58
00:02:26,043 --> 00:02:28,4
How can you decline
this ravishing siren's

59
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:30,4
invitation to imbibe?

60
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:33,8
(chuckles) Well, if L.A.'s
taught me anything,

61
00:02:34,003 --> 00:02:36,2
constant rejections
do build character.

62
00:02:36,044 --> 00:02:37,8
LUCIFER: Sincerely doubt
"constant rejection"

63
00:02:38,003 --> 00:02:39,3
is something you
ever deal with.

64
00:02:39,053 --> 00:02:40,8
(chuckles)

65
00:02:41,003 --> 00:02:42,6
You could learn a thing
or two from this guy.

66
00:02:42,087 --> 00:02:44,6
Oh.
(chuckles)

67
00:02:44,087 --> 00:02:46,3
Witty, charming and wise.

68
00:02:46,054 --> 00:02:47,5
Have you lost your mind?

69
00:02:47,071 --> 00:02:49,1
Do I know you?

70
00:02:49,037 --> 00:02:50,4
Lucifer.

71
00:02:50,067 --> 00:02:51,5
Morningstar.

72
00:02:53,029 --> 00:02:54,4
Right, you're the
club owner guy

73
00:02:54,067 --> 00:02:56,0
who grants people favors.

74
00:02:56,026 --> 00:02:58,5
Yeah, I don't need
anything from you.

75
00:02:58,076 --> 00:03:00,6
Oh, I beg
to differ, Ty.

76
00:03:00,089 --> 00:03:02,1
I have been looking
for you all night.

77
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,1
And you are in desperate
need of my help.

78
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:06,8
Star quarterback,
number-one draft pick,

79
00:03:07,002 --> 00:03:09,9
and yet, for some inexplicable
reason, a virgin.

80
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:11,8
Look, man, I got all the haters
I need online, all right?

81
00:03:12,002 --> 00:03:14,1
No, no, no, no, no,
I'm not criticizing.

82
00:03:14,036 --> 00:03:15,6
I'm fascinated.

83
00:03:15,082 --> 00:03:18,0
I mean, do you know
how rare you are?

84
00:03:18,024 --> 00:03:20,3
A celebrity virgin
in Los Angeles,

85
00:03:20,057 --> 00:03:22,0
and surrounded by temptation.

86
00:03:22,024 --> 00:03:24,2
I mean, you, Ty, are like

87
00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:26,5
a four-leaf clover
and a unicorn made a baby.

88
00:03:26,074 --> 00:03:28,9
Without, uh, having
sex, of course.

89
00:03:29,012 --> 00:03:30,7
(wry chuckle)

90
00:03:30,092 --> 00:03:32,1
MAN: Aw, thanks,
I appreciate it.

91
00:03:32,038 --> 00:03:33,3
My agent wanted me
to throw this party.

92
00:03:33,054 --> 00:03:34,8
Oh.

93
00:03:35,004 --> 00:03:37,2
- Yeah, he wants me to loosen up.
- He's right.

94
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:38,8
I've met your type before,

95
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:40,3
so desperate
to control their lives,

96
00:03:40,059 --> 00:03:41,7
they forget to enjoy it.

97
00:03:41,097 --> 00:03:44,0
So answer me this.

98
00:03:44,026 --> 00:03:47,7
If you were to ever,
you know, let go,

99
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:50,3
what is it you'd
really want to do?

100
00:03:50,052 --> 00:03:52,2
I, uh...

101
00:03:52,044 --> 00:03:54,4
Yeah.
I...

102
00:03:54,061 --> 00:03:56,5
I want to skip my morning
workout sometimes.

103
00:03:56,077 --> 00:03:58,8
Boring.
Just chill on the couch

104
00:03:59,007 --> 00:03:59,9
and watch Master Chef.

105
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:01,0
This is the fantasy life

106
00:04:01,024 --> 00:04:02,7
of a postmenopausal housewife.

107
00:04:02,095 --> 00:04:04,9
Come on, Ty, there must
be something deeper.

108
00:04:05,016 --> 00:04:06,5
I, um...

109
00:04:06,078 --> 00:04:08,4
Yeah.

110
00:04:08,058 --> 00:04:10,5
I want to get laid so damn bad.

111
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:12,7
(laughing):
And there it is.

112
00:04:12,092 --> 00:04:16,0
You got no idea how hard it is
holding out for marriage, man.

113
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:17,9
Uncomfortably hard, I'm sure.

114
00:04:18,013 --> 00:04:19,9
(both chuckle)

115
00:04:20,013 --> 00:04:21,5
Look, I was going to
with my girl,

116
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,2
but, uh, we broke up.

117
00:04:23,047 --> 00:04:24,2
Oh...

118
00:04:24,047 --> 00:04:25,2
I thought she was gonna be

119
00:04:25,047 --> 00:04:26,9
the mother of my children.

120
00:04:27,018 --> 00:04:28,6
Well, she wants to be
the mother of your children.

121
00:04:28,081 --> 00:04:30,6
Come on, Ty,
it's the fourth quarter,

122
00:04:30,081 --> 00:04:32,8
but you can still
win this game.

123
00:04:33,002 --> 00:04:34,9
I mean, look at her:
death and taxes

124
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,1
are less of a sure thing.

125
00:04:36,036 --> 00:04:37,4
No, I can't.

126
00:04:37,065 --> 00:04:38,7
But you desire her.

127
00:04:38,098 --> 00:04:40,2
Why fight it?

128
00:04:40,049 --> 00:04:43,0
Because my mother
taught me that...

129
00:04:43,028 --> 00:04:45,1
Oh, no, don't-don't bring her
into this; that's disgusting.

130
00:04:45,028 --> 00:04:48,1
Uh... it's about you.

131
00:04:48,033 --> 00:04:49,4
What do you want?

132
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,9
Her.

133
00:04:52,016 --> 00:04:54,0
Well, then "carpe diem,"
my friend.

134
00:05:01,071 --> 00:05:03,6
Ah, hello again,
my little cannonball.

135
00:05:03,084 --> 00:05:05,6

introduce myself earlier.

00:05:08,055 --> 00:05:10,0
Yes, yes.

139
00:05:10,027 --> 00:05:11,8
I'm the Devil, hope you'll
hold it against me.

140

No, it's not.

I've seen him before.

144
00:05:19,023 --> 00:05:20,3
His beats are sick.

145
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:22,0
I very much beg your pardon.

146
00:05:22,024 --> 00:05:23,0
Beats?

147
00:05:23,024 --> 00:05:24,6
Yeah.

148
00:05:24,082 --> 00:05:26,6
He performed at a rap battle
last week in the Valley.

149
00:05:26,086 --> 00:05:29,7
Every single part of that
sentence horrifies me.

150
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:31,7
It is so gross

151
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,3

Is Lucifer a magician?

That's sort of what
I'm trying to figure out.

I'm not sure if Daddy has
the answers to these questions.

186

Why don't you
just ask Lucifer?

187
00:07:08,076 --> 00:07:11,5
Because if he's a magician, then
he won't reveal his secrets.

00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,6
So I have to find out
on my own how Lucifer does...

189
00:07:14,081 --> 00:07:17,6
(cell phone rings, buzzes)
these things that I can't...

190
00:07:17,081 --> 00:07:19,9
explain.

191
00:07:20,014 --> 00:07:21,7
Oh, that can't be him.

192
00:07:21,098 --> 00:07:23,1
(phone beeps on)

193
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,6
Decker.

194
00:07:24,082 --> 00:07:27,2
Lucifer, how did you
even get this number?

195
00:07:30,011 --> 00:07:31,9
LUCIFER:
Excuse the mess,

196
00:07:32,012 --> 00:07:34,9
but it's so good of you
to come, Detective Decker.

197
00:07:35,016 --> 00:07:38,9
Thanks for being super-cryptic
in a really unhelpful way.

198
00:07:39,016 --> 00:07:40,8
(chuckles)
What's the emergency?

199
00:07:41,008 --> 00:07:42,6
Well, it's-it's better to
show than tell, really.

200
00:07:50,076 --> 00:07:51,6
I...

201
00:07:54,043 --> 00:07:57,3
♪♪

202
00:08:04,027 --> 00:08:06,0
CORONER: Petechial
hemorrhaging in the eyes.

203
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,4
Contusions
on the neck.

204
00:08:07,065 --> 00:08:09,1
Signs of strangulation.

205
00:08:09,032 --> 00:08:11,8
And one of the victim's
fake nails was ripped off.

206
00:08:12,007 --> 00:08:13,2
Signs of struggle.

207
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,9
We got a murder
on our hands.

208
00:08:15,012 --> 00:08:17,2
Thanks.

209
00:08:18,062 --> 00:08:20,4
CHLOE:
So what happened?

210
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:22,7
TY: Um, well, I woke up early,
'cause my head hurt.

211
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,7
I, uh...

212
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,7
I had a hangover.

213
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,4
I... I've never
drank before, so...

214
00:08:27,067 --> 00:08:30,0
That's on me. Sorry.

215
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:31,8
Yeah, so I came down
to get some water,

216
00:08:32,005 --> 00:08:33,3
and that's-that's
when I saw her in the pool.

217
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:34,4
Did you know her?

218
00:08:34,064 --> 00:08:35,9
Not before last night.

219
00:08:36,018 --> 00:08:37,6
I talked to her for
a little bit.

220
00:08:37,085 --> 00:08:39,6
Her name
was, uh...

221
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,5
Ali, maybe?

222
00:08:41,073 --> 00:08:43,9
I don't know. I mean, I'm having
a hard time remembering.

223
00:08:46,065 --> 00:08:48,1
You think she
accidentally slipped,

224
00:08:48,036 --> 00:08:49,6
fell in the pool
and drowned?

225
00:08:49,086 --> 00:08:51,1
No, I think she was murdered.

226
00:08:51,036 --> 00:08:53,1
Oh, my God, that's...
that's terrible.

227
00:08:53,036 --> 00:08:55,9
So why didn't you call
the police right away?

228
00:08:56,012 --> 00:08:57,5
Well, I told Lucifer.

229
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,1
He said... he said that
he would call the police.

230
00:08:59,033 --> 00:09:00,5
LUCIFER:
And I did.

231
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:02,0
Detective Decker's
a homicide detective.

232
00:09:02,021 --> 00:09:03,7
She's been very helpful

233
00:09:03,087 --> 00:09:06,6
in the other murders
that I've encountered.

234
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:09,5
I am not your personal
police concierge.

235
00:09:09,071 --> 00:09:11,1
You are gonna find out
who did this, aren't you?

236
00:09:11,038 --> 00:09:12,7
(inhales)

237
00:09:12,097 --> 00:09:14,4
Of course I am,
because that's my job.

238
00:09:14,068 --> 00:09:15,8
- Right.
- Not because
you want me to.

239
00:09:16,001 --> 00:09:17,4
(scoffs) Right.

240
00:09:17,068 --> 00:09:19,1
First things last:
Do you have any idea

241
00:09:19,035 --> 00:09:20,9
who had contact
with her last night?

242
00:09:21,014 --> 00:09:23,9
Um, no, uh, no, but they asked
me to get the... the guest list.

243
00:09:25,052 --> 00:09:27,5
(quietly):
Oh, geez.

244
00:09:27,077 --> 00:09:28,9
250 guests.

245
00:09:29,011 --> 00:09:29,9
You know what
that means.

246
00:09:30,011 --> 00:09:31,1
Great party.

247
00:09:32,065 --> 00:09:35,1
250 suspects.

248
00:09:36,066 --> 00:09:38,5
Oh. Uh, I'd be careful
with that thing

249
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,1
in the guest bedroom.

250
00:09:40,033 --> 00:09:41,3
There's a good chance
you'll go blind.

251
00:09:41,054 --> 00:09:43,0
Unspeakable acts.

252
00:09:43,025 --> 00:09:45,1
Yes, we got a little
carried away. (chuckles)

253
00:09:45,033 --> 00:09:47,5
Stop interfering.

254
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:48,9
I'm helping.

255
00:09:49,013 --> 00:09:50,6
You forget that
my expertise

256
00:09:50,084 --> 00:09:51,8
is finding the right people
to punish, Detective.

257
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:52,8
It's what I do.

258
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,7
Or, uh, did, at least.

259
00:09:54,092 --> 00:09:56,3
You want to do something?

260
00:09:56,059 --> 00:09:58,3
Then help account for everyone
who was at the party.

261
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:00,0
- Oh.
- Coroner puts
the time of death

262
00:10:00,022 --> 00:10:01,3
between 1:00 and 3:00 a.m.

263
00:10:01,056 --> 00:10:02,9
Actually, is there someone

264
00:10:03,018 --> 00:10:04,5
who can vouch for your
whereabouts at the time?

265
00:10:04,073 --> 00:10:06,4
Several someones, in fact.

266
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:07,8
Yes.

267
00:10:08,006 --> 00:10:09,6
Get them to tell you
every little detail

268
00:10:09,086 --> 00:10:11,3
just to make sure
that I'm not lying.

269
00:10:11,057 --> 00:10:14,5
I'll have someone else
handle that.

270
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:17,7
So... a bona fide killer on the
loose that needs to be punished.

271
00:10:17,095 --> 00:10:18,7
Time to punch in.

272
00:10:18,095 --> 00:10:20,5
There she is.

273
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,9
Do you know anyone here?

274
00:10:23,012 --> 00:10:24,9
No. Sorry.

275
00:10:25,012 --> 00:10:26,9
I mean, people just
show up to these things.

276
00:10:27,012 --> 00:10:28,4
Did anyone look suspicious?

277
00:10:28,067 --> 00:10:30,5
(scoffs) Where do
we start, Detective?

278
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,2
I mean, look at those
big strong hands.

279
00:10:32,042 --> 00:10:33,7
Perfect for squeezing
the life out of someone.

280
00:10:33,096 --> 00:10:36,4
Oh, ginger lad.

281
00:10:36,063 --> 00:10:37,7
Soulless bastards.

282
00:10:37,097 --> 00:10:39,4
Give even me the creeps.

283
00:10:39,064 --> 00:10:40,7
I...

284
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:42,2
You need to sit
with the witnesses.

285
00:10:43,064 --> 00:10:44,7
LUCIFER:
Haven't I proven myself

286
00:10:44,097 --> 00:10:46,5
extremely useful at detectiving?

287
00:10:46,073 --> 00:10:49,1
Actually, no, I don't need
your help color-commentating.

288
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,9
I need facts
and hard evidence.

289
00:10:51,015 --> 00:10:53,5
So unless you can help
me with either, stay.

290
00:10:53,077 --> 00:10:56,2
But I don't want to be stuck
out here with these miscreants.

291
00:10:56,049 --> 00:10:57,7
These are your people.

292
00:10:57,099 --> 00:10:59,7
Detective!

293
00:10:59,099 --> 00:11:02,5
(huffs)

294
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,9
(woman retching, vomiting)

295
00:11:04,016 --> 00:11:06,7
This won't do at all.

296
00:11:13,063 --> 00:11:15,4
Hey.

297
00:11:15,067 --> 00:11:16,8
I heard all hands on deck.

298
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,6
I came as quick as I could.

299
00:11:18,084 --> 00:11:20,0
Yeah, and on time.

300
00:11:21,068 --> 00:11:23,6
Look, Chloe,
I'm sorry about earlier, okay?

301
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,1
I got held up at an arrest
in Hollywood.

302
00:11:25,035 --> 00:11:26,3
I couldn't get away.

303
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,4
I get it, Dan.

304
00:11:27,064 --> 00:11:28,6
Save the apologies for Trixie.

305
00:11:28,085 --> 00:11:30,1
This is work,
and right now,

306
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:32,0
we have a victim
with no fingerprints on file.

307
00:11:32,027 --> 00:11:34,6
These all the unclaimed items
from the party?

308
00:11:34,082 --> 00:11:36,4
Yeah, I checked everything.

309
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:38,9
Unfortunately, no I.D.
that matches our victim.

310
00:11:39,015 --> 00:11:40,3
So, what are you thinking?

311
00:11:40,053 --> 00:11:43,4
Well, I'm thinking our victim

312
00:11:43,066 --> 00:11:45,7
wore a cute red dress.

313
00:11:45,091 --> 00:11:48,4
There's no way she'd have
that pink clutch.

314
00:11:48,066 --> 00:11:50,0
She was out to have fun,

315
00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:52,3
so that nixes anything big
and bulky, like a tote.

316
00:11:52,054 --> 00:11:54,4
I don't know.

317
00:11:54,063 --> 00:11:56,2
I'm looking for
something small,

318
00:11:56,046 --> 00:11:57,4
a little sexy...

319
00:11:57,067 --> 00:11:59,3
classy.

320
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:02,0
Something like this.

321
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:03,5
Wait a minute,
I-I thought you said

322
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,8
all this stuff was
searched already for I.D.

323
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:06,0
I'm not looking for an I.D.

324
00:12:06,022 --> 00:12:07,3
I'm looking for a car.

325
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,8
(car alarm chirps)

326
00:12:11,048 --> 00:12:13,1
Ali Thornton, 23,
from Boise, Idaho.

327
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,6
Her info matches
the registration

328
00:12:14,081 --> 00:12:15,7
we found in the glove box.

329
00:12:15,098 --> 00:12:17,0
Hmm.

330
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,5
She was a long
way from home.

331
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:21,6
What were you doing here, Ali?

332
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,4
I'll see what I can
find on her.

333
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,7
Detectives,

334
00:12:25,091 --> 00:12:27,0
found something
in the master bedroom.

335
00:12:33,004 --> 00:12:34,4
Found this here in the bed.

336
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:37,4
And it matches the missing
fingernail of the victim.

337
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:40,4
Isn't this Ty's bedroom?

338
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:45,6
Yeah, looks like they did
a lot more than talk.

339
00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:47,4
(woman moaning
passionately nearby)

340
00:12:52,023 --> 00:12:54,0
(Lucifer moans with pleasure,
as woman's moans continue)

341
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,2
What the hell are you doing?

342
00:12:56,044 --> 00:12:58,7
Well, since you banished me
outside with the lepers,

343
00:12:58,094 --> 00:13:00,9
I decided to make myself useful.

344
00:13:01,011 --> 00:13:03,7
You call watching porn
on your phone useful?

345
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,4
This isn't my phone, Detective.

346
00:13:05,061 --> 00:13:07,2
I think it's
our recently departed's.

347
00:13:12,012 --> 00:13:13,3
Where did you get this?

348
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:15,2
Just heard a ringy-ding
and followed the noise.

349
00:13:15,042 --> 00:13:16,7
- Now, is delete
the little rubbish bin--?
- No.

350
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,9
You can't delete
anything on this phone.

351
00:13:19,013 --> 00:13:20,5
But it shows
Ty and Ali having sex.

352
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,0
It's very distracting.

353
00:13:22,026 --> 00:13:23,3
(quietly):
Wait.

354
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:24,6
Ooh, you've reached
the money shot?

355
00:13:24,088 --> 00:13:26,5
Are you taping this?

356
00:13:28,055 --> 00:13:30,3
TY: I don't know.

357
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,3
Over there,
we had a drink.

358
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,4
And I didn't know
the girl that well.

359
00:13:36,073 --> 00:13:38,4
Where are you going?

360
00:13:38,069 --> 00:13:40,9
Detective!

361
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:43,1
Hey!

362
00:13:43,032 --> 00:13:45,7
- What's going on?
- Detective, you're
making a mistake.

363
00:13:45,099 --> 00:13:46,9
Stay out of this, Lucifer.

364
00:13:47,011 --> 00:13:48,6
Cuff him.

365
00:13:48,087 --> 00:13:50,4
- Wait, what?
- Ty Huntley,
you're under arrest

366
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:51,6
for the murder
of Ali Thornton.

367
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,2
This is ridiculous.
Lucifer,

368
00:13:53,045 --> 00:13:55,0
this is all your fault.
I wish I'd never met you.

369
00:14:02,084 --> 00:14:04,0
(siren wailing in distance)

370
00:14:05,072 --> 00:14:07,4
(indistinct radio
communication)

371
00:14:08,076 --> 00:14:10,4
(sighs)
Trust me, Detective.

How are you so sure?

377
00:14:17,098 --> 00:14:19,4
What desire would Ty have
to kill a girl

378
00:14:19,069 --> 00:14:21,2
giving him a
wonderful time?

379
00:14:21,044 --> 00:14:23,2
Ty had a squeaky-clean image.

380
00:14:23,044 --> 00:14:25,4
He sleeps with a girl.

381
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:27,0
Then he finds out
she's taping him.

382
00:14:27,024 --> 00:14:28,8
She's gonna ruin everything.

383
00:14:29,007 --> 00:14:30,2
He gets angry
and loses control.

384
00:14:30,045 --> 00:14:31,7
You saw the video.

385
00:14:31,091 --> 00:14:32,9
The only thing that
that video proves

386
00:14:33,016 --> 00:14:34,1
is that Ty had sex.

387
00:14:34,033 --> 00:14:36,2
He was horny, not murderous.

388
00:14:36,046 --> 00:14:37,5
Then why would he lie about it?

389
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:39,1
Blame the tequila.

390
00:14:39,038 --> 00:14:41,4
He had motive and opportunity.

391
00:14:41,067 --> 00:14:43,6
Look, I just want to make sure

392
00:14:43,084 --> 00:14:45,2

Here's a deal.

558
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:51,6
Tell us everything,
and I don't

559
00:20:51,087 --> 00:20:52,6
cuff you in front of your
co-workers and take you in.

560
00:20:52,087 --> 00:20:54,2
I know how this goes.

561
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:56,2
Ali's a young actress
looking for a break.

562
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:58,8
An agent promises
to help her out, in exchange,

563
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,9
she's treated like a party
favor to your star clients.

564
00:21:01,017 --> 00:21:02,7
Okay, okay.

565
00:21:02,093 --> 00:21:05,3
I did call Ali.

566
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,4
I hired her to have sex with Ty.

567
00:21:07,068 --> 00:21:09,1
Wow, seems I wasn't
the only one

568
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,6
who wanted the young virgin
to loosen up.

569
00:21:11,089 --> 00:21:13,5
No, I loved the virgin angle.

570
00:21:13,077 --> 00:21:15,9
It's a clean hook,
got him a lot of attention.

571
00:21:17,019 --> 00:21:20,2
But Ty was a mess.

572
00:21:20,044 --> 00:21:21,6
I needed him

573
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:23,8
to get over his ex.

574
00:21:24,007 --> 00:21:24,9
Why?

575
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,7
Geez.

576
00:21:28,091 --> 00:21:31,5
Popular boy, this Ty--
isn't he?

577
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:34,3
So what, did this anger
his ex or something?

578
00:21:34,058 --> 00:21:37,8
No, it's from his ex,

579
00:21:38,004 --> 00:21:39,8
Debra Macall.
She left this behind

580
00:21:40,009 --> 00:21:41,4
one of the many
times she came here

581
00:21:41,063 --> 00:21:43,3
trying to find him.

582
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,0
She used to call all the time
trying to get a hold of him.

583
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,5
So, he dated a crazy fan?

584
00:21:46,072 --> 00:21:48,5
He didn't know it
at the beginning.

585
00:21:48,076 --> 00:21:50,8
So when I figured it out,
he had already fallen for her.

586
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,2
Oh, suppose I can
understand why.

587
00:21:53,043 --> 00:21:54,7
(chuckles)

588
00:21:54,098 --> 00:21:56,4
JOE: See, after a while,
Debra got possessive,

589
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,7
controlling--

590
00:21:57,098 --> 00:21:59,3
she thought
she was managing him.

591
00:21:59,056 --> 00:22:01,2
So I told Ty he needed
to break up with her.

592
00:22:01,044 --> 00:22:02,9
He refused.

593
00:22:03,011 --> 00:22:05,5
I made Ty file
a restraining order

594
00:22:05,078 --> 00:22:07,0
after she broke a girl's nose

595
00:22:07,028 --> 00:22:08,4
just for buying him a mojito.

596
00:22:08,066 --> 00:22:10,0
Quite a hair trigger
on this Debra,

597
00:22:10,024 --> 00:22:12,0
- by the sounds of it.
- Hmm.

598
00:22:12,029 --> 00:22:14,5
If Debra found out

599
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:16,5
that Ty was with
that poor girl...

600
00:22:23,076 --> 00:22:26,3
Hmm. Finally, some rain.

601
00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:28,3
Maybe someone up there
is looking out for us.

602
00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:30,0
I can assure you,

603
00:22:30,022 --> 00:22:32,2
He's in no way
meteorologically inclined.

604
00:22:32,047 --> 00:22:33,6
Apart from
the whole Noah thing,

605
00:22:33,081 --> 00:22:35,6
and that was a one-off.

606
00:22:40,031 --> 00:22:41,6
Anyhow, her roommate confirmed

607
00:22:41,086 --> 00:22:43,2
that she took
the 4:00 p.m. class, so...

608
00:22:43,048 --> 00:22:45,4
Ty's ex should be
out any second now.

609
00:22:45,069 --> 00:22:47,5
I told you
you had the wrong man.

610
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,2
Wrong gender as well,
apparently.

611
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:51,0
Finally, we're getting warmer.

612
00:22:51,024 --> 00:22:53,5
Why are you so hell-bent
on proving Ty's not the killer?

613
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:54,7
Like I've been saying,

614
00:22:54,095 --> 00:22:56,4
I want to punish
the real killer.

615
00:22:56,062 --> 00:22:58,2
But why?

616
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:00,0
Is it 'cause you pushed him
towards Ali at the party?

617
00:23:00,025 --> 00:23:02,2
Well, I don't see what that
has to do with anything.

618
00:23:02,046 --> 00:23:03,7
And I think you're starting
to agree with me.

619
00:23:03,096 --> 00:23:05,4
Otherwise, you wouldn't
be here, would you?

620
00:23:05,063 --> 00:23:06,7
- Bye!
- Bye!

621
00:23:06,097 --> 00:23:08,8
CHLOE:
There she is.

622
00:23:09,001 --> 00:23:11,9
(women conversing
indistinctly in distance)

623
00:23:12,018 --> 00:23:13,6
That was great.
I'll call you at lunch.

624
00:23:13,085 --> 00:23:15,4
I'm over here.
CHLOE:
Debra Macall?

625
00:23:15,068 --> 00:23:17,1
I'm Detective Decker, LAPD.

626
00:23:17,035 --> 00:23:19,0
We need to ask you a few
questions about Ty Huntley.

627
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:20,6
I've got nothing to say.

628
00:23:20,085 --> 00:23:22,1
It's either here
or down at the station.

629
00:23:22,036 --> 00:23:23,7
Leave me alone!
CHLOE: Debra...

630
00:23:28,049 --> 00:23:30,3
(car alarm blaring,
horn honking)

631
00:23:31,078 --> 00:23:33,6
See?

632
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:35,1
Warmer.

633
00:23:42,033 --> 00:23:45,2
(siren whoops)

634
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,7
Found this on
the undercarriage.

635
00:23:46,096 --> 00:23:48,3
Remote detonator.

636
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:50,9
Whoever set off
this bomb was nearby.

637
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:52,7
Scour the security cameras
in the area.

638
00:23:52,093 --> 00:23:55,1
Get facial I.D.'s on anyone
in a hundred-block radius.

639
00:23:57,027 --> 00:23:58,7
LUCIFER:
You couldn't live with yourself
for committing murder,

640
00:23:58,098 --> 00:24:00,1
so you set your car
to explode, didn't you?

641
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:02,0
Eh? Wanted to go out
in a blaze of glory.

642
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,2
Of course not!

643
00:24:03,048 --> 00:24:05,5
Murder? What are
you talking about?

644
00:24:05,073 --> 00:24:06,8
LUCIFER:
Oh, come on...

645
00:24:07,007 --> 00:24:08,6
The bomb was triggered remotely.

646
00:24:08,082 --> 00:24:10,5
Whoever set it off did it
before you got to the car.

647
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:11,9
There's a clear
line of sight.

648
00:24:12,016 --> 00:24:13,5
I don't think the plan
was to kill you.

649
00:24:13,074 --> 00:24:15,4
I think they wanted
to scare you.

650
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:17,7
So... you know of any reason why
someone would want to do that?

651
00:24:17,095 --> 00:24:20,1
No.

652
00:24:20,033 --> 00:24:21,5
Yes, why did you run, Debra?

653
00:24:21,071 --> 00:24:22,9
Awfully guilty-looking.

654
00:24:24,038 --> 00:24:25,6
I thought you were
going to bust me

655
00:24:25,084 --> 00:24:26,6
for violating
my restraining order.

656
00:24:28,005 --> 00:24:29,4
I went to Ty's party last night.

657
00:24:30,072 --> 00:24:31,8
I-I just...
I just looked.

658
00:24:32,009 --> 00:24:33,1
From outside,
through the window.

659
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,7
I couldn't help it, I miss him.

660
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:36,9
Yes, breaking up's
so hard, isn't it?

661
00:24:37,014 --> 00:24:38,6
You're like two
pathetic peas in a pod.

662
00:24:38,081 --> 00:24:40,3
Okay, we are made
for each other.

663
00:24:40,056 --> 00:24:41,8
As good as he is at football,

664
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,9
that's how good I am
at being his girlfriend.

665
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:45,5
You mean ex-girlfriend.

666
00:24:45,077 --> 00:24:47,6
We never stay broken up.
It's just a phase.

667
00:24:47,082 --> 00:24:50,5
And no one looks out
for him the way that I do.

668
00:24:50,074 --> 00:24:53,4
And then I saw him
kissing that girl and I...

669
00:24:53,066 --> 00:24:54,5
Squeezed the life out of her?

670
00:24:54,078 --> 00:24:55,9
DEBRA:
No!

671
00:24:57,003 --> 00:24:58,2
Where were you between

672
00:24:58,041 --> 00:24:59,2
1:00 and 3:00 a.m.
this morning?

673
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,9
The only place that
always makes me feel better.

674
00:25:04,012 --> 00:25:05,9
(sobbing)

675
00:25:08,042 --> 00:25:09,7
DAN: How long
does this go on?

676
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:10,9
CHLOE:
Three hours.

677
00:25:11,013 --> 00:25:13,0
(wry laugh)

678
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,5
That's the saddest thing
I've ever seen.

679
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,1
CHLOE:
Yep. All-night froyo shop

680
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,3
puts Debra there well past
the time of the victim's death.

681
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,8
Her alibi checks out.

682
00:25:22,043 --> 00:25:24,2
So Debra didn't strangle Ali.

683
00:25:24,048 --> 00:25:26,2
Well, whoever
planted the bomb

684
00:25:26,048 --> 00:25:28,4
went to great lengths
to make us think Debra did it.

685
00:25:28,065 --> 00:25:29,8
Why?

686
00:25:30,007 --> 00:25:30,9
I don't know.

687
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:38,2
We might actually know
who rigged the car.

688
00:25:41,004 --> 00:25:41,9
Ronnie Hillman.

689
00:25:43,025 --> 00:25:45,2
CHLOE:
The big Hollywood fixer?

690
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:46,3
Yeah.

691
00:25:46,054 --> 00:25:47,8
A security cam
caught her

692
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:49,1
walking nearby,
right after the explosion.

693
00:25:49,034 --> 00:25:50,5
This can't be a coincidence.

694
00:25:50,075 --> 00:25:52,1
Someone must've
hired her for this.

695
00:25:52,038 --> 00:25:54,2
I've been trying to build a case
on her for years,

696
00:25:54,047 --> 00:25:55,5
and every time
we've approached her,

697
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,5
she's lawyered up immediately.

698
00:25:57,072 --> 00:25:58,8
Ronnie is a pro.

699
00:25:59,005 --> 00:26:00,1
So how do we approach her?

700
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:01,3
She's picky about
talking to strangers.

701
00:26:01,052 --> 00:26:03,8
Definitely no cops.

702
00:26:07,085 --> 00:26:09,8
What about someone

703
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:12,2
she'd never expect us
to work with?

704
00:26:12,048 --> 00:26:14,2
LUCIFER:
Do I get a code word?

705
00:26:14,049 --> 00:26:16,1
You know, for when
you take her down.

706
00:26:16,036 --> 00:26:18,0
If so,
might I suggest

707
00:26:18,024 --> 00:26:19,3
"monkey bottoms"?

708
00:26:19,057 --> 00:26:20,7
'Cause trust me, I can work that

709
00:26:20,095 --> 00:26:21,8
into any sentence
quite naturally.

710
00:26:22,008 --> 00:26:23,8
You sure this
is a good idea?

711
00:26:24,004 --> 00:26:25,6
Lucifer reached out to her

712
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,7
and she agreed to meet him,
so it's our best shot.

713
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,1
And you won't need a code word,
and you won't be miked,

714
00:26:30,034 --> 00:26:31,5
because she'll be
looking for that.

715
00:26:31,071 --> 00:26:32,9
This is a simple handoff.

716
00:26:33,013 --> 00:26:34,5
All we need you to do
is vouch for Dan

717
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,0
as someone
that needs her services.

718
00:26:36,022 --> 00:26:37,7
Vouch for Detective Douche?

719
00:26:37,093 --> 00:26:40,6
Oh, gosh, this is gonna
be harder than I thought.

720
00:26:40,089 --> 00:26:41,9
Once I engage with her,
I will hire her

721
00:26:42,014 --> 00:26:43,0
to fix a problem
of mine.

722
00:26:43,027 --> 00:26:44,5
Right.

723
00:26:44,072 --> 00:26:46,4
Well, if it's
that stick up your ass,

724
00:26:46,069 --> 00:26:47,7
I'm afraid there's no one
strong enough to pull that out.

725
00:26:47,098 --> 00:26:49,2
She goes there
to fix my problem,

726
00:26:49,048 --> 00:26:50,9
our people will be waiting
to arrest her.

727
00:26:51,015 --> 00:26:52,4
Ah.
CHLOE: And then we'll
have leverage

728
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:53,9
to find out what she knows
about Ali's murder.

729
00:26:54,015 --> 00:26:55,1
She has information we need,

730
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,8
so let's just stick to the plan.

731
00:26:57,007 --> 00:26:58,4
Assuming, of course,
Ronnie hasn't run off

732
00:26:58,061 --> 00:26:59,8
because our sting
suddenly turned into

733
00:27:00,003 --> 00:27:01,0
a Michael Bublé concert.

734
00:27:02,074 --> 00:27:03,9
Lucifer,
this isn't a game.

735
00:27:04,012 --> 00:27:06,1
- Oh.
- Now, are you
up for this or not?

736
00:27:06,037 --> 00:27:09,8
Am I up for encouraging someone
to commit a nefarious act?

737
00:27:10,008 --> 00:27:11,5
Mm, let me think.

738

00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:01,8
Oh...

757
00:28:02,001 --> 00:28:03,1
(laughs)

758
00:28:03,035 --> 00:28:04,5
Mm, you checking for a wire

759
00:28:04,076 --> 00:28:05,6
or are you just pleased
to see me?

760
00:28:05,081 --> 00:28:07,5
(laughs)

761
00:28:07,077 --> 00:28:09,1
Little bit of both.

762
00:28:09,031 --> 00:28:10,3
Mmm! (chuckles)

763
00:28:10,052 --> 00:28:11,9
Hello, Mr. Morningstar.

764
00:28:12,019 --> 00:28:14,5
Rest assured...

765
00:28:14,077 --> 00:28:16,3
I can help you
with your problem.

766
00:28:16,052 --> 00:28:18,9
Well, actually,
I don't need your help.

767
00:28:19,015 --> 00:28:20,6
I...

768
00:28:20,082 --> 00:28:22,7
Wait, what do you think
my problem is?

769
00:28:22,095 --> 00:28:24,6
Impostor running around
ruining your name.

770
00:28:24,082 --> 00:28:27,8
Your professional reputation
has taken a bit of a dive.

771
00:28:29,058 --> 00:28:32,8
As has your sexual one,
I'm afraid.

772
00:28:33,004 --> 00:28:34,9
All those
unsatisfied ladies...

773
00:28:35,017 --> 00:28:36,8
Word gets around.

774
00:28:38,071 --> 00:28:40,8
That is the reason
you reached out to me, isn't it?

775
00:28:45,035 --> 00:28:46,4
Yes.

776
00:28:46,064 --> 00:28:48,1
Yes, it very much is.

777
00:28:48,031 --> 00:28:49,9
I do have a problem
that could use your help.

778
00:28:50,018 --> 00:28:51,6
I am all yours.

779
00:28:51,089 --> 00:28:53,7
Oh! Well, I like you,
monkey bottoms. (chuckles)

780
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:55,8
Here's what I need you to do...

781
00:28:56,002 --> 00:28:57,4
♪... doing what I'm told...♪

782
00:28:57,061 --> 00:28:59,1
(whispering):
Lucifer, what are you doing?

783
00:28:59,036 --> 00:29:00,4
(music playing over speakers)

784
00:29:00,069 --> 00:29:01,8
Hey, Dan, what's going on?

785
00:29:03,078 --> 00:29:05,1
DAN:
I don't know.

786
00:29:05,037 --> 00:29:06,8
They're still talking.

787
00:29:09,066 --> 00:29:11,8
And now she's leaving.

788
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:15,8
LUCIFER:
Lovely.

789
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:19,1
What the hell did you do?

790
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:22,3
I hired the fixer to fix
a problem, like you wanted.

791
00:29:22,055 --> 00:29:23,8
You let her go.
What happened to the plan?

792
00:29:24,001 --> 00:29:25,7
- I made a better one.
- How?

793
00:29:25,093 --> 00:29:27,0
Just sit tight

794
00:29:27,026 --> 00:29:28,3
and we'll all get what we want.

795
00:29:36,015 --> 00:29:38,6
(gasps, grunts)

796
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:40,6
- Finally!
- (whimpers)

797
00:29:40,086 --> 00:29:43,4
The would-be Prince of Darkness.

798
00:29:43,065 --> 00:29:45,2
Payment due
upon delivery.

799
00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:46,7
(wry laugh)

800
00:29:46,091 --> 00:29:48,9
I'd like to examine
the goods first.

801
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,0
RONNIE:
Your dime.

802
00:29:54,033 --> 00:29:56,2
Right.

803
00:29:56,042 --> 00:29:58,5
Let's see the face
of my impostor.

804
00:30:02,017 --> 00:30:03,4
(Maze laughs)

805
00:30:05,018 --> 00:30:06,8
The resemblance
is uncanny.

806
00:30:09,076 --> 00:30:13,2
It most certainly is not.

807
00:30:13,043 --> 00:30:14,7
(giggling)

808
00:30:14,093 --> 00:30:16,5
How could anyone think
that you were me?

809
00:30:16,077 --> 00:30:18,2
(false British accent): You know
who you're messing with?

810
00:30:19,081 --> 00:30:21,2
I'm Lucifer
freaking Morningstar!

811
00:30:21,044 --> 00:30:22,9
Oh...

812
00:30:23,011 --> 00:30:24,3
Are you now?

813
00:30:24,057 --> 00:30:27,0
Well... you've certainly
been a busy bee,

814
00:30:27,028 --> 00:30:29,0
haven't you, "Lucifer"?

815
00:30:29,028 --> 00:30:30,4
Eh?

816
00:30:30,066 --> 00:30:32,4
Apparently, you've started
a modeling agency,

817
00:30:32,066 --> 00:30:35,2
pitched a Web series.

818
00:30:36,058 --> 00:30:37,7
And I hear
you've also been

819
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,9
very active with the women.

820
00:30:40,013 --> 00:30:41,0
Ladies love me.

821
00:30:41,029 --> 00:30:43,3
What can I say?

822
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:45,3
It's what they've been saying
that's the trouble.

823
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:48,2
It seems you're a bit
of a two-pump chump.

824
00:30:48,047 --> 00:30:50,3
Also, a crier afterwards.

825
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,8
That happened one time.

826
00:30:52,001 --> 00:30:54,3
Right. Well, we can't
have you running around

827
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,9
cheapening the Lucifer brand,
now, can we?

828
00:30:57,014 --> 00:30:58,2
What do you say, Maze?

829
00:30:58,052 --> 00:31:00,2
Impalement?

830
00:31:00,048 --> 00:31:01,5
MAZE:
Hmm...

831
00:31:01,077 --> 00:31:04,2
Why rush?

832
00:31:04,044 --> 00:31:06,1
- I say the rack.
- Oh.

833
00:31:06,036 --> 00:31:07,6
- Oh!
- Ooh.

834
00:31:07,086 --> 00:31:09,1
That way,

835
00:31:09,036 --> 00:31:10,9
we can really enjoy it.

836
00:31:11,012 --> 00:31:12,8
LUCIFER: Better.
Yes, much better.

837
00:31:13,003 --> 00:31:15,1
Every joint of every limb

838
00:31:15,033 --> 00:31:17,1
dislocated before it's torn off.

839
00:31:17,033 --> 00:31:19,9
No, no, no, no, no-- look, look,
look, I just... I just...

840
00:31:20,017 --> 00:31:22,3
I just wanted to get chicks
and-and free drinks.

841
00:31:22,054 --> 00:31:24,0
Um, really.

842
00:31:25,063 --> 00:31:27,2
(dropping accent):
My name is Justin.

843
00:31:27,047 --> 00:31:28,2
I'm from Sherman Oaks.

844
00:31:28,047 --> 00:31:29,2
(Maze and Lucifer laughing)

845
00:31:29,047 --> 00:31:31,4
Oh, Justin...

846
00:31:31,068 --> 00:31:33,4
the things I'm gonna do to you.

847
00:31:33,064 --> 00:31:34,8
Oh, no, no, no,
I-I'm sorry!

848
00:31:35,001 --> 00:31:36,0
I only came here one time

849
00:31:36,022 --> 00:31:37,8
and I just told some girls

850
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:39,3
that I owned the place, and...

851
00:31:39,056 --> 00:31:40,8
and that opened
some doors for me

852
00:31:41,006 --> 00:31:42,1
and so I just
started rolling with it.

853
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,9
How dare you abscond my name!

854
00:31:45,015 --> 00:31:46,6
Please, don't hurt me.

855
00:31:46,086 --> 00:31:48,0
Please.

856
00:31:48,028 --> 00:31:49,4
LUCIFER:
I'm not gonna hurt you,

857
00:31:49,065 --> 00:31:51,6
Justin,
I'm going to destroy you.

858
00:31:51,087 --> 00:31:54,0
Oh, this is so hot.

859
00:31:54,024 --> 00:31:56,6
It's like you're
punishing yourself.

860
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:05,3
Seems I could be just, um,

861
00:32:05,055 --> 00:32:06,8
overreacting a bit.

862
00:32:11,051 --> 00:32:13,1
Go.

863
00:32:13,034 --> 00:32:14,3
Go on!

864
00:32:16,051 --> 00:32:17,8
And never sully my name again.

865
00:32:22,015 --> 00:32:23,6
Let's at least take a finger.

866
00:32:23,086 --> 00:32:25,0
We've done enough, Maze.

867
00:32:32,053 --> 00:32:33,7
Pleasure doing business
with you, Lucifer.

868
00:32:33,099 --> 00:32:35,7
Yes, it was, wasn't it?

869
00:32:35,099 --> 00:32:37,7
Which is why I'm going to have
to apologize for my friends.

870
00:32:37,099 --> 00:32:39,0
What friends?

871
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,7
CHLOE:
Ronnie Hillman,

872
00:32:40,096 --> 00:32:42,0
you're under arrest
for kidnapping and assault.

873
00:32:46,096 --> 00:32:48,8
Would you mind
calling my lawyer?

874
00:32:49,005 --> 00:32:50,8
(handcuffs tightening)
Her number's in
my back pocket.

875
00:32:51,001 --> 00:32:52,4
Yeah, sure thing.

876
00:32:52,068 --> 00:32:53,8
I'll tell her
about the kidnapping,

877
00:32:54,009 --> 00:32:55,5
the airtight evidence we have,

878
00:32:55,076 --> 00:32:57,5
the attempted murder
on Debra Macall,

879
00:32:57,072 --> 00:32:59,7
and then when we connect you
to Ali Thornton's murder,

880
00:32:59,093 --> 00:33:01,0
maybe you'll get
a nice injection of drugs,

881
00:33:01,027 --> 00:33:03,0
and you can go to sleep forever.

882
00:33:03,027 --> 00:33:07,3
Hang on-- I had nothing
to do with Ali's murder.

883
00:33:07,057 --> 00:33:11,3
Debra Macall, Ty Huntley's ex,
she's the murderer.

884
00:33:11,057 --> 00:33:13,3
I cared about Ali.

885
00:33:13,053 --> 00:33:15,2
Mm-hmm, here's what I think.

886
00:33:15,049 --> 00:33:17,4
I think you tried to scare Debra
into confessing to Ali's murder,

887
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,8
but Debra didn't do it.

888
00:33:19,004 --> 00:33:20,5
She's got an ironclad alibi.

889
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:25,5
This is my fault.

890
00:33:25,071 --> 00:33:27,5
Why?

891
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:31,1
I promised Ali
I would protect her.

892
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:33,8
All she ever wanted
was to be an actress.

893
00:33:34,005 --> 00:33:35,5
She was gonna leave her mark.

894
00:33:35,072 --> 00:33:36,8
But you know how that goes.

895
00:33:37,001 --> 00:33:40,2
Endless rejection,
she ran out of money.

896
00:33:40,047 --> 00:33:43,2
This was her first gig with me.

897
00:33:43,048 --> 00:33:45,2
She didn't even know
if she could do it.

898
00:33:45,048 --> 00:33:49,6
But I told her... I told her
it was just like acting.

899
00:33:49,082 --> 00:33:52,9
Besides, who doesn't want
to sleep with Ty Huntley?

900
00:33:53,015 --> 00:33:55,6
I thought Ty's agent hired
Ali to sleep with him.

901
00:33:55,082 --> 00:33:58,9
He hired me for a number
three special: blackmail.

902
00:33:59,012 --> 00:34:01,9
Slip him a roofie, get naked,
whip out a selfie stick,

903
00:34:02,012 --> 00:34:03,2
and voilà.

904
00:34:03,045 --> 00:34:04,9
LUCIFER: Why would
he have any desire

905
00:34:05,012 --> 00:34:06,5
to blackmail his
own star client,

906
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:08,1
a client he's all
about protecting?

907
00:34:08,033 --> 00:34:11,0
Ty's agent told you
that Debra killed Ali.

908
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:13,7
He did, yeah.

909
00:34:23,064 --> 00:34:25,1
You think Joe's the killer,

910
00:34:25,035 --> 00:34:28,0
that he took things into
his own hands, quite literally.

911
00:34:28,027 --> 00:34:29,5
We don't have any proof.

912
00:34:29,077 --> 00:34:32,5
Right, well, how do you
propose that we get him?

913
00:34:34,019 --> 00:34:35,7
Joe pointed the finger
right at Debra,

914
00:34:35,095 --> 00:34:37,4
painted her as crazy.

915
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:39,3
It's not that hard a picture
to paint, in her case.

916
00:34:39,053 --> 00:34:41,3
Why was he so certain
she'd make a good suspect?

917
00:34:41,053 --> 00:34:44,4
Maybe he found out
she went to Ty's party.

918
00:34:44,066 --> 00:34:46,6
Maybe he knew she
went to Ty's party.

919
00:35:00,005 --> 00:35:03,5
You are looking
at the future of football.

920
00:35:03,077 --> 00:35:05,7
The American Dream.

921
00:35:05,093 --> 00:35:09,9
Honest, resilient, heroic.

922
00:35:10,019 --> 00:35:12,3
The police tried to pin

923
00:35:12,052 --> 00:35:16,4
the death of that
poor girl on you.

924
00:35:16,061 --> 00:35:19,2
But we kept it
out of the press.

925
00:35:19,041 --> 00:35:22,4
We got you out of jail.

926
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:24,5
We will always
protect you...

927
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:27,5
and make you a bigger
star than ever.

928
00:35:27,075 --> 00:35:30,3
This is
Ty Huntley...

929
00:35:30,058 --> 00:35:32,7
rebranded. (laughs)

930
00:35:38,051 --> 00:35:39,4
LUCIFER:
Rebranded, eh?

931
00:35:39,063 --> 00:35:41,0
Does it come
with a new scent?

932
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:42,2
Free toy inside?

933
00:35:42,047 --> 00:35:44,1
What do you want?

934
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:46,6
Ty is free on bail.

935
00:35:46,089 --> 00:35:48,8
We have to talk to Ty
down at the station again,

936
00:35:49,006 --> 00:35:50,6
maybe walk him
past a few reporters.

937
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:52,0
Whoa, hold on, uh,
Joe, what is this?

938
00:35:52,027 --> 00:35:53,7
Oh, come on!
This is ridiculous.

939
00:35:53,098 --> 00:35:56,0
Ty wouldn't
hurt anybody!

940
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:57,4
What about Debra?

941
00:35:57,061 --> 00:35:58,6
I told you to look into her.

942
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:00,2
She's the crazy one.

943
00:36:00,049 --> 00:36:01,9
Yes, well, I thought
it was her all along.

944
00:36:02,016 --> 00:36:03,8
I mean, the woman certainly
redefines "intensity."

945
00:36:04,008 --> 00:36:06,4
But Debra was home with a friend
the night of the murder.

946
00:36:06,066 --> 00:36:07,6
What?!

947
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:09,3
She's lying.

948
00:36:09,058 --> 00:36:10,6
There's no evidence
placing her at the party.

949
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:11,9
No one saw her.

950
00:36:12,017 --> 00:36:14,2
So are you ready
to face the cameras?

951
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:15,9
His sponsors will love
the free publicity.

952
00:36:16,017 --> 00:36:18,7
Tell me, what's
ten percent of nothing?

953
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:20,3
I saw Debra there.

954
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:24,2
I went by the party.

955
00:36:25,097 --> 00:36:29,7
But a work call came up,
and I never made it inside.

956
00:36:29,093 --> 00:36:31,6
I didn't say anything before

957
00:36:31,085 --> 00:36:34,4
because I told my wife
I was working late.

958
00:36:34,061 --> 00:36:38,5
When I was driving away,
I saw Debra outside Ty's window.

959
00:36:38,078 --> 00:36:41,1
So you admit you were
there that night.

960
00:36:41,036 --> 00:36:43,8
Yeah, and so was Debra.

961
00:36:44,003 --> 00:36:45,1
That's the proof
you need, right?

962
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:46,7
CHLOE: That's
the proof we need.

963
00:36:46,099 --> 00:36:48,9
We have a sworn statement
from Ronnie Hillman

964
00:36:49,012 --> 00:36:50,4
saying that you hired the victim

965
00:36:50,062 --> 00:36:52,4
to make a sex tape with
Ty to blackmail him.

966
00:36:52,062 --> 00:36:54,0
I just needed to place
you at the scene.

967
00:36:54,029 --> 00:36:55,7
LUCIFER: Yeah, see,
that's why I don't lie.

968
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,6
It's so hard to keep track
of who knows what.

969
00:36:57,084 --> 00:36:59,5
It's not true.

970
00:36:59,071 --> 00:37:02,0
I only want what's
best for you, Ty.

971
00:37:02,022 --> 00:37:03,6
You know, I still
don't understand.

972
00:37:03,084 --> 00:37:05,5
Why is it my own agent
would want to blackmail me?

973
00:37:05,072 --> 00:37:07,8
Because he thought eventually
you were gonna leave him.

974
00:37:08,006 --> 00:37:09,7
What, because I took one meeting
with another agency?

975
00:37:10,098 --> 00:37:12,1
Joe...

976
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:13,6
I only did that
to make Debra happy.

977
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:15,0
But even though
you'd broken up,

978
00:37:15,023 --> 00:37:16,5
he knew you'd get
back together,

979
00:37:16,073 --> 00:37:19,1
so he decided to strike first,
get some leverage.

980
00:37:19,032 --> 00:37:22,5
If he left me,
I would be ruined.

981
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:24,2
I mean,
do you understand?

982
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:26,0
He is my Brady, my Manning.

983
00:37:26,024 --> 00:37:28,3
But Ali wasn't cut out
for this sort of thing, was she?

984
00:37:28,058 --> 00:37:29,7
She didn't want
to give you the video.

985
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:31,3
Stupid bitch.

986
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:36,0
She said she realized
Ty was a good guy.

987
00:37:36,021 --> 00:37:37,6
She didn't want to go
through with it.

988
00:37:37,084 --> 00:37:40,6
Her name was Ali Thornton,
and you killed her.

989
00:37:40,084 --> 00:37:41,8
For what?

990
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:44,0
Greed? Ego?

991
00:37:44,026 --> 00:37:45,3
I didn't want to hurt her.

992
00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:47,8
I just wanted her phone. And...

993
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,7
(Joe sighs)

994
00:37:54,035 --> 00:37:56,2
But I squeezed too hard.

995
00:37:58,006 --> 00:37:59,0
I'm done.

996
00:37:59,023 --> 00:38:01,1
Forget this.
I'm out of here.

997
00:38:06,007 --> 00:38:08,4
(gasps)

998
00:38:08,062 --> 00:38:09,9
Did I squeeze too hard?

999
00:38:11,074 --> 00:38:13,9
How did you...?

1000
00:38:14,012 --> 00:38:15,2
What did...?

1001
00:38:15,046 --> 00:38:17,2
Lucifer, what are you doing?

1002
00:38:17,046 --> 00:38:19,4
Finally focusing my
anger where it belongs.

1003
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:20,5
Lucifer...

1004
00:38:24,005 --> 00:38:27,2
(chuckles)

1005
00:38:27,043 --> 00:38:29,6
Yes, of course.

1006
00:38:29,085 --> 00:38:31,4
Your turn, Detective.

1007
00:38:31,064 --> 00:38:34,7
(sirens wailing,
radio chatter)

1008
00:38:40,073 --> 00:38:43,1
I still can't believe
Joe did this.

1009
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,7
I wasn't ever gonna
leave him, you know that?

1010
00:38:46,095 --> 00:38:48,4
Definitely gonna leave him now.

1011
00:38:48,061 --> 00:38:50,0
But you know what,
you, uh...

1012
00:38:50,028 --> 00:38:51,9
you stayed good
to your word, Lucifer.

1013
00:38:52,012 --> 00:38:53,1
Thank you.

1014
00:38:53,033 --> 00:38:56,0
Yes, well, now you owe me one.

1015
00:38:58,087 --> 00:39:00,9
DEBRA:
Ty!

1016
00:39:01,013 --> 00:39:02,5
Ty! Ty!

1017
00:39:04,046 --> 00:39:05,8
Oh, my baby.

1018
00:39:06,005 --> 00:39:07,1
Oh, my God, I'm
so glad to see you.

1019
00:39:07,034 --> 00:39:09,4
- Oh.
- You are?

1020
00:39:09,064 --> 00:39:10,9
Yes, you are
crazy, baby.

1021
00:39:11,018 --> 00:39:12,9
- But you're my crazy,
you hear me?
- Yeah?

1022
00:39:14,097 --> 00:39:17,1
Warms the cockles,
doesn't it?

1023
00:39:18,094 --> 00:39:20,2
So, Detective,

1024
00:39:20,048 --> 00:39:21,9
looks like you've
solved another case

1025
00:39:22,019 --> 00:39:22,9
because of me.

1026
00:39:23,019 --> 00:39:24,7
I solved this case despite you.

1027
00:39:24,098 --> 00:39:26,7
What? What about the
cell phone I found?

1028
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:28,1
That was key evidence.

1029
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,7
Evidence you
almost destroyed.

1030
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:32,2
I got you the leverage
you needed to crack Ronnie.

1031
00:39:32,049 --> 00:39:34,5
You co-opted a sting operation
for your own gain.

1032
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,8
And I solved another crime.

1033
00:39:37,004 --> 00:39:39,2
Identity theft.
(chuckles)

1034
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:42,2
Come on, admit it--
we solved this one together.

1035
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:44,7
Or are you too egotistical
to acknowledge my help?

1036
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:49,3
Okay, yeah, you didn't
completely destroy the case.

1037
00:39:49,055 --> 00:39:51,6
So you can stop blaming
yourself, great.

1038
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:53,0
Whatever do you mean?

1039
00:39:54,085 --> 00:39:57,3
The whole reason you tried
to prove Ty's innocence?

1040
00:39:57,052 --> 00:39:59,2
Was to catch the true culprit.

1041
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:02,8
Yeah, sure.

1042
00:40:07,003 --> 00:40:09,1
LUCIFER: So I decided
not to punish myself.

1043
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:10,7
Yourself?

1044
00:40:10,099 --> 00:40:13,1
Well, my fake self.

1045
00:40:13,032 --> 00:40:14,4
The person
I'd kidnapped.

1046
00:40:14,066 --> 00:40:16,7
I decided not
to beat him up.

1047
00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:19,2
(sighs) You were right,
I was, um...

1048
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,8
(sighs loudly with satisfaction)
What's the word?

1049
00:40:21,008 --> 00:40:22,5
Displacing?

1050
00:40:22,075 --> 00:40:25,5
...displacing my anger
and frustration on Luci-phony,

1051
00:40:25,075 --> 00:40:28,6
because the right person wasn't
being punished for Ali's death.

1052
00:40:28,084 --> 00:40:30,6
And who was the right person?

1053
00:40:30,084 --> 00:40:33,3
Well, the sleazy
agent, of course.

1054
00:40:33,051 --> 00:40:35,6
Ah, yeah.

1055
00:40:35,085 --> 00:40:38,8
Of all the cities in
the world, Lucifer,

1056
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:41,5
why did you decide
to come to Los Angeles?

1057
00:40:41,073 --> 00:40:43,5
Well, the same reason
as everyone else.

1058
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:45,2
Uh, the weather,
porn stars,

1059
00:40:45,048 --> 00:40:47,0
Mexican food-- mm!

1060
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:48,7
Mmm.

1061
00:40:48,098 --> 00:40:50,5
You know, you say... you
say people are phony here,

1062
00:40:50,078 --> 00:40:54,5
but I think people come here
to reinvent themselves.

1063
00:40:54,078 --> 00:40:56,5
And I think that's
why you're here.

1064
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:58,5
To reinvent yourself.

1065
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:01,0
Why would I mess
with perfection?

1066
00:41:02,087 --> 00:41:05,2
You like working with
the detective, don't you?

1067
00:41:08,009 --> 00:41:09,9
I told you, I'm good
at punishing people--

1068
00:41:10,013 --> 00:41:12,6
nay, I'm the best
at punishing bad people.

1069
00:41:12,088 --> 00:41:15,0
I didn't enjoy it when
my father forced me to,

1070
00:41:15,022 --> 00:41:17,0
but now that it's
on my own terms,

1071
00:41:17,022 --> 00:41:19,0
it's downright delightful.

1072
00:41:19,022 --> 00:41:21,0
Yeah, well, I think
you don't just enjoy

1073
00:41:21,023 --> 00:41:23,0
punishing the bad guys.

1074
00:41:23,023 --> 00:41:25,0
I think you're starting
to like seeking justice

1075
00:41:25,023 --> 00:41:27,0
for the good ones.

1076
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,4
Like Ali.

1077
00:41:31,065 --> 00:41:32,7
(Lucifer scoffs)

1078
00:41:34,086 --> 00:41:36,3
It's another reason
to hate L.A.--

1079
00:41:36,057 --> 00:41:38,0
all this self-
indulgent therapy.

1080
00:41:38,024 --> 00:41:39,2
You should be ashamed.

1081
00:41:39,045 --> 00:41:40,5
You're doing it again.

1082
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,7
What?

1083
00:41:41,091 --> 00:41:43,3
Displacing.

1084
00:41:43,058 --> 00:41:45,3
No, I'm not.

1085
00:41:45,058 --> 00:41:46,8
And that's denial.

1086
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:49,1
That's a river in Africa.

1087
00:41:49,034 --> 00:41:51,1
