00:07:40,012 --> 00:07:41,2
is gonna be
quite difficult for you.

186
00:07:42,092 --> 00:07:44,7
Pull yourself together.

187
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:47,5
That's it, that's
all I'm asking.

188
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,6
'Cause you're wasting
your talent, your life.

189
00:07:50,088 --> 00:07:52,9
Hmm?

190
00:07:55,026 --> 00:07:57,7
You're human, darling.
(chuckles)

191
00:07:57,097 --> 00:08:00,0
I'm gonna do
as you asked.

192
00:08:00,023 --> 00:08:02,3
I'm gonna get
it together.

193
00:08:02,056 --> 00:08:04,6
Promise, Lucifer.

194
00:08:04,081 --> 00:08:06,6
Look, it's not about me.

195
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:10,1
What happens now,
that's up to you.

196
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:12,4
- Okay?
- Yeah.

197
00:08:12,061 --> 00:08:13,7
Come here, you.

198
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:17,9

202
00:08:58,095 --> 00:08:59,9
What did you do?

203
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,4
I'm sorry.

204
00:09:01,066 --> 00:09:03,5
"Sorry."

205
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:05,6
Why did you end her life?

206
00:09:05,088 --> 00:09:07,6
Why else?

207
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,0
Money.

208
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,0
"Money."

209
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:14,5
Oh, it's times like this
I wish I was still in Hell.

210
00:09:14,072 --> 00:09:17,8
All the fun activities
I'd have planned for you.

211
00:09:18,005 --> 00:09:20,2
Hey, man, I just
pulled the trigger.

MAN: Want to hear
what I've got so far?

221
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:17,7
Lieutenant said
this is my case.

222
00:10:17,091 --> 00:10:20,5
Yeah, Chloe,
it is your case,

223
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,2
but try not to take
too much time.

224
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,4
It's an easy one.

225
00:10:23,062 --> 00:10:24,9
That's our bad guy.

226
00:10:25,012 --> 00:10:27,8
Eddie Deacon, he's
a low-level drug dealer.

227
00:10:28,004 --> 00:10:29,3
I found these in his pocket,

228
00:10:29,054 --> 00:10:31,2
and I found this
in Delilah's purse,

229
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,8
so obviously drug-related.

230
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:34,9
She probably owed him
a bunch of cash or something.

231
00:10:35,013 --> 00:10:37,2
She's not exactly selling out
stadiums these days.

232
00:10:37,047 --> 00:10:38,4
How do you know
he's low-level?

233
00:10:38,063 --> 00:10:40,5
Look at his car.

234
00:10:40,076 --> 00:10:42,2
Did you look at his watch?

235
00:10:42,043 --> 00:10:43,4
That thing ain't cheap.

236
00:10:43,068 --> 00:10:45,2
MAN:
It's probably fake.

237
00:10:45,047 --> 00:10:47,2
Look...

238
00:10:47,048 --> 00:10:50,2
there's gonna be a lot of
attention on this one, Chloe.

239
00:10:50,048 --> 00:10:52,2
I wouldn't pick at it too hard.

240
00:10:52,048 --> 00:10:53,9
Not after Palmetto Street.

241
00:10:54,015 --> 00:10:56,9
I asked for this case
because of Palmetto Street, Dan.

242
00:10:58,099 --> 00:11:01,2
So, anyway, any witnesses?

243
00:11:01,049 --> 00:11:04,0
LUCIFER:
Lucifer Morningstar.

244
00:11:04,024 --> 00:11:06,7
"Lucifer
Morningstar"?

245
00:11:06,091 --> 00:11:09,7
Is that, uh,
a stage name or something?

246
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,6
(chuckles)
God-given, I'm afraid.

247
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,8
You know,

248
00:11:13,004 --> 00:11:13,9
you look familiar.

249
00:11:14,013 --> 00:11:15,1
Have we met before?

250
00:11:15,034 --> 00:11:17,8
Yeah, five minutes ago.

251
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:19,6
And I'm asking the questions.

252
00:11:19,088 --> 00:11:21,9
Talk to me about your
relationship with the victim.

253
00:11:22,018 --> 00:11:24,3
Well, she used to work here
a few years back.

254
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,8
I would occasionally
accompany her while she sang.

255
00:11:27,002 --> 00:11:30,2
Then she became a big star and
someone decided to end her life.

256
00:11:30,048 --> 00:11:31,9
Do you know the shooter?

257
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,6
No, but we did have
an interesting little chat

258
00:11:33,081 --> 00:11:35,7
just before he kicked off.

259
00:11:35,098 --> 00:11:37,8
I asked him why he did it.

260
00:11:38,007 --> 00:11:39,4
Huh, like to play cop, do you?

261
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,9
(laughs)

262
00:11:41,016 --> 00:11:42,8
No, I just like to play
in general, Detective.

263
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:44,2
What about you?

264
00:11:44,049 --> 00:11:47,7
So, you had a conversation
with a dead guy?

265
00:11:47,091 --> 00:11:49,1
Oh, no, he wasn't quite dead.

266
00:11:49,037 --> 00:11:50,2
His soul hadn't
crossed the threshold.

267
00:11:51,087 --> 00:11:53,9
I see.
Did he tell you why he did it?

268
00:11:54,017 --> 00:11:55,8
Why, money, of course.

269
00:11:56,009 --> 00:11:58,1
You humans, you love your money,
don't you?

270
00:11:58,034 --> 00:11:59,7
Yes.

271
00:11:59,092 --> 00:12:01,1
Yes, we do.

272
00:12:01,038 --> 00:12:03,2
And, uh, what planet
are you from-- London?

273
00:12:03,047 --> 00:12:04,8
(laughs)

274
00:12:05,001 --> 00:12:07,1
Yes, he also said,
"I just pulled the trigger."

275
00:12:07,031 --> 00:12:09,5
Now, don't you think
that's interesting?

276
00:12:09,073 --> 00:12:11,5
Delilah was shot to death
by a drug dealer.

277
00:12:11,073 --> 00:12:14,5
And looks like Delilah herself
kept the guy pretty busy.

278
00:12:14,073 --> 00:12:17,1
You know, it's sad, it's ugly,
but it's not rocket science.

279
00:12:17,032 --> 00:12:18,6
Something probably
went south between them.

280
00:12:18,086 --> 00:12:20,1
She gets riddled with bullets,

281
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,3
and a nice little act of God
takes him out.

282
00:12:22,053 --> 00:12:24,3
You know, it doesn't work
like that, Detective.

283
00:12:24,057 --> 00:12:26,2
It's quite a neatly wrapped
little present

284
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,7
for the LAPD, don't you think?

285
00:12:27,091 --> 00:12:29,5
Why don't you tell me something?

286
00:12:29,075 --> 00:12:31,0
How does she end up

287
00:12:31,021 --> 00:12:32,3
dying in a hailstorm of bullets,

288
00:12:32,058 --> 00:12:34,1
and you get away
without a scratch?

289
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:35,8
I think that's interesting.
Don't you?

290
00:12:36,004 --> 00:12:37,0
The benefits of immortality.

291
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:38,2
"Immortality."

292
00:12:38,042 --> 00:12:39,5
Mm, of course, uh,

293
00:12:39,076 --> 00:12:41,2
you spell that
with one or two M's?

294
00:12:41,042 --> 00:12:43,0
I always forget.

295
00:12:43,022 --> 00:12:45,1
What will your corrupt little
organization do about this?

296
00:12:45,034 --> 00:12:47,3
Excuse me?

297
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,8
Will you find
the person responsible?

298
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:49,8
Will they be punished?

299
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,5
Will this be a priority for you?

300
00:12:51,073 --> 00:12:53,1
Because it is for me.

301
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,1
You got some balls
on you, pal.

302
00:12:55,035 --> 00:12:57,1
Oh, thank you very much, but
they're really quite average.

303
00:12:57,031 --> 00:12:58,6
I bet.

304
00:12:58,086 --> 00:13:00,3
Now, are you sure
that we haven't met?

305
00:13:00,057 --> 00:13:02,2
I could swear
I've seen you naked.

306
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:03,3
Have we had sex?

309
00:13:08,003 --> 00:13:09,2
Someone out there
needs to be punished.

310
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,5

Now, what do you want?
I'm a little busy.

Well, I can't believe
that you're getting married

337
00:14:13,043 --> 00:14:15,8
the day after your ex-fiancée
and once brightest star

338
00:14:16,006 --> 00:14:17,6
was murdered in cold blood.

JIMMY: Yeah,
that's very sad.

340
00:14:19,052 --> 00:14:21,3
But you know what,
she ruined my wedding once.

341
00:14:21,052 --> 00:14:22,9
I'm not about to let
that happen again.

342

JIMMY:
What?

345
00:14:27,045 --> 00:14:28,7
Well, you tried
to get her back recently.

346
00:14:28,099 --> 00:14:30,4
I mean, I'd kill someone
if they denied me once.

347
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,9
Not that that's possible.

348
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,5
So, come on,
what do you say, Jimbo, huh?

349
00:14:34,075 --> 00:14:36,2
Did you want her dead?

Look, stop looking at me
that way, you freak.

351
00:14:39,021 --> 00:14:41,0
I am not playing that
mind game with you.

No, of course not!

353
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,8
I was furious and
I was humiliated

354
00:14:44,005 --> 00:14:45,8
when she dumped me,
but I think, I-I think

355
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:47,6
I've rebounded pretty well.

356
00:14:47,088 --> 00:14:49,8

They were always fighting.

362

He slapped her
around a bunch.

363
00:14:59,052 --> 00:15:01,4
He surrounds himself with
gun-toting morons 24-7.

364
00:15:01,069 --> 00:15:03,4
He is the real deal.

365

have sex with him tonight.

370
00:15:15,058 --> 00:15:17,3
(congregation gasping)

371
00:15:17,058 --> 00:15:19,1
Oh, my...

372
00:15:19,037 --> 00:15:20,6
I'm sorry, I...

373
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,1
I can't believe
I just said that.

374
00:15:22,038 --> 00:15:23,8
LUCIFER: Oh, no, no, no.
Let's be honest here.

375
00:15:24,004 --> 00:15:25,6
I mean, you're not
marrying this human stain

376
00:15:25,088 --> 00:15:27,7
'cause you're actually
in love with him, right?

377
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,0
- God no.
- No.

378
00:15:29,022 --> 00:15:30,1
Right.

379
00:15:30,038 --> 00:15:31,5
(claps)
Well, I should get going.

380
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,0
Ooh!

381
00:15:33,022 --> 00:15:35,3
Best of luck
with you crazy kids, all right?

382
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,7

Yes, I'm here to see the man

389
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,2
sadly known as 2Vile--
is he in?

390
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:00,2
I'm sorry, sir.
He's unavailable.

391
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:01,8
He's in mourning, I'm afraid.

392
00:16:02,008 --> 00:16:04,0
Right.
I have narcotics for him.

Can someone please turn down
this god-awful music!

399
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:23,4
Hello, disc jockey!

400
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,4
Thank you.

401
00:16:25,065 --> 00:16:27,0
Who's this clown?

402
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:29,0
He has narcotics
for you, sir.

403
00:16:29,028 --> 00:16:32,2
My name is Lucifer Morningstar.

404
00:16:32,045 --> 00:16:34,3
"Lucifer Morningstar"?

405
00:16:34,053 --> 00:16:35,7
(laughs)

406
00:16:35,099 --> 00:16:37,6
Now, that's a good hip-hop name.

407
00:16:37,087 --> 00:16:38,9
Well, that offends me.

408
00:16:39,016 --> 00:16:42,1
What, you don't like hip-hop?

409
00:16:42,037 --> 00:16:43,6
No, I most certainly do not.

410
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:46,3
Well, that offends me.

411
00:16:48,067 --> 00:16:50,9
You have a problem
with black people?

412
00:16:51,013 --> 00:16:52,0
No, not in the slightest.

413
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,2
I just hate your music.

414
00:16:53,047 --> 00:16:55,0
(laughs)
And when I say

415
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,6
"your music,"
I mean your music.

416
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,6
Not the music made
by other black people.

417
00:16:58,085 --> 00:17:01,3
Without the blues, there'd be
no devil's music whatsoever.

418
00:17:01,052 --> 00:17:03,2
There are, of course,
many giants in the field.

419
00:17:03,048 --> 00:17:04,8
Just not you--
am I being clear?

420
00:17:05,002 --> 00:17:06,4
(chuckles) Yeah, you're
being clear all right.

421
00:17:06,065 --> 00:17:08,4
- Good.
- If you're looking

422
00:17:08,065 --> 00:17:09,8
to get yourself killed.

423
00:17:10,007 --> 00:17:13,3
(guns clicking)

424
00:17:13,057 --> 00:17:15,4
Yes, well, don't waste
your munitions-- I'm immortal.

425
00:17:16,053 --> 00:17:17,9
Tell me about Delilah.

426
00:17:18,016 --> 00:17:19,7
You ain't seen the news?

427
00:17:19,095 --> 00:17:21,4
Bitch is dead.

428
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,0
(others gasping, murmuring)

429
00:17:25,021 --> 00:17:26,8
(gunshots)

430
00:17:28,084 --> 00:17:29,9
Don't shoot, you idiot!

431
00:17:31,071 --> 00:17:33,3
- I didn't kill her.
- Why should I believe you?

432
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:35,2
Because I loved the girl.

433
00:17:35,047 --> 00:17:37,0
People sometimes kill people
with whom they're in love.

434
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:38,9
The heart's mysterious.

435
00:17:39,018 --> 00:17:40,6
- So I'm told.
- Ain't like that.

436
00:17:40,089 --> 00:17:43,0
Girl made me crazy!

437
00:17:43,027 --> 00:17:44,6
Women can do that.

438
00:17:44,089 --> 00:17:46,0
Doesn't mean you should
beat them up, does it?

439
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,0
We worked that out
a long time ago.

440
00:17:48,023 --> 00:17:50,2
I hit her once 'cause I found
out she was cheating on me.

441
00:17:57,053 --> 00:17:58,6
All right.

442
00:17:58,082 --> 00:17:59,9
With whom?

443
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,2
I don't know.
I don't know.

444
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,5
She wouldn't tell me,
all right?

445
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:03,8
Said it was a big secret,

446
00:18:04,008 --> 00:18:06,3
some-some, uh, rich married guy.

447
00:18:06,058 --> 00:18:08,2
Well, does she have a friend
that she might've confided in?

448
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:09,5
She didn't trust no one, man.

449
00:18:09,075 --> 00:18:11,1
Uh, uh, her therapist.

450
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:13,0
Her therapist is probably
the only one who knows.

451
00:18:13,021 --> 00:18:15,0
She-she's some, uh, uh,
Dr. Linda

452
00:18:15,022 --> 00:18:16,5
in-in Beverly Hills.

453
00:18:16,076 --> 00:18:18,4
Saw her, like,
five times a week on the DL.

454
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:20,3
Used a fake name, everything.

455
00:18:20,055 --> 00:18:22,5
Oh, did she now?

456
00:18:22,072 --> 00:18:25,2
Well, thank you for your time.

457
00:18:25,043 --> 00:18:27,7
CHLOE:
LAPD! Guns down.

458
00:18:27,098 --> 00:18:28,9
On the floor, down!

459
00:18:29,015 --> 00:18:30,4
You two against the wall.

460
00:18:30,061 --> 00:18:32,9
Detective, welcome to the party.

461
00:18:33,015 --> 00:18:34,4
Grab the bucket,
collect the guns.

462
00:18:34,065 --> 00:18:36,4
Now!

463
00:18:36,065 --> 00:18:38,1
You sly dog,
you did listen to me.

464
00:18:38,036 --> 00:18:39,5
I ran the dead guy's cell phone.

465
00:18:39,078 --> 00:18:40,5
2Vile was the last person
he called.

466
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:42,5
Come on, man.

467
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,7
What I find
highly interesting

468
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:46,6
is how you made the
connection on your own.

469
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,2
Well, I've been busy, my dear.

470
00:18:49,042 --> 00:18:50,7
Talk to me about Delilah.

471
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,5
We've been over that one,
Detective.

472
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,0
And why you called
the shooter

473
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,8
two days before
she was murdered.

474
00:18:56,005 --> 00:18:58,2
Fine. Yeah, I called Eddie
'cause he hooks me up sometimes.

475
00:18:58,047 --> 00:18:59,7
He met Delilah through me.

476
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:01,9
Whatever.
Don't make me a killer, do it?

477
00:19:02,014 --> 00:19:04,6
No, but it does
make you a suspect.

478
00:19:04,081 --> 00:19:06,8
What, so everyone on Eddie's
phone's a suspect?

479
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,2
Are you joking?

480
00:19:08,048 --> 00:19:10,6
You gonna drag
half of Hollywood downtown.

481
00:19:10,081 --> 00:19:12,4
Be like the Oscars or something.

482
00:19:12,065 --> 00:19:14,8
Wait, aren't you
that chick from that film?

483
00:19:15,003 --> 00:19:16,6
Hmm, what's this?
What film?

484
00:19:16,086 --> 00:19:18,1
- You used to be an actress
or something, right?
- Yeah.

485
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:20,2
That teen movie--
I forget what it's called.

486
00:19:20,049 --> 00:19:22,8
Of course.
Hot Tub High School.

487
00:19:23,008 --> 00:19:24,6
That's where
I know you from.

488
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,7
Let's just stick to my
questions, shall we? So...

489
00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:26,9
The one with
the famous nude scene,

490
00:19:27,016 --> 00:19:28,5
coming out of the hot tub!

491
00:19:28,071 --> 00:19:30,1
It was, like, a complete
Fast Times rip-off.

492
00:19:30,033 --> 00:19:31,6
She was, like,
the new Phoebe Cates!

493
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:33,1
Thanks, I appreciate that.

494
00:19:33,034 --> 00:19:34,1
That was quite a nude scene.

495
00:19:34,038 --> 00:19:35,7
I have far too many bullets

496
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:37,3
in this thing
for you to still be talking.

497
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:38,9
You, we need to have a
conversation right now.

498
00:19:39,017 --> 00:19:40,8
LUCIFER: That's a waste
of time, Detective.

499
00:19:41,005 --> 00:19:42,0
I've just threatened his life--
he's not our guy.

500
00:19:42,026 --> 00:19:43,3
He would've said, trust me.

501
00:19:43,055 --> 00:19:45,4
You did what?

502
00:19:45,068 --> 00:19:47,6
Yeah, isn't that illegal?

503
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:49,4
Uh, little bit, yeah.

504
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:50,8
You stay put.

505
00:19:51,002 --> 00:19:51,9
You, you're coming with me.

506
00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:53,5
What? Ooh.
(laughs)

507
00:19:53,077 --> 00:19:55,3
With pleasure.

508
00:19:55,052 --> 00:19:57,1
At least, perhaps now,
you'll listen to me.

509
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,6
Although, I'm not quite sure
why I'm being arrested.

510
00:19:59,082 --> 00:20:02,0
Because you're interfering
with a police investigation.

511
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,4
You've broken I can't
even count how many laws.

512
00:20:04,062 --> 00:20:05,6
And you pissed me off.

513
00:20:05,087 --> 00:20:07,1
Right, I can get
out of these, you know?

514
00:20:07,033 --> 00:20:08,2
Funny.

515
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,0
How'd you do that?

516
00:20:12,021 --> 00:20:13,5
(sighs)
Come on, we're wasting time.

517
00:20:13,075 --> 00:20:15,0
We should be out there
solving a homicide

518
00:20:15,021 --> 00:20:17,0
and punishing those responsible.

519
00:20:17,021 --> 00:20:18,3
"We"?
You're insane.

520
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:20,3
I'm taking you in.
Get in the car.

521
00:20:20,055 --> 00:20:21,5
No, that's boring.

522
00:20:21,072 --> 00:20:23,0
Not to mention pointless.

523
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:24,8
Come on, I'll help you.
It'll be fun.

524
00:20:25,005 --> 00:20:26,4
How could you possibly help me?

525
00:20:26,068 --> 00:20:27,7
I have a certain skill set.

526
00:20:27,097 --> 00:20:29,8
I can be very persuasive
with people

527
00:20:30,006 --> 00:20:32,2
and tend to see things
that others cannot.

528
00:20:32,044 --> 00:20:34,0
So, you're psychic or something?

529
00:20:34,023 --> 00:20:36,5
No, I can't read people's minds.
I'm not a Jedi.

530
00:20:36,077 --> 00:20:38,0
People just like
to tell me things.

531
00:20:38,023 --> 00:20:39,8
Hmm, just-just tell you things?

532
00:20:40,007 --> 00:20:41,5
Just confess their sins,
just like that?

533
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,9
No, not their sins.

534
00:20:43,016 --> 00:20:44,2
I have no power
over people's sins.

535
00:20:44,045 --> 00:20:45,7
I actually get
a bad rap for that.

536
00:20:45,095 --> 00:20:47,3
I have the ability

537
00:20:47,053 --> 00:20:49,4
to draw out people's
forbidden desires.

538
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,8
The more simple the human,

539
00:20:51,004 --> 00:20:52,2
the easier it is.

540
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,4
The more complex,
the more challenging

541
00:20:53,062 --> 00:20:54,9
and exciting, really.

542
00:20:55,013 --> 00:20:57,3
But no, the actual sins,
the sins are on you people.

543
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:58,7
"You people"?

544
00:20:59,071 --> 00:21:00,8
I got it.

545
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,5
I got it! The name?

546
00:21:02,076 --> 00:21:03,9
The whole Lucifer thing?

547
00:21:04,018 --> 00:21:05,7
And desire's, like,
your superpower.

548
00:21:05,093 --> 00:21:08,1
Mm, it's more like
a gift from God really.

549
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:10,3
Okay, look.

550
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,8
Tell me, Detective,

551
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:16,0
what do you desire more than
anything else in this life?

552
00:21:16,027 --> 00:21:18,7
This is it?
This is your big trick?

553
00:21:24,095 --> 00:21:26,5
(sighs)

554
00:21:26,074 --> 00:21:28,7
I guess,
when I was a little girl,

555
00:21:28,095 --> 00:21:32,5
I... always wanted to be a cop
like my daddy,

556
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:36,7
so that... that one day
I could help people and...

557
00:21:36,096 --> 00:21:38,2
and be taken seriously...

558
00:21:39,088 --> 00:21:42,7
...when I say to shut up
and get in the damn car.

559
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:49,2
You're not, like, a Jedi
or something, are you?

560
00:21:49,043 --> 00:21:51,4
Get in the car.

561
00:21:51,064 --> 00:21:52,6
No, no, no, no, no.
Look.

562
00:21:52,085 --> 00:21:53,8
I know something you don't know.

563
00:21:54,006 --> 00:21:55,6
Really? What's that?

564
00:21:55,081 --> 00:21:57,2
Won't say unless you
take me with you on this.

565
00:21:57,044 --> 00:22:00,7
Please, come on.
I got to 2Vile, didn't I?

566
00:22:00,098 --> 00:22:02,4
Why do you care
about this so much?

567
00:22:02,065 --> 00:22:03,5
About Delilah?

568
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:08,8
Look, I just... I just do.

569
00:22:09,007 --> 00:22:10,5
Look, if I hadn't meddled
with her career,

570
00:22:10,074 --> 00:22:12,8
maybe she wouldn't
have died.

571
00:22:13,008 --> 00:22:13,9
Okay.

572
00:22:14,012 --> 00:22:15,4
Okay, fine--
but if this

573
00:22:15,066 --> 00:22:17,4
little clue thing of yours
doesn't pan out,

574
00:22:17,067 --> 00:22:19,7
these are going back on,
and they're gonna stay on.

575
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,0
Is that a promise?

576
00:22:29,005 --> 00:22:30,1
CHLOE: Yeah, therapist
in Beverly Hills

577
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:31,3
with the first name Linda.

578
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,7
See if Delilah
was a client.

579
00:22:32,097 --> 00:22:34,1
Ah-ah, actually,
she had a pseudonym,

580
00:22:34,031 --> 00:22:35,4
which I also
happen to know.

581
00:22:35,064 --> 00:22:36,7
I'm quite good
at this, aren't I?

582
00:22:36,098 --> 00:22:39,6
Uh, Penny Lane.
Okay.

583
00:22:39,081 --> 00:22:41,6
Delilah may have gone
by Penny Lane. Thanks.

584
00:22:45,011 --> 00:22:46,2
Don't look so smug.

585
00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:47,4
Nothing's
panned out yet.

586
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:49,0
No, no, no, it's not that.

587
00:22:49,028 --> 00:22:50,4
It's just that I knew
that I recognized you.

588
00:22:50,062 --> 00:22:51,8
Right.

589
00:22:52,008 --> 00:22:53,5
Right, you've seen my boobies.

590
00:22:53,074 --> 00:22:54,5
It's exciting.

591
00:22:54,075 --> 00:22:55,6
What, are you 12?

592
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,2
So is the, uh... is the movie

593
00:22:57,046 --> 00:22:58,4
why you've got such
a chip on your shoulder?

594
00:22:59,092 --> 00:23:01,3
Uh, it's low on the list

595
00:23:01,054 --> 00:23:02,9
- of things I have
to live down, I guess.
- Right.

596
00:23:03,017 --> 00:23:05,3
Attractive female cop
struggling to be taken seriously

597
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:06,9
in a man's man's world--
that it?

598
00:23:07,013 --> 00:23:09,5
Yeah, something like that.

599
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,3
Well, they're
threatened.

600
00:23:11,055 --> 00:23:13,8
You're clearly smart
and have notable instincts.

601
00:23:14,001 --> 00:23:15,3
Ignore them. Trust yourself.

602
00:23:16,077 --> 00:23:17,9
(cell phone rings)

603
00:23:18,014 --> 00:23:20,6
Detective Decker.

604
00:23:20,085 --> 00:23:21,9
All right,
text it to me.

605
00:23:22,011 --> 00:23:23,4
Thanks.

606
00:23:23,061 --> 00:23:24,9
What's that?

607
00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:26,3
(sighs)

608
00:23:26,053 --> 00:23:27,9
What you were
saying stands up.

609
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,3
There's a Penny
Lane who sees

610
00:23:29,053 --> 00:23:30,9
a Dr. Linda Martin
in Beverly Hills.

611
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,2
Excellent.
I'll clear my schedule.

612
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:34,5
(cell phone rings)

613
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,5
Ooh, someone's popular.

614
00:23:35,074 --> 00:23:36,5
Please stop talking.

615
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:38,5
Hello.

616
00:23:38,071 --> 00:23:40,0
What? You're kidding me.
Is she okay?

617
00:23:41,075 --> 00:23:43,4
Oh, of course he's not there.

618
00:23:43,067 --> 00:23:44,8
Thanks.

619
00:23:45,005 --> 00:23:46,8
We got to make
a pit stop.

620
00:23:47,005 --> 00:23:48,3
What?
No, absolutely not.

621
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,5
My kid got into a fight.
I got to pick her up.

622
00:23:50,072 --> 00:23:52,1
What, can't she get
herself home?

623
00:23:52,034 --> 00:23:53,6
She's seven.

624
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,9
Look, I'm not here
to help you run errands.

625
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:56,4
I'm here to help you
solve a homicide.

626
00:23:56,064 --> 00:23:58,1
Really?

627
00:24:00,052 --> 00:24:03,1
("Sinister Kid"
by the Black Keys playing)

628
00:24:09,065 --> 00:24:10,6
CHLOE:
All right.

629
00:24:10,078 --> 00:24:12,1
Wait here.

630
00:24:12,036 --> 00:24:13,4
With pleasure.

631
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:15,1

Oh, dear, what will
become of me?

641
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:58,4
My mother is
a police officer.

642
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:00,2
She could arrest you.

643
00:25:00,045 --> 00:25:01,5
(lighter snaps shut)

644
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:04,0
Oh, I think I might
know your mother.

645
00:25:04,029 --> 00:25:05,5
What's your name?

646
00:25:05,075 --> 00:25:07,2
Lucifer.

647
00:25:07,046 --> 00:25:09,0
(whispering):
Like the Devil?

648
00:25:09,025 --> 00:25:10,8
Exactly.

649
00:25:11,005 --> 00:25:14,7
My name's Beatrice, but
everybody calls me Trixie.

650
00:25:14,093 --> 00:25:16,7
That's a hooker's name.

651
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:18,0
What's a hooker?

652
00:25:18,026 --> 00:25:20,0
Ask your mother.

653
00:25:20,027 --> 00:25:23,1
So... why are you
in trouble?

654
00:25:23,031 --> 00:25:25,1
See that girl
over there?

655
00:25:26,073 --> 00:25:27,9
She was bullying me.

656
00:25:28,011 --> 00:25:29,5
She created a fake
Snapchat account

657
00:25:29,077 --> 00:25:31,3
and used it to
make fun of me.

658
00:25:31,053 --> 00:25:35,6
So... I kicked her in the
no-no-touch-touch square.

659
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:39,2
Oh. Oh, I see.

660
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:42,1
Well played.

661
00:25:42,033 --> 00:25:43,5
Well played, indeed.

662
00:25:46,096 --> 00:25:48,1
Hello, mean girl.

663
00:25:49,096 --> 00:25:52,0
Did you know there's a
special section of Hell

664
00:25:52,026 --> 00:25:53,1
reserved for bullies?

665
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:55,4
So have fun.

666
00:25:57,059 --> 00:25:58,8
(screams)

667
00:26:02,006 --> 00:26:03,1
What did you do?

668
00:26:03,031 --> 00:26:05,1
Oh...

669
00:26:05,031 --> 00:26:07,5
I just think someone's feeling
a little guilty.

670
00:26:09,098 --> 00:26:11,7
(school bell rings)

671
00:26:16,049 --> 00:26:17,7
Hi, Daddy.

672
00:26:17,099 --> 00:26:19,1
Hi, munchkin.

673
00:26:19,032 --> 00:26:20,3
CHLOE: Wow, shocker,
you're late.

674
00:26:20,053 --> 00:26:21,4
Come on, give
me a break.

675
00:26:21,066 --> 00:26:22,8
I'm putting
a case to bed.

676
00:26:23,008 --> 00:26:24,2
Right, like I'm not
working a case, too.

677
00:26:24,045 --> 00:26:26,8
Oh, yeah, the one
you tried to steal from me.

678
00:26:27,004 --> 00:26:28,2
You mean the open and shut one.

679
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:31,3
You did open and shut it, right?

680
00:26:31,055 --> 00:26:33,3
I'm being diligent, Dan.
It's a high-profile case.

681
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:35,1
Exactly, which is why you
need to be smart about it.

682
00:26:35,034 --> 00:26:37,0
She is smart.
You're the dimwit.

683
00:26:37,022 --> 00:26:40,0
Perhaps you should refrain from
arguing in front of the child.

684
00:26:40,026 --> 00:26:41,1
It's unbecoming.

685
00:26:42,085 --> 00:26:44,6
I don't know whether to laugh
or to shoot you.

686
00:26:44,081 --> 00:26:46,5
Surprise me.

687
00:26:46,073 --> 00:26:49,1
Isn't he funny, Daddy?

688
00:26:49,027 --> 00:26:50,6
CHLOE: Hey, can you, uh,
drop Trix at my mom's?

689
00:26:50,081 --> 00:26:52,1
We got to go. Thank you.

690
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,1
Trixella, give
Mommy a kiss.

691
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,1
I love you so much.

692
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,8
Good job standing up
to the mean girl.

693
00:26:58,007 --> 00:26:59,2
Thanks, Mommy.

694
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:01,0
What's a hooker?

695
00:27:04,054 --> 00:27:05,8
Daddy will tell you.

696
00:27:10,071 --> 00:27:11,8
Bye, Lucifer.

697
00:27:12,009 --> 00:27:13,2
It was nice meeting you.

698
00:27:14,063 --> 00:27:15,9
CHLOE:
Hmm.

699
00:27:16,017 --> 00:27:17,3
Think she likes you.

700
00:27:17,059 --> 00:27:19,0
Of course she does--
what's not to like?

701
00:27:29,098 --> 00:27:32,1
Was your offspring
planned or a mistake?

702
00:27:34,015 --> 00:27:35,3
Planned, sort of.

703
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:37,2
Really?

704
00:27:37,044 --> 00:27:38,6
'Cause I've never understood
the human desire to procreate.

705
00:27:38,086 --> 00:27:40,2
That's probably
a good thing.

706
00:27:40,045 --> 00:27:41,9
I mean, children are
hideous little creatures,

707
00:27:42,012 --> 00:27:43,4
terrible, taxing burdens.

708
00:27:43,062 --> 00:27:45,4
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

709
00:27:45,062 --> 00:27:47,1
Oh, um, yours is fine.

710
00:27:47,037 --> 00:27:49,5
I mean, you know,
nothing to crow about,

711
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:51,0
but nothing to be too
embarrassed about, either,

712
00:27:51,029 --> 00:27:52,7
so that's quite good, isn't it?

713
00:27:52,092 --> 00:27:55,2
Are you at all aware
of how dickish you sound?

714
00:27:55,042 --> 00:27:56,2
No.

715
00:27:57,059 --> 00:28:00,5
Speaking of dicks...

716
00:28:00,072 --> 00:28:02,0
why was that ex-husband of yours

717
00:28:02,026 --> 00:28:03,5
pressuring you
to close the case?

718
00:28:05,047 --> 00:28:07,3
No reason.

719
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:09,4
Strange.

720
00:28:09,068 --> 00:28:11,0
Yes, you are.

721
00:28:12,081 --> 00:28:14,3
Did my father send you?

722
00:28:14,052 --> 00:28:15,8
(door opens)

723
00:28:16,002 --> 00:28:18,5
Okay, Detectives,
I'll see you now.

724
00:28:18,074 --> 00:28:19,9
CHLOE:
Thank you.

725
00:28:20,011 --> 00:28:21,3
Oh. "Detectives."

726
00:28:22,095 --> 00:28:24,4
CHLOE: Dr. Martin,
I'd like to ask you

727
00:28:24,066 --> 00:28:26,1
a few questions
about Delilah.

728
00:28:31,004 --> 00:28:33,3
You're thinking
about it, aren't you?

729
00:28:33,058 --> 00:28:34,5
What?

730
00:28:34,075 --> 00:28:35,7
Yes, I wouldn't
recommend it.

731
00:28:35,092 --> 00:28:37,0
I'm like walking heroin.

732
00:28:37,025 --> 00:28:39,0
Very habit-forming.
It never ends well.

733
00:28:39,026 --> 00:28:40,6
(sighs)

734
00:28:40,084 --> 00:28:42,7
I'm sorry, do... do you two
know each other?

735
00:28:42,093 --> 00:28:44,5
No, no, but I know that look.

736
00:28:44,076 --> 00:28:47,2
I don't know
what you're talking about.

737
00:28:48,043 --> 00:28:49,8
That is interesting

738
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:52,3
'cause... you don't
look at me that way.

739
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,4
- What way?
- With carnal fascination.

740
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,4
That's 'cause
it doesn't exist.

741
00:28:56,061 --> 00:28:58,0
No, you see, that's just it--
with most women, it does.

742
00:28:58,027 --> 00:28:59,9
I tend to appeal to the
dark, mischievous hearts

743
00:29:00,011 --> 00:29:03,1
in all of you, but
you, Detective,

744
00:29:03,036 --> 00:29:05,2
you seem oddly
immune to my charms.

745
00:29:05,045 --> 00:29:08,2
Referring to them as "charms,"
I think, is a bit of a stretch.

746
00:29:08,045 --> 00:29:09,9
Truth be told,
I find you repulsive.

747
00:29:10,012 --> 00:29:11,5
Like, on a
chemical level.

748
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:12,7
That's fascinating.

749
00:29:14,042 --> 00:29:15,5
LUCIFER:
Now, tell me, Linda...

750
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:17,4
You say it's fascinating,

751
00:29:17,063 --> 00:29:20,2
and yet I can see that it
disturbs you, doesn't it?

752
00:29:20,046 --> 00:29:22,7
Deeply.

753
00:29:22,097 --> 00:29:24,5
CHLOE:
Dr. Martin,

754
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,7
we know that, um, Delilah was
having a clandestine affair

755
00:29:26,093 --> 00:29:28,5
with a wealthy married man,
so if you just

756
00:29:28,076 --> 00:29:30,6
tell us his name,
we will be on our way.

757
00:29:30,081 --> 00:29:32,6
I'm sorry, I can't do that.

758
00:29:32,077 --> 00:29:34,2
Oh, she's one of
the complex ones.

759
00:29:34,044 --> 00:29:35,7
Linda,

760
00:29:35,094 --> 00:29:38,1
darling, why don't
you tell me? Hmm?

761
00:29:38,031 --> 00:29:39,1
Well, I can't.

762
00:29:39,032 --> 00:29:40,2
(Lucifer chuckles)

763
00:29:40,048 --> 00:29:42,7
I want to, but I can't.

764
00:29:42,099 --> 00:29:44,2
(laughs)

765
00:29:44,045 --> 00:29:46,2
(laughing):
Oh, you're the devil.

766
00:29:46,041 --> 00:29:48,4
(chuckles)
Correct.

767
00:29:48,066 --> 00:29:50,1
Now, come on, Dr. Martin.

768
00:29:50,033 --> 00:29:51,7
I know you want to.

769
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,7
Oh, man, and it's really,
really juicy, too.

770
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,9
Ooh, I bet it is.

771
00:29:56,012 --> 00:29:57,2
No, I can't.

772
00:29:57,046 --> 00:29:58,5
What did you do to her?

773
00:29:58,079 --> 00:29:59,8
Did you roofie her?

774
00:30:00,004 --> 00:30:01,1
Oh, no, it's
not her fault.

775
00:30:01,034 --> 00:30:02,2
She's just
reacting to me.

776
00:30:02,046 --> 00:30:04,3
Just watch
and learn, okay?

777
00:30:04,047 --> 00:30:05,6
Right, the answer is yes,

778
00:30:05,084 --> 00:30:07,9
we can take a trip
to pound town if we must,

779
00:30:08,018 --> 00:30:11,9
but first, you're gonna have
to tell us, Linda, okay?

780
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:13,6
(moaning):
Um...

781
00:30:13,085 --> 00:30:16,3
(chuckles)

782
00:30:16,052 --> 00:30:20,0
Okay... (chuckles)
it's Grey Cooper.

783
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:21,7
Grey Cooper?

784
00:30:21,094 --> 00:30:22,9
Seriously?

785
00:30:23,011 --> 00:30:24,3
That is juicy.

786
00:30:24,057 --> 00:30:26,1
Grey Cooper, the actor?

787
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:27,2
The one who's married
to Amanda what's-her-chops?

788
00:30:27,049 --> 00:30:28,6
Yeah, yeah.

789
00:30:28,082 --> 00:30:30,4
Oh, no,
he's horrible.

790
00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:34,0
So square-jawed,
so handsome, so vanilla.

791
00:30:34,029 --> 00:30:35,6
Oh, I'm really quite
disappointed in Delilah.

792
00:30:35,087 --> 00:30:39,2
That's truly terrible taste
in the opposite sex.

793
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:40,5
Thank you very
much, Dr. Martin.

794
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:41,6
We'll be in touch.

795
00:30:41,088 --> 00:30:43,0
All right,
we got to go.

796
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:45,1
Yes, of course,
but I... I made a deal,

797
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:47,1
so I'm gonna have to hold up
my end of the bargain.

798
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:48,5
You wouldn't mind
waiting outside?

799
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,1
Are you seriously talking

800
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:51,9
about having sex
with her right now?

801
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:53,9
Well, it won't take long.
I do yoga.

802
00:30:55,018 --> 00:30:58,8
Hot... yoga.

803
00:30:59,006 --> 00:31:01,5
I'm freakishly flexible.

804
00:31:01,073 --> 00:31:02,8
Want to see?

805
00:31:05,065 --> 00:31:06,9
Wow!

806
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:10,8
(chuckles)

807
00:31:11,003 --> 00:31:13,5
I really tried
to keep that one in.

808
00:31:13,074 --> 00:31:16,2
Well, you tried--
that's what matters.

809
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,6
Uh, look,
I'm really sorry,

810
00:31:17,087 --> 00:31:19,6
but I'm gonna have
to take a rain check.

811
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:20,7
I will be back, okay?

812
00:31:20,096 --> 00:31:21,9
I certainly hope so.

813
00:31:23,004 --> 00:31:25,0
My word is my bond.

Ah, excuse me. Thank you.

819
00:31:39,027 --> 00:31:41,4
Hey, hey, sir.

820
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,5
(tires squealing, gunfire)

821
00:31:48,007 --> 00:31:50,4
Who the (bell rings)
is this guy?

822
00:31:50,061 --> 00:31:52,8
What the hell are you doing?

823
00:31:53,003 --> 00:31:54,0
CHLOE: Excuse me.
Excuse me.

824
00:31:54,024 --> 00:31:55,4
Sorry. Excuse me.

825
00:31:55,062 --> 00:31:57,6
Sorry, he's with me.

826
00:31:58,091 --> 00:32:01,0
That's not Grey Cooper.

827
00:32:01,025 --> 00:32:02,3
No, of course not.

828
00:32:02,058 --> 00:32:03,6
What the hell is this?

829
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:05,5
We need to speak
with Mr. Cooper.

830
00:32:09,009 --> 00:32:11,2
God, Delilah, yeah,
heard about that this morning.

831
00:32:11,047 --> 00:32:12,5
I can't believe it.

832
00:32:12,072 --> 00:32:14,6
We did a movie
together last year.

833
00:32:14,089 --> 00:32:15,7
Got pretty close.

834
00:32:15,097 --> 00:32:17,8
- Lovers?
- Friends.

835
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:19,4
Friends who were lovers?

836
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,5
CHLOE:
Settle down.

837
00:32:20,077 --> 00:32:22,2
I'll handle
the questions.

838
00:32:22,048 --> 00:32:23,9
Mr. Cooper, when did you last
have contact with Delilah?

839
00:32:24,011 --> 00:32:25,4
Well, actually, I just
have one more question

840
00:32:25,065 --> 00:32:26,9
before you proceed
with the boring ones.

841
00:32:27,015 --> 00:32:29,6
Tell me, Mr. Cooper,

842
00:32:29,082 --> 00:32:31,8
what do you want more
than anything in this world?

843
00:32:32,007 --> 00:32:33,8
What's your deepest,
darkest desire?

844
00:32:34,007 --> 00:32:37,2
You close your eyes,
what do you see?

845
00:32:37,041 --> 00:32:41,6
I'm the president of the
United States of America.

846
00:32:41,087 --> 00:32:42,7
Ha!

847
00:32:44,063 --> 00:32:46,0
Well, who's the Devil now, eh?

848
00:32:46,029 --> 00:32:48,1
Those are some pretty big
aspirations there,

849
00:32:48,034 --> 00:32:50,5
- Mr. Cooper.
- (chuckles)
Well, after the acting

850
00:32:50,072 --> 00:32:52,4
- and stuff.
- No need

851
00:32:52,063 --> 00:32:54,8
to be embarrassed. Hell,
if Arnold can do it, right?

852
00:32:55,001 --> 00:32:56,7
- (chuckles)
- Now, you wouldn't
want any nasty secrets

853
00:32:56,097 --> 00:32:58,2
screwing that up for you,
though, would you?

854
00:32:58,047 --> 00:32:59,8
Is there a point to this?

855
00:33:00,006 --> 00:33:02,3
Mr. Cooper, were you having
an affair with Delilah?

856
00:33:02,052 --> 00:33:03,6
AMANDA:
Honey!

857
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:05,1
Have you been
getting my texts?

858
00:33:05,036 --> 00:33:06,4
I thought they were
breaking you for lunch

859
00:33:06,061 --> 00:33:07,6
like a half hour ago.

860
00:33:08,082 --> 00:33:09,6
What's going on?

861
00:33:09,086 --> 00:33:12,1
These people are detectives.

862
00:33:12,036 --> 00:33:13,4
Real ones?

863
00:33:13,061 --> 00:33:15,2
We have some questions
about Delilah.

864
00:33:15,049 --> 00:33:17,3
Oh. Oh. Yes, it's so sad.

865
00:33:17,058 --> 00:33:18,6
Yeah. Very sad.

866
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,0
Your watch,
where'd you get that?

867
00:33:22,016 --> 00:33:23,5
Oh, it's a prop.

868
00:33:23,071 --> 00:33:24,6
AMANDA:
No, that's the one

869
00:33:24,087 --> 00:33:25,7
Delilah gave you, isn't it?

870
00:33:25,096 --> 00:33:26,9
For Time Will Tell?

871
00:33:27,017 --> 00:33:29,3
GREY: Right.
That's the movie

872
00:33:29,055 --> 00:33:31,6
that we did.
It was a wrap gift.

873
00:33:31,088 --> 00:33:34,0
(chuckles)
Yeah. She buy a $10,000 watch

874
00:33:34,022 --> 00:33:35,5
for the whole crew?
Uh, no.

875
00:33:35,072 --> 00:33:37,7
Just me, as far as I know.

876
00:33:37,093 --> 00:33:40,0
'Cause we were,
you know,

877
00:33:40,022 --> 00:33:41,9
costars and everything.

878
00:33:42,018 --> 00:33:43,9
You know, you're gonna have
to get much better at lying

879
00:33:44,019 --> 00:33:45,3
if you want to be president.

880
00:33:45,052 --> 00:33:47,6
I know, right?

881
00:33:47,086 --> 00:33:49,5
So you were sleeping
with her, then, yeah?

882
00:33:50,098 --> 00:33:52,8
- Oh, yeah. (chuckles)
- (laughing)

883
00:33:58,066 --> 00:34:00,3
Crap. I just said that
in front of people.

884
00:34:00,058 --> 00:34:02,0
Whatever.
It's not like I didn't know.

885
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,6
God, you are a
terrible liar.

886
00:34:03,087 --> 00:34:05,0
And actor, by the way.

887
00:34:05,025 --> 00:34:06,8
You knew?
Of course.

888
00:34:07,004 --> 00:34:09,8
Why else do you think I've been
sleeping with Bobby?

889
00:34:10,009 --> 00:34:11,0
Are you serious?

890
00:34:11,025 --> 00:34:13,0
Oh, yeah. And it is good.

891
00:34:13,026 --> 00:34:15,5
Mmm. I climb that man
like a tree.

892
00:34:15,076 --> 00:34:16,5
Right, Bobby?

893
00:34:16,076 --> 00:34:18,2
GREY:
My bodyguard?

894
00:34:18,043 --> 00:34:20,1
What a cliché.

895
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:22,2
Oh, I'm a cliché?
Well, you're a dick.

896
00:34:22,043 --> 00:34:23,2
Oh, boy.

897
00:34:24,089 --> 00:34:26,3
- Hey, guys...
- Come on!

898
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:29,0
Hey, guys. Arrest them.

899
00:34:29,027 --> 00:34:31,2
- Seriously?
- (grunting)

900
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,3
One of them's got
to be guilty.

901
00:34:39,053 --> 00:34:41,5
♪♪

902
00:34:41,074 --> 00:34:45,3
♪ Hit me point-blank,
hit me point-blank ♪

903
00:34:45,054 --> 00:34:47,1

904
00:34:47,037 --> 00:34:49,6
Thanks.
(sighs)

905
00:34:49,088 --> 00:34:54,0
So, Grey and Amanda have
zero connection to the shooter.

906
00:34:54,026 --> 00:34:56,8
(sighs)
But the shooter had
the same watch as Grey.

907
00:34:57,009 --> 00:34:58,7
That can't be a coincidence.

908
00:34:58,097 --> 00:35:03,3
Maybe Delilah gave him one, too,
like kind of a go-to gift. I...

909
00:35:03,056 --> 00:35:04,7
Well, that would imply
she was actually

910
00:35:04,097 --> 00:35:05,8
sleeping with that maggot.

911
00:35:06,006 --> 00:35:07,6
Really?

912
00:35:07,089 --> 00:35:10,6
Jimmy, 2Vile,
Grey Cooper.

913
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:12,6
That's three other maggots
she's sleeping with.

914
00:35:12,086 --> 00:35:14,4
I don't think there's a lot
of discretion going on with her.

915
00:35:14,061 --> 00:35:15,5
Yeah. I suppose you got a point.

916
00:35:16,074 --> 00:35:18,0
(chuckles softly)

917
00:35:18,024 --> 00:35:20,2
God, what am I doing here?

918
00:35:20,041 --> 00:35:22,8
Wrong deity, but, yes,
that is the eternal question.

919
00:35:23,003 --> 00:35:25,6
(chuckles)
No. I mean here, in a bar,

920
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:26,8
- with you.
- Well, I don't know.

921
00:35:27,008 --> 00:35:28,7
You tell me, Detective.

922
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:31,0
I mean, despite
your proclaimed revulsion,

923
00:35:31,025 --> 00:35:33,7
you can't deny that
there's a connection between us.

924
00:35:33,092 --> 00:35:36,6
Tell me, what do
you actually want?

925
00:35:36,084 --> 00:35:39,7
You mean what do I desire
more than anything else

926
00:35:39,093 --> 00:35:41,6
- in this life?
- Yes.

927
00:35:41,089 --> 00:35:43,5
- Mm-hmm.
- No tricks. Not that they work
on you, you freak.

928
00:35:43,076 --> 00:35:44,7
(chuckles)

929
00:35:45,093 --> 00:35:48,4
Seriously. I'm curious.

930
00:35:48,064 --> 00:35:49,9
I don't know.

931
00:35:50,019 --> 00:35:51,7
What-what I told you's true.

932
00:35:51,094 --> 00:35:54,6
I-I really do want
to help people.

933
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:57,3
My father was a cop.

934
00:35:57,057 --> 00:35:58,9
He was a great cop.

935
00:35:59,011 --> 00:36:00,7
My mother was an actress.

936
00:36:00,095 --> 00:36:02,2
Really cheesy one.
(chuckles)

937
00:36:02,045 --> 00:36:05,4
I tried the acting thing.
I took off my top.

938
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:07,8
Wasn't really contributing
to the betterment of society.

939
00:36:08,008 --> 00:36:10,0
I disagree. I love that movie.

940
00:36:10,025 --> 00:36:11,2
(chuckles)

941
00:36:11,046 --> 00:36:12,5
So I quit.

942
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,6
Decided to become a cop
like my dad

943
00:36:14,084 --> 00:36:16,7
and, uh, dealt with the whole
Hot Tub High School thing,

944
00:36:16,092 --> 00:36:18,4
until, um,

945
00:36:18,067 --> 00:36:20,6
I became a detective
and found a whole new way

946
00:36:20,088 --> 00:36:23,0
- to ostracize myself.
- Ah, the...

947
00:36:23,026 --> 00:36:25,4
reason your ex-maggot
was pressuring you

948
00:36:25,068 --> 00:36:27,1
to close this?

949
00:36:27,031 --> 00:36:28,6
Yeah. Yeah.

950
00:36:28,089 --> 00:36:30,8
Exactly. There was a case,

951
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:33,7
a shooting on Palmetto Street
where a cop was shot,

952
00:36:33,098 --> 00:36:36,0
and I saw it differently
than pretty much everyone

953
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,1
in my department,
including my ex.

954
00:36:38,032 --> 00:36:39,8
And I stuck
my neck out,

955
00:36:40,003 --> 00:36:41,9
and it backfired.

956
00:36:42,011 --> 00:36:44,0
And, uh, now...

957
00:36:44,028 --> 00:36:46,7
(chuckles)
no one wants to work with me.

958
00:36:46,095 --> 00:36:48,6
Well, I'm available.

959
00:36:50,096 --> 00:36:52,2
Too bad your little protégé

960
00:36:52,046 --> 00:36:53,4
isn't around
to collect the check.

961
00:36:53,067 --> 00:36:54,6
REPORTER:
The soundtrack album

962
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:56,1
for the movie Time Will Tell

963
00:36:56,038 --> 00:36:58,6
has reached number 15
on the Billboard charts

964
00:36:58,084 --> 00:37:00,3
and is still climbing.
Song and record sales...

965
00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:01,6
Oh, wow.

966
00:37:02,088 --> 00:37:04,0
What?

967
00:37:06,005 --> 00:37:08,1
Delilah didn't give that watch
to the drug dealer.

968
00:37:12,098 --> 00:37:15,8
♪ - Got a heavy load,
sometimes I wonder... ♪
- Stop, stop, stop!

969
00:37:16,002 --> 00:37:19,0
(music stops)
What is it? You got a gerbil in
your throat? What's going on?

970
00:37:21,061 --> 00:37:22,6
Hello, Jimmy.

971
00:37:22,086 --> 00:37:24,3
Really?

972
00:37:24,053 --> 00:37:25,9
How's the album sales doing?

973
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,9
What album?

974
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:29,7
Soundtrack to Time Will Tell,
which you produced.

975
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:33,1
Whitney Houston hit the top ten
for album sales after her death.

976
00:37:33,037 --> 00:37:35,1
Michael Jackson hit
the stratosphere.

977
00:37:35,037 --> 00:37:38,1
Not sure you'll achieve such
heights having Delilah killed,

978
00:37:38,038 --> 00:37:41,3
but that sure is a boatload of
royalty checks headed your way.

979
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:44,8
Guess you really
needed the cash, huh?

980
00:37:45,005 --> 00:37:48,1
Which is why you had to pay
the shooter with your watch.

981
00:37:48,035 --> 00:37:50,3
The watch Delilah gave you.
Now, that's just sick.

982
00:37:50,056 --> 00:37:52,0
But then you are, so...

983
00:37:53,068 --> 00:37:55,3
(gun clicks)

984
00:37:55,052 --> 00:37:56,3
Hey, Jimmy?

985
00:37:56,056 --> 00:37:57,8
I made her,
and she ruined me.

986
00:37:58,006 --> 00:38:00,8
She humiliated me.
She owes me.

987
00:38:01,007 --> 00:38:02,7
You're not God, Jimmy.
You didn't make her.

988
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,0
But you did destroy her.

989
00:38:05,024 --> 00:38:06,9
So I'm gonna punish you.

990
00:38:07,011 --> 00:38:09,5
You back off,
you freak. I mean it.

991
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:11,9
I am not going to jail
for that bitch. No chance.

992
00:38:12,012 --> 00:38:13,3
Listen to him,
Lucifer. Back off.

993
00:38:13,058 --> 00:38:15,1
I told you, it's fine.
I'm immortal.

994
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,2
Why did you do that?

995
00:38:20,042 --> 00:38:22,2
- He was gonna kill you.
- No, no, no,

996
00:38:22,046 --> 00:38:25,2
no, no, no. You just...
you just let him off too easy.

997
00:38:25,047 --> 00:38:27,2
He needs to pay!
He needs to suffer!

998
00:38:27,047 --> 00:38:28,9
He needs to feel the pain,

999
00:38:29,014 --> 00:38:31,4
- not escape it!
- Don't worry.

1000
00:38:31,064 --> 00:38:33,7
I'm sure where he's going,
the pain's coming.

1001
00:38:33,098 --> 00:38:35,6
No. No, it's not, actually.

1002
00:38:35,081 --> 00:38:37,7
And you know why?
Because I'm here and he's...

1003
00:38:37,098 --> 00:38:39,8
(gunshots)
(gasps)

1004
00:38:45,003 --> 00:38:46,4
(gasping)

1005
00:38:46,061 --> 00:38:49,1
Chloe.

1006
00:38:49,032 --> 00:38:50,4
(gasping)

1007
00:38:50,066 --> 00:38:53,1
(weakly):
I don't want to die.

1008
00:38:53,033 --> 00:38:55,7
I won't let you.

1009
00:38:57,046 --> 00:38:59,5
Your father will just have
to wait for you.

1010
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:03,1
(gunshots)
(groaning)

1011
00:39:05,021 --> 00:39:07,8
Just... give me one second.

1012
00:39:08,009 --> 00:39:10,6
(gunshots)

1013
00:39:13,093 --> 00:39:14,9
(grunts)

1014
00:39:15,014 --> 00:39:16,1
JIMMY:
No, please! No, no,

1015
00:39:16,031 --> 00:39:18,2
please! Please.

1016
00:39:18,048 --> 00:39:20,7
Please don't kill me.

1017
00:39:20,094 --> 00:39:21,9
Oh, Jimmy.

1018
00:39:24,023 --> 00:39:25,8
You're gonna wish
that's all

1019
00:39:26,003 --> 00:39:28,4
- I did to you.
- (screaming)

1020
00:39:43,025 --> 00:39:44,4
LUCIFER:
Well,

1021
00:39:44,063 --> 00:39:47,0
look who's back.

1022
00:39:49,059 --> 00:39:51,1
(groans)

1023
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,9
How long have I been out?

1024
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:58,8
(sighs)
Three years.

1025
00:39:59,098 --> 00:40:01,1
What?

1026
00:40:01,035 --> 00:40:02,2
(chuckling)

1027
00:40:04,044 --> 00:40:05,9
You're such an ass.

1028
00:40:06,015 --> 00:40:07,9
- Thank you.
- Oh, God.

1029
00:40:11,007 --> 00:40:12,5
He was firing at you.

1030
00:40:14,033 --> 00:40:15,6
Why aren't you...

1031
00:40:15,087 --> 00:40:17,5
more dead?

1032
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:19,8
You're having a very hard time
with the immortal thing,

1033
00:40:20,008 --> 00:40:22,0
aren't you?

1034
00:40:22,025 --> 00:40:23,5
(sighs)

1035
00:40:25,013 --> 00:40:27,0
- What happened with Jimmy?
- Jimmy?

1036
00:40:27,021 --> 00:40:29,5
Jimmy got what he deserved.

1037
00:40:29,072 --> 00:40:31,3
Hmm?

1038
00:40:32,084 --> 00:40:35,1
Well, I'm pretty sure
I'd be dead

1039
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:36,6
if you hadn't helped me,
so...

1040
00:40:36,085 --> 00:40:38,8
thank you.

1041
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:40,8
Sorry, what was that?
That last bit.

1042
00:40:41,006 --> 00:40:42,7
I didn't quite
get that.

1043
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:45,5
Thank you.

1044
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:48,6
You're welcome.

1045
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:50,5
And, besides, you know,

1046
00:40:50,078 --> 00:40:52,7
you're far too interesting
to let die.

1047
00:40:54,041 --> 00:40:56,3
You saved my life
because I'm interesting?

1048
00:40:56,058 --> 00:40:58,4
Wildly irritating as well,
but yes.

1049
00:40:58,062 --> 00:40:59,5
(chuckles softly)

1050
00:41:02,008 --> 00:41:03,5
So what now?

1051
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:05,0
Well, I mean,
I've obviously proven myself

1052
00:41:05,025 --> 00:41:06,4
to be an invaluable
crime-fighting tool.

1053
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:08,5
You're a pariah
in the department.

1054
00:41:08,071 --> 00:41:10,0
I think this could be the start

1055
00:41:10,021 --> 00:41:11,0
of a beautiful friendship.
Don't you?

1056
00:41:11,022 --> 00:41:13,0
Who the hell are you?

1057
00:41:13,022 --> 00:41:15,2
I told you, I'm...

1058
00:41:15,047 --> 00:41:16,8
Lucifer!

1059
00:41:17,089 --> 00:41:20,0
Uh, yes. Hello, child.

1060
00:41:20,027 --> 00:41:22,1
Um, just... Why don't you save

1061
00:41:22,039 --> 00:41:24,0
some of this unpleasantness
for your mother, yeah?

1062
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,2
- (groans)
- Ooh.

1063
00:41:25,048 --> 00:41:27,2
- Sorry.
- Oh.

1064
00:41:27,048 --> 00:41:29,4
- God.
- Are you hurt?

1065
00:41:29,061 --> 00:41:30,9
I'm okay.

1066
00:41:31,011 --> 00:41:32,7
LUCIFER: Right.
Well, I'd stay for

1067
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:34,5
the family reunion,
but it's giving me terrible IBS.

1068
00:41:34,078 --> 00:41:36,9
So, look forward
to seeing you soon, Chloe.

1069
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,0
- I don't.
- Bye, now.

1070
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:40,4

What do you want
from me?

1076
00:42:01,064 --> 00:42:03,9
I've been watching you, Lucifer.

1077
00:42:04,019 --> 00:42:05,9
- You perv.
- And I'm not sure

1078
00:42:06,015 --> 00:42:07,5
I like what I see.

1079
00:42:07,077 --> 00:42:10,2
You're showing restraint, mercy.

1080
00:42:10,048 --> 00:42:13,4
You scared I'm turning my back
on the dark side, bro?

1081
00:42:13,065 --> 00:42:17,2
Lucifer, there is a balance here
that we must maintain.

1082
00:42:17,045 --> 00:42:19,8
I strongly suggest you do
what I told you to do

1083
00:42:20,003 --> 00:42:21,2
and go back to Hell.

1084
00:42:21,049 --> 00:42:24,2
Don't threaten me, Amenadiel.

1085
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:26,9
I mean, you don't want
to start a war.

1086
00:42:27,012 --> 00:42:30,1
I would love a war.

1087
00:42:30,038 --> 00:42:32,3
(chuckling)

1088
00:42:32,051 --> 00:42:35,1
Oh, Luci.

1089
00:42:35,038 --> 00:42:38,7
My hatred for you grows stronger
with every visit.

1090
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:42,0
Well, I wouldn't have it
any other way, pal.

1091
00:42:42,022 --> 00:42:45,1
I look forward
to eating your heart one day.

1092
00:42:45,031 --> 00:42:46,6
Peace.

1093
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:54,7
(wings flapping)

1094
00:42:54,094 --> 00:42:56,8
Ugh.

1095
00:43:05,045 --> 00:43:07,3
I sense your
disapproval, Maze.

1096
00:43:07,058 --> 00:43:09,3
What is it?

1097
00:43:09,058 --> 00:43:14,8
I just can't understand
why you would save a human life.

1098
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:17,3
Well, there's...
something different about her

1099
00:43:17,055 --> 00:43:19,9
that I don't quite understand,
and it vexes me.
