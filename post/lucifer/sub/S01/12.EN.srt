Previously on Lucifer...
(phone chimes)

2
00:00:03,033 --> 00:00:04,7
Don't worry,
I'll answer for you.

3
00:00:04,092 --> 00:00:07,2
CHLOE:
He ended it with me tonight

4
00:00:07,042 --> 00:00:08,4
with a text.

5
00:00:08,067 --> 00:00:09,8
Who do you want me to kill?

6
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:11,2
Lucifer Morningstar.

7
00:00:11,042 --> 00:00:12,4
Bye-bye, Devil.

8
00:00:12,068 --> 00:00:14,1
This is
my Pentecostal coin.

9
00:00:14,034 --> 00:00:15,9
Subway token for the damned.

10
00:00:16,018 --> 00:00:18,4
It's all yours
if you don't shoot me.

11
00:00:18,068 --> 00:00:20,0
Leave the bottle.

12
00:00:21,031 --> 00:00:22,5
I had sex with your brother.

13
00:00:22,077 --> 00:00:25,1
That puts you
in my good graces how?

14
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,4
Well, I was his inside woman,

15
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:29,3
and now I'm yours.

16
00:00:29,057 --> 00:00:31,3
(gunshots)
LUCIFER:
Why is it that sometimes

17
00:00:31,057 --> 00:00:33,6
I'm immortal...

18
00:00:33,086 --> 00:00:35,5
and other times
I'm all too human?

19
00:00:37,012 --> 00:00:40,0
It appears that you
make me vulnerable.

20
00:00:42,046 --> 00:00:43,3
(men chanting)

21
00:00:49,046 --> 00:00:51,1

22
00:00:53,051 --> 00:00:54,5
MAN:

00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,7

Baby?

49
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,3
Come on, this isn't funny!

50
00:02:26,056 --> 00:02:29,6

00:02:29,085 --> 00:02:30,9

00:02:41,091 --> 00:02:42,7
No.

55
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:44,6
Not a scratch.

56
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,8
Right, well, that
rules out iron.

57
00:02:46,008 --> 00:02:47,8
Try the copper.

58
00:02:50,017 --> 00:02:51,5
Oops.

59
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:54,6
You know exactly what's
causing your vulnerability.

60
00:02:54,084 --> 00:02:56,7
Chloe Decker is the one
I should be throwing knives at.

61
00:02:56,097 --> 00:02:58,3
Who knows
what she's hiding.

62
00:02:58,055 --> 00:03:00,7
Yes, she seems to be
the one thing that can hurt me,

63
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:03,2
but there may be
other things as well.

64
00:03:03,043 --> 00:03:05,7
The detective may simply be
a cog in a bigger machine.

65
00:03:05,093 --> 00:03:06,9
This is called being thorough.

66
00:03:07,018 --> 00:03:08,0
More like denial.

67
00:03:08,023 --> 00:03:09,4
Because if you really thought

68
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:10,8
that I could hurt you
with these,

69
00:03:11,002 --> 00:03:12,2
you wouldn't let me

70
00:03:12,044 --> 00:03:13,5
throw them at you.

71
00:03:15,057 --> 00:03:17,3
Very funny.

72
00:03:17,053 --> 00:03:19,1
Demon daggers forged in Hell
don't count.

73
00:03:19,036 --> 00:03:22,0
We all know those prick.

74
00:03:23,016 --> 00:03:25,1
And speaking of,

75
00:03:25,033 --> 00:03:26,7
how's my brother?

76
00:03:28,029 --> 00:03:30,6
Three weeks
of a whole lot of this?

77
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:33,0
How do you think he's doing?

78
00:03:33,025 --> 00:03:34,3
You're not going
steady, Maze.

79
00:03:34,054 --> 00:03:36,0
You're getting close
to him for a reason.

80
00:03:36,021 --> 00:03:37,0
Don't forget it.

81
00:03:37,026 --> 00:03:38,2
I haven't.

82
00:03:38,046 --> 00:03:39,6
And I don't think Amenadiel

83
00:03:39,088 --> 00:03:41,1
is the one weaponizing Chloe.

84
00:03:41,038 --> 00:03:42,5
You don't think?

85
00:03:42,076 --> 00:03:44,5
Game's too dangerous
to be guessing.

86
00:03:44,072 --> 00:03:46,5
I think it's time to send

87
00:03:46,072 --> 00:03:48,7
my brother back to high Heaven.

88
00:03:50,035 --> 00:03:53,5
Forcibly, if necessary.

89
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:59,9
(shouts, grunting)

90
00:04:00,015 --> 00:04:01,0
(laughing)

91
00:04:01,024 --> 00:04:03,5
See, there is something else.

92
00:04:03,074 --> 00:04:06,0
(elevator bell dings)
It seems Italian marble
is also a threat, so...

93
00:04:06,024 --> 00:04:08,2
(doors opening)

94
00:04:08,045 --> 00:04:09,6
Oh.

95
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,8
Detective?

96
00:04:11,008 --> 00:04:12,2
What a surprise.

97
00:04:12,042 --> 00:04:13,7
Where have you been?

98
00:04:13,092 --> 00:04:15,0
Ah, you know me--
busy, busy.

99
00:04:15,025 --> 00:04:16,9
- No rest for the wicked.
- Right.

100
00:04:17,013 --> 00:04:19,8
'Cause deviant foreplay
is so time-consuming.

101
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,1
Want to watch?

102
00:04:21,034 --> 00:04:22,2
I've been calling you

103
00:04:22,043 --> 00:04:23,7
for three weeks.

104
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:25,6
Why are you avoiding me?

105
00:04:25,089 --> 00:04:27,2
Well, I do have a business
to run, Detective.

106
00:04:27,047 --> 00:04:29,2
I can't play
Good Cop/Handsome Devil Cop

107
00:04:29,043 --> 00:04:30,9
all the time.

108
00:04:31,018 --> 00:04:32,9
I've got a case
that I can't do without you.

109
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:35,6
Really?
(stammers)

110
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,6
What's so special about it?

111
00:04:39,007 --> 00:04:41,5
You just have
to see for yourself.

112
00:04:41,074 --> 00:04:43,8
Right.

but we found the
victim's purse

123
00:05:00,059 --> 00:05:01,6
in a Dumpster
behind the theater.

124
00:05:01,088 --> 00:05:03,4
Her name's Rose Davis.

125
00:05:03,068 --> 00:05:05,5
She's 19 and...

126
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,6
What are you
doing back there?

127
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,6
Just listening
to your boring facts.

128
00:05:09,081 --> 00:05:11,7
She's a freshman at Pasadena
City College, lives in Arca--

129
00:05:11,098 --> 00:05:13,1
Yeah, excuse me, Detective,
I'm not hearing

130
00:05:13,035 --> 00:05:15,3
any reasons to why
you need me on this case.

131
00:05:15,052 --> 00:05:16,7
I don't know
how you can hear anything--

132
00:05:16,098 --> 00:05:17,8
you're standing
five feet away from me.

133
00:05:18,006 --> 00:05:18,8
Get over here.

134
00:05:19,007 --> 00:05:19,8
You sound phlegmy.

135
00:05:20,007 --> 00:05:20,8
I don't want to get sick.

136
00:05:21,007 --> 00:05:22,5
Really? Let's go.

137
00:05:22,078 --> 00:05:24,7
PROTESTORS (chanting):
Satan is here, but God is near!

138
00:05:24,099 --> 00:05:26,8
Satan is here, but God is near!
Satan is here...

139
00:05:27,007 --> 00:05:29,0
You.

140
00:05:29,024 --> 00:05:30,7
Evil is here.

141
00:05:30,091 --> 00:05:32,9
Evil is here.

142
00:05:33,012 --> 00:05:35,0
PROTESTORS (chanting):
Satan is here, but God is near!

143
00:05:35,021 --> 00:05:36,6
Friend of yours?

144
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:38,7
- Satan is here, but God is near!
- I meet a lot of people.

145
00:05:38,096 --> 00:05:39,8
Satan is here, but God...

146
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:41,9
Take the sheet off.

148
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:50,8
Oh, well.

149
00:05:51,001 --> 00:05:52,7
That is unfortunate.

150
00:05:52,097 --> 00:05:56,3
But I still don't understand
why you need me on this case.

151
00:05:56,052 --> 00:05:58,0
Roll her over.

152
00:06:01,057 --> 00:06:03,1
That's why.

153
00:06:03,032 --> 00:06:04,9

156
00:06:20,029 --> 00:06:21,4
This is sickening.

157
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:22,7
I know.

158
00:06:22,092 --> 00:06:23,9
It's horrific.

159
00:06:24,013 --> 00:06:25,8
No, I mean, to
blame it on me.

160
00:06:26,005 --> 00:06:27,4
It's an atrocity.

161
00:06:27,063 --> 00:06:29,1
These Satanists.

162
00:06:29,034 --> 00:06:31,0
Misguided cult nobheads

163
00:06:31,026 --> 00:06:32,5
with Frisbees in
their earlobes.

164
00:06:32,076 --> 00:06:34,1
This poor girl's death

165
00:06:34,031 --> 00:06:35,7
has nothing to do
with me, Detective.

166
00:06:35,093 --> 00:06:37,3
MAN: This is your doing!
This is your fault!

167
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,7
You, what are you
doing in here?

168
00:06:38,094 --> 00:06:39,8
You're the Devil!

169
00:06:40,006 --> 00:06:41,6
You're the King of All Evil!

170
00:06:41,081 --> 00:06:43,7
You're the King
of All Lies!

171
00:06:43,094 --> 00:06:45,0
You must be destroyed!

172
00:06:45,023 --> 00:06:46,6
I'm gonna give you what for

173
00:06:46,086 --> 00:06:47,8
if you don't get out
of my crime scene, pal.

174
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:48,9
Who let this guy through?

175
00:06:49,016 --> 00:06:50,2
He's the Devil!

176
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,4
I'll rise again
against you!

177
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:54,6
No thanks necessary.

178
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:57,7
Just wanted to do my part
for the man of the hour.

179
00:06:58,004 --> 00:06:59,2
It's the wink
with the porn stache

180
00:06:59,046 --> 00:07:00,7
sending the wrong message,
I think.

181
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,0
(laughs)

182
00:07:02,025 --> 00:07:03,3
Do you two know
each other?

183
00:07:03,054 --> 00:07:05,0
Nope, just heard
a lot about this guy.

184
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,2
All bad, of course.

185
00:07:06,042 --> 00:07:08,4
Detective Malcolm Graham.

186
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,7
I wasn't gonna tell her
we're already buddies.

187
00:07:12,097 --> 00:07:15,0
You know,
me trying to kill you,

188
00:07:15,047 --> 00:07:16,9
the whole magic coin thing.

189
00:07:17,014 --> 00:07:18,3
TMI-- am I right?

190
00:07:18,056 --> 00:07:20,4
I'd like you to stop
touching me now.

191
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,9
(laughs)

192
00:07:22,015 --> 00:07:23,7
Ah, you're hilarious.

193
00:07:23,098 --> 00:07:25,7
We should get a drink sometime.

194
00:07:25,098 --> 00:07:27,8
Yeah, maybe play some pool, huh?

195
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,8
Hey, Chloe?

196
00:07:36,008 --> 00:07:38,1
If, uh, if we could talk soon,

197
00:07:38,033 --> 00:07:39,6
some stuff went down
with Malcolm.

198
00:07:39,087 --> 00:07:41,1
I mean, I know now's
a bad time...

199
00:07:41,037 --> 00:07:42,4
Yeah, it is.

200
00:07:44,009 --> 00:07:45,9
This bruising here
around the stab wounds.

201
00:07:46,017 --> 00:07:47,1
DAN:
Hilt marks maybe.

202
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:48,5
And these.

203
00:07:48,071 --> 00:07:50,3
There's subdermal implants.

204
00:07:50,055 --> 00:07:51,8
They don't look fresh.

205
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:53,1
I don't know what they are.

206
00:07:53,034 --> 00:07:54,8
Symbols?
Designs maybe?

207
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,2
Well, not a lot of places do
that kind of body modification.

208
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:59,8
Malcolm and I will try
to find who put them in.

209
00:08:00,002 --> 00:08:01,5
All right.

210
00:08:01,073 --> 00:08:03,6
He and I have to meet
Rose's father at her apartment.

211
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,3
Right, where
is that exactly?

212
00:08:05,057 --> 00:08:08,3
Uh, 1625 Lynrose.

213
00:08:08,057 --> 00:08:09,8
Right, I'll see you there.

214
00:08:10,007 --> 00:08:11,4
What? What-what
are you doing?

215
00:08:11,065 --> 00:08:12,7
I'm gonna take my own ride.

216
00:08:12,095 --> 00:08:14,1
You're a wretched driver.

217
00:08:14,032 --> 00:08:15,8
Since when?

218
00:08:16,003 --> 00:08:20,1
♪ It's colder now than it was ♪

219
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:22,8
♪ Yesterday ♪

220
00:08:23,004 --> 00:08:25,1
♪ Warm down south ♪

221
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:26,4
♪ So I'm on my way... ♪

222
00:08:26,067 --> 00:08:28,0
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

223
00:08:28,017 --> 00:08:30,0
- Were you close
with your daughter?
- Yes.

224
00:08:30,021 --> 00:08:32,8
Well, we were
when she was little, but

225
00:08:33,005 --> 00:08:35,0
you know, single father
with a teenage daughter...

226
00:08:35,022 --> 00:08:37,9
Yes, I'm quite familiar
with the absentee father

227
00:08:38,014 --> 00:08:39,3
excuses.

228
00:08:39,056 --> 00:08:41,3
Can you tell us why Rose
marred herself recently

229
00:08:41,052 --> 00:08:43,3
- with subdermal implants?
- What?

230
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:45,2
That doesn't sound like Rosie.

231
00:08:45,044 --> 00:08:48,5
This bookshelf's
been moved a lot.

232
00:08:54,007 --> 00:08:55,9
(hinges creaking)

233
00:08:58,091 --> 00:09:00,9
Oh, lovely.

234
00:09:01,016 --> 00:09:04,0
Very mid-century rapist.

235
00:09:05,058 --> 00:09:07,4
Hello, bad guys?

236
00:09:22,023 --> 00:09:24,1
What is this place?

237
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:28,2
It's a creepy,
secret evil room.

238
00:09:28,044 --> 00:09:29,6
You didn't know about this?

239
00:09:29,082 --> 00:09:31,6
No.

240
00:09:36,024 --> 00:09:37,6
What's this?

241
00:09:37,082 --> 00:09:39,8
It's a chicken.

242
00:09:40,003 --> 00:09:41,4
Or what's left of it.

243
00:09:41,058 --> 00:09:43,3
If that's supposed to be
an offering for me,

244
00:09:43,054 --> 00:09:45,9
then I decline on grounds
of salmonella.

245
00:09:48,075 --> 00:09:50,0
This picture, th--

246
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:52,3
this isn't Rose.

247
00:09:54,042 --> 00:09:56,0
Mr. Davis, I'm so sorry.

248
00:09:56,026 --> 00:09:58,3
But maybe this wasn't
a random attack.

249
00:09:58,051 --> 00:10:00,6
Maybe your daughter was involved
with whoever killed her.

250
00:10:00,085 --> 00:10:02,4
It's a large man
by the looks of it,

251
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:06,1
who's, uh,
not a fan of bathing.

252
00:10:06,031 --> 00:10:07,8
MR. DAVIS:
This is crazy.

253
00:10:08,006 --> 00:10:10,2
I mean, even if she was
into this stupid Devil thing,

254
00:10:10,048 --> 00:10:12,3
she wouldn't have
sacrificed herself.

255
00:10:12,053 --> 00:10:14,6
Yes, but sometimes the people
closest to you can turn on you.

256
00:10:14,082 --> 00:10:16,4
Wouldn't you agree, Detective?

257
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,9
Maybe.

258
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:23,3
"For my Corazon.

259
00:10:23,054 --> 00:10:24,3
Love, Rose."

260
00:10:24,054 --> 00:10:25,4
"Corazon" is Spanish for heart.

261
00:10:25,062 --> 00:10:27,9
Could be a term of endearment.

262
00:10:28,012 --> 00:10:29,9
Could be a name.

263
00:10:30,017 --> 00:10:33,6
MR. DAVIS: I should've
reached out.

264
00:10:33,088 --> 00:10:36,1
Called more.

265
00:10:36,034 --> 00:10:38,3
I thought I knew her.

266
00:10:38,051 --> 00:10:42,2
Oh, yes, I know
exactly how you feel.

267
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,3
(phone rings)

268
00:10:46,098 --> 00:10:48,6
Decker.

269
00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:51,4
We called around, found the girl
that gave Rose her subdermals.

270
00:10:51,065 --> 00:10:54,2
Said she, uh, came in a
couple weeks ago with a guy.

271
00:10:54,044 --> 00:10:56,2
Weird guy, apparently,
with a weird name, too,

272
00:10:56,044 --> 00:10:57,7
but she can't remember it.

273
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,4
Ask if the name's Corazon.

274
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:02,6
Hey.
Was the guy's name Corazon?

275
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,1
Yeah, that's it.

276
00:11:04,037 --> 00:11:06,2
Uh, jet black hair,
lots of piercings and tattoos.

277
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,3
Did you hear that?

278
00:11:09,054 --> 00:11:11,0
Yeah, generic Satanist.

279
00:11:11,025 --> 00:11:13,0
What about the, uh, subdermals--
she know what they mean?

280
00:11:13,021 --> 00:11:14,3
No.

281
00:11:14,059 --> 00:11:15,8
Says Rose brought them
in herself.

282
00:11:16,001 --> 00:11:17,8
She was super secretive
about 'em.

283
00:11:18,005 --> 00:11:19,0
Uh-huh.

284
00:11:19,022 --> 00:11:20,8
We'll talk soon.

285
00:11:21,009 --> 00:11:22,8
Ah, look at you two.
(sighs)

286
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,3
Marriage falling apart,

287
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:25,6
trying to work together...

288
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:27,3
So cute.

289
00:11:27,056 --> 00:11:28,9
Yeah, well, maybe if you hadn't
sent her a break-up text

290
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:30,8
- while I was unconscious...
- Oh.

291
00:11:31,006 --> 00:11:32,6
Hey, speaking of

292
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:35,1
kicking your ass, I'm proud
of you for bouncing back.

293
00:11:35,032 --> 00:11:36,8
Friends fight, right?

294
00:11:37,003 --> 00:11:38,1
Yeah.

295
00:11:38,036 --> 00:11:40,2
Dick.

296
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,2
(distant siren wailing)

297
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,2
(alarm chirps)

298
00:11:48,087 --> 00:11:50,0
(growling)

299
00:11:50,021 --> 00:11:51,2
(grunts)

300
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:54,5
Why is Lucifer still alive?

301
00:11:54,075 --> 00:11:55,5
Oh, it's you.

302
00:11:55,075 --> 00:11:57,0
You scared me, dude.

303
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,4
Have you forgotten
what will happen to you

304
00:11:58,067 --> 00:11:59,6
if you don't comply
with our deal?

305
00:11:59,084 --> 00:12:02,5
No, but I forgot to tell you!

306
00:12:02,076 --> 00:12:04,5
Lucifer spilled the beans.

307
00:12:08,022 --> 00:12:09,1
What are you talking about?

308
00:12:09,035 --> 00:12:10,5
All that jazz about

309
00:12:10,077 --> 00:12:12,2
condemning me
to eternal damnation?

310
00:12:12,048 --> 00:12:13,8
Poppycock, apparently.

311
00:12:14,006 --> 00:12:15,8
You're an angel

312
00:12:16,007 --> 00:12:18,2
and Lucifer said that
you're not allowed to kill me.

313
00:12:18,048 --> 00:12:20,4
Plus...

314
00:12:20,061 --> 00:12:22,2
I got this beauty right here.

315
00:12:22,045 --> 00:12:24,6
It's my
get-out-of-Hell-free card.

316
00:12:24,082 --> 00:12:26,6
(growls)

317
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,7
(sighs)

318
00:12:30,091 --> 00:12:32,4
So...

319
00:12:32,062 --> 00:12:35,6
unless you got
a better offer...

320
00:12:35,084 --> 00:12:39,5
#TeamLucifer.

321
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,9
It's not half bad, this.

322
00:12:42,017 --> 00:12:43,7
I mean, the writing's atrocious,

323
00:12:43,093 --> 00:12:45,4
but it's not complete drivel.

324
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:46,8
Listen to this:

325
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:49,2
"Satan represents
a beacon of honesty

326
00:12:49,047 --> 00:12:52,6
in a sea of mass
self-deceit."

327
00:12:52,081 --> 00:12:53,6
Mmm.

328
00:12:53,081 --> 00:12:54,7
And... oh. Hello.

329
00:12:54,098 --> 00:12:56,0
There's a whole chapter on sex.

330
00:12:56,023 --> 00:12:57,1
I like this book.

331
00:12:58,044 --> 00:13:00,8
Rose's subdermal implants--

332
00:13:01,003 --> 00:13:03,1
I'm pretty sure they're letters.

333
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,9
But I've arranged them
100 different ways

334
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,4
and I can't come up
with anything significant.

335
00:13:08,066 --> 00:13:12,0
"Chili furis"?

336
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:15,8
"I hurl ficis"?

337
00:13:17,075 --> 00:13:19,5
No.

338
00:13:19,075 --> 00:13:22,0
But could... could you
come over here, please?

339
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:32,0
Oh, bloody hell.

340
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:36,1
Filii hircus.
It's Latin.

341
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,6
Means "children of the goat."

342
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:39,2
Why do they always
associate me with goats?

343
00:13:39,044 --> 00:13:40,7
I mean, I don't even
like their cheese.

344
00:13:42,011 --> 00:13:43,3
Here we go.

345
00:13:43,049 --> 00:13:44,7
"Church of the Dark Prince."

346
00:13:48,049 --> 00:13:49,7
Location is secret.

347
00:13:49,099 --> 00:13:52,1
Looks like you have
to be a member.

348
00:13:52,037 --> 00:13:55,5
Geez, look at
this questionnaire.

349
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,2
Oh, and of course,

350
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,6
there's a fee.

351
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:00,3
$200? Sinful.

352
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:01,8
There's got to be a faster way.

353
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,1
LUCIFER:
"What is your gift
to the Devil?"

354
00:14:06,068 --> 00:14:09,1
CHLOE:
How about... filii hircus?

355
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:10,8
Yes!

356
00:14:11,001 --> 00:14:11,8
(mumbling to self)

357
00:14:13,081 --> 00:14:15,5
All right.
Okay... what...

358
00:14:15,073 --> 00:14:17,5
Yeah, I'll see you there!

359
00:14:19,052 --> 00:14:20,5
What...?

360
00:14:20,073 --> 00:14:23,0
♪♪

361
00:14:33,004 --> 00:14:33,9
(clears throat)

362
00:14:36,091 --> 00:14:38,0
Okay.

363
00:14:38,021 --> 00:14:40,0
That's it.

364
00:14:40,021 --> 00:14:41,4
You're being a freak.

365
00:14:41,067 --> 00:14:43,5
You've been avoiding
me for weeks,

366
00:14:43,075 --> 00:14:44,8
you won't get
in my car.

367
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,1
What's your problem?

368
00:14:46,038 --> 00:14:47,5
There's no problem.

369
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,6
Just maybe
you're not as charming

370
00:14:48,084 --> 00:14:51,5
as you think you are.

371
00:14:51,076 --> 00:14:54,3
Wait, is this about
that vulnerability thing?

372
00:14:54,056 --> 00:14:56,2
Actually, yes.

373
00:14:58,044 --> 00:15:00,5
I mean... I get the teensiest
bit touchy-feely with you

374
00:15:00,073 --> 00:15:02,1
and you freak out.

375
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,7
Ugh. All I meant
that night

376
00:15:03,098 --> 00:15:05,4
is that I can trust you.

377
00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:07,9
That's all.

378
00:15:08,015 --> 00:15:08,9
Okay?

379
00:15:09,015 --> 00:15:09,9
Okay.

380
00:15:10,011 --> 00:15:11,2
Okay.

381
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:11,9
Okay.

382
00:15:20,025 --> 00:15:21,8
(clears throat)

383
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,2
(whispering):
Filii hircus.

384
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:27,4
(sighs)

385
00:15:27,063 --> 00:15:28,7
Habeas corpus?

386
00:15:28,092 --> 00:15:30,0
Bababooey?

387
00:15:30,026 --> 00:15:32,2
You had it right the first time.

388
00:15:32,047 --> 00:15:34,4
But today is private.

389
00:15:35,093 --> 00:15:39,0
Too private
for Lucifer himself?

390
00:15:39,027 --> 00:15:40,3
You're supposed to be blond.

391
00:15:40,052 --> 00:15:43,0
Yes, I get that a lot.

392
00:15:43,027 --> 00:15:45,2
- You have ID?
- Absolutely.

393
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:46,8
Let me just, uh...

394
00:15:47,003 --> 00:15:48,1
Oh. Dearie me.

395
00:15:48,036 --> 00:15:49,8
I seem to have
left it in the car.

396
00:15:50,003 --> 00:15:51,3
Detective, would you mind
going to fetch it, please?

397
00:15:51,053 --> 00:15:52,6
What am I, your dog?

398
00:15:58,045 --> 00:15:59,2
(screams)

399
00:16:00,016 --> 00:16:01,7
Detective...

400
00:16:01,096 --> 00:16:03,8
After you.

401
00:16:11,076 --> 00:16:13,6
It's very Eyes Wide Shut.

402
00:16:13,084 --> 00:16:15,9
Too bad I forgot
my sexy mask.

403
00:16:16,014 --> 00:16:18,1
Does anything scare you?

404
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:19,8
Should it?

405
00:16:20,002 --> 00:16:22,3
MAN:
Rose is gone.

406
00:16:22,052 --> 00:16:23,8
But it is not her death
that was important,

407
00:16:24,006 --> 00:16:25,2
it was her life.

408
00:16:25,044 --> 00:16:27,2
The imprint she left behind.

409
00:16:27,048 --> 00:16:29,9
See, Rose will be remembered.

410
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:32,1
She will live on forever.

411
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,4
This isn't a sacrifice.

412
00:16:34,066 --> 00:16:35,6
It's a memorial.

413
00:16:35,082 --> 00:16:37,2
Quite civilized,
actually.

414
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:40,5
- Yeah, they don't
seem like killers.
- Mmm.

415
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,9
ONYX:
And so now

416
00:16:42,012 --> 00:16:44,6
it is time to invoke

417
00:16:44,088 --> 00:16:46,7
the Four Crowned Princes
of Hell.

418
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,4
Oh. Scratch that.

419
00:16:48,063 --> 00:16:50,6
Visualize the blue light

420
00:16:50,084 --> 00:16:52,6
filling your entire being.

421
00:16:52,084 --> 00:16:55,1
Satan to the east.

422
00:16:55,034 --> 00:16:57,0
Beelzebub to the north...

423
00:16:57,022 --> 00:16:58,4
This is preposterous.

424
00:16:58,068 --> 00:17:00,6
I thought
you'd love this.

425
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:02,5
First of all,
there's only one me.

426
00:17:02,073 --> 00:17:04,4
And secondly, the whole worship
thing is more my father's bag.

427
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,7
And now...

428
00:17:06,098 --> 00:17:09,6
Lucifer will speak!

429
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:10,7
What?

430
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:15,3
(thump)
Ooh.

431
00:17:15,057 --> 00:17:17,4
Oh. No. No, no,
no, no, no.

432
00:17:17,066 --> 00:17:19,3
- This is where
I draw the line.
- Ow.

433
00:17:19,054 --> 00:17:21,7
- Ow.
- Excuse me, excuse me! Sorry.

434
00:17:21,091 --> 00:17:22,9
Sorry.

435
00:17:23,012 --> 00:17:24,0
MAN:
Hey, man.

436
00:17:24,021 --> 00:17:25,5
If you would just butt out.

437
00:17:25,071 --> 00:17:26,5
Right!

438
00:17:26,071 --> 00:17:28,1
I'm the real Lucifer

439
00:17:28,038 --> 00:17:31,5
and I insist that you stop
this nonsense immediately.

440
00:17:31,071 --> 00:17:33,5
I mean, have you
heard yourselves?
It's embarrassing.

441
00:17:33,072 --> 00:17:35,3
Blue light coming out your ass

442
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:37,0
or whatever it was.

443
00:17:37,026 --> 00:17:38,5
I mean, you preach rebellion,

444
00:17:38,072 --> 00:17:39,9
but you're-you're
misguided sheep.

445
00:17:40,014 --> 00:17:41,6
And goat.

446
00:17:41,085 --> 00:17:43,2
Where's the real defiance?

447
00:17:43,043 --> 00:17:44,7
The free will?
SATANIST:
Yeah!

448
00:17:44,094 --> 00:17:45,7
Free will!

449
00:17:45,094 --> 00:17:46,9
Free will rules!

450
00:17:47,006 --> 00:17:48,2
(applause)

451
00:17:48,048 --> 00:17:50,3
No, no!
You're doing it again.

452
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:51,6
Don't applaud.

453
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:53,1
This whole thing's a sham!

454
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,1
(woman whoops)

455
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,5
Anarchy!

456
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,5
(cheering, whooping)

457
00:17:56,074 --> 00:17:57,8
I mean, just-just look at this.

458
00:17:58,003 --> 00:17:59,4
What is this
supposed to be?

459
00:18:01,045 --> 00:18:02,7
Alien fetus?

460
00:18:02,091 --> 00:18:04,5
Pickled demon?

461
00:18:04,071 --> 00:18:06,5
He's the best Lucifer
we've had in years.

462
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:09,7
(chanting):
Lucifer! Lucifer!

463
00:18:09,092 --> 00:18:11,5
Lucifer...
Stop!

464
00:18:13,021 --> 00:18:15,0
Someone killed this girl!

465
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,5
She didn't deserve that.

466
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,9
This is not
what I stand for.

467
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:21,7
Is that what
you all wanted? Eh?

468
00:18:26,002 --> 00:18:28,6
Should be ashamed of yourselves.

469
00:18:33,036 --> 00:18:34,2
LAPD.

470
00:18:34,044 --> 00:18:35,9
Put the knife down.

471
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:41,5
Why were
you running?

472
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,9
I wasn't.

473
00:18:44,012 --> 00:18:44,9
I was upset.

474
00:18:45,012 --> 00:18:46,3
Feeling guilty, are you?

475
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:47,9
Tell me... why?

476
00:18:48,017 --> 00:18:50,2
What, our new Devil's
a cop, now, is he?

477
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,7
LUCIFER:
Oh, worse than that,
I'm afraid.

478
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:52,9
So come on.

479
00:18:53,017 --> 00:18:54,6
Tell me, what nasty little urge

480
00:18:54,088 --> 00:18:56,9
are you hiding
in your hoodie, hmm?

481
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:00,6
I want to kill...

482
00:19:00,084 --> 00:19:02,1
Yeah?

483
00:19:02,035 --> 00:19:05,1
I want to kill the sick bastard
who killed Rose.

484
00:19:05,035 --> 00:19:06,4
And then, after that,

485
00:19:06,064 --> 00:19:09,7
I want the hell
out of this racket.

486
00:19:09,098 --> 00:19:12,0
Oh.

487
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:13,8
What's your name?

488
00:19:14,007 --> 00:19:14,9
Onyx.

489
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:16,0
Hmm?

490
00:19:16,028 --> 00:19:17,5
(sighs)

491
00:19:17,078 --> 00:19:19,6
Mitch Watson.

492
00:19:19,082 --> 00:19:21,5
Yeah, I changed it
when I joined the church.

493
00:19:21,074 --> 00:19:24,9
12 years later,
I'm the frickin' high priest.

494
00:19:25,012 --> 00:19:26,2
I'd love to bail.

495
00:19:26,045 --> 00:19:28,0
Kind of late for
a career change, though.

496
00:19:28,021 --> 00:19:30,6
I mean,
the whole thing's a joke.

497
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,2
So, hold on...

498
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:34,4
Are you saying
you don't believe in Lucifer?

499
00:19:34,063 --> 00:19:36,9
Look, mate, the Devil ain't
gonna buy me an Aston Martin.

500
00:19:37,017 --> 00:19:38,4
Well, not with that attitude,
he won't.

501
00:19:38,067 --> 00:19:40,5
I mean,
I like the philosophy.

502
00:19:40,072 --> 00:19:42,1
But it attracts
a lot of weirdoes

503
00:19:42,034 --> 00:19:43,8
who take it way too seriously.

504
00:19:44,005 --> 00:19:45,1
And, of course,

505
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,2
now Rosie's dead.

506
00:19:47,047 --> 00:19:49,8
Yeah, and I see you
have the same subdermal
implants as she did.

507
00:19:50,002 --> 00:19:50,9
All the hard core members...

508
00:19:51,019 --> 00:19:52,1
they all get this.

509
00:19:52,035 --> 00:19:53,3
I was trying to tell Rosie

510
00:19:53,052 --> 00:19:54,8
that she would
regret it later,

511
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,2
but she became obsessed.

512
00:19:57,044 --> 00:19:59,1
She was an impressionable girl.

513
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:01,1
Well, her father was absentee.

514
00:20:01,032 --> 00:20:03,2
I suppose that's why she got
involved in all this nonsense,

515
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:04,7
to piss her dad off.

516
00:20:04,091 --> 00:20:06,6
Actually, it was, uh...
it was her boyfriend,

517
00:20:06,087 --> 00:20:08,4
Corazon, he's the one
who brought her in.

518
00:20:08,066 --> 00:20:10,6
Man, the guy's a creeper.

519
00:20:10,087 --> 00:20:13,2
He kept talking about doing
real sacrifices on animals.

520
00:20:14,084 --> 00:20:16,5
Did Corazon have
access to this knife?

521
00:20:16,071 --> 00:20:18,6
Yeah, probably.

522
00:20:19,088 --> 00:20:22,1
This here is just for show.

523
00:20:22,038 --> 00:20:25,1
The blade springs
inside the handle.

524
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,9
Hmm. Strange.

525
00:20:27,014 --> 00:20:29,0
'Cause if it was real...
it could definitely match

526
00:20:29,022 --> 00:20:30,3
the marks found
on Rose's body.

527
00:20:30,056 --> 00:20:32,0
We do have an actual version.

528
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:33,0
Hold on.

529
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:38,8
Knife's gone.

530
00:20:39,007 --> 00:20:40,1
Okay, we need
to find Corazon now.

531
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,3
- Yeah.
- Do you have, um,

532
00:20:41,057 --> 00:20:42,7
his real name,

533
00:20:42,091 --> 00:20:44,3
uh, where he lives,
his address?

534
00:20:44,057 --> 00:20:45,6
Give me a sec.

535
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,6
Ugh.

536
00:20:53,075 --> 00:20:55,0
Looks just like you.

537
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:56,5
I manscape.

538
00:20:58,038 --> 00:21:01,3
I'm starting to understand
why you chose this persona.

539
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:03,3
All-powerful...

540
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:04,5
Invincible...

541
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,8
Not exactly.

542
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:11,4
Ah. Or it's because you think
that everybody's out to get you.

543
00:21:11,064 --> 00:21:12,8
That's because they are.

544
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,4
But trust me,
I didn't choose it.

545
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:16,5
Why would anyone
choose to be vilified?

546
00:21:16,077 --> 00:21:18,5
Thought the Devil
was supposed to be immortal.

547
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:20,6
Well, one angel
can hurt another, so...

548
00:21:26,087 --> 00:21:28,3
Oh, what...?

549
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:31,2
What are you doing?

550
00:21:31,045 --> 00:21:33,0
(door opens)

551
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,4
No address, no last name,

552
00:21:35,062 --> 00:21:37,2
nothing.

553
00:21:37,042 --> 00:21:38,5
Hmm.

554
00:21:38,071 --> 00:21:40,6
He used PayPal to pay
for the fee.

555
00:21:40,084 --> 00:21:42,8
All right,
I'll call in a warrant.

556
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:51,3
Well, if you can't bring
Muhammad to the dim sum...

557
00:21:58,061 --> 00:22:00,4
Hey.

558
00:22:00,065 --> 00:22:02,1
Why'd you stand me up?

559
00:22:02,032 --> 00:22:04,4
I had one task...

560
00:22:04,065 --> 00:22:07,1
one...

561
00:22:07,032 --> 00:22:09,3
to get my brother
back to Hell.

562
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,2
I've not only failed,

563
00:22:16,046 --> 00:22:19,0
but I've actually
made things worse.

564
00:22:19,025 --> 00:22:21,4
I'm even sleeping with a demon.

565
00:22:24,072 --> 00:22:26,8
Yeah, you lucky
son of a bitch.

566
00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:30,9
Come on, you can't say

567
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:35,3
that this isn't the best
sex you've ever had.

568
00:22:35,052 --> 00:22:37,6
Well, it is the only sex
you've ever had, but still.

569
00:22:37,085 --> 00:22:39,6
(chuckles)

570
00:22:39,086 --> 00:22:43,4
Look, I've had
a lot of sex,

571
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:46,7
with men and women.

572
00:22:46,095 --> 00:22:48,3
- I mean a lot.
- Okay.

573
00:22:48,053 --> 00:22:49,9
Point made.

574
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:53,4
But this, with you,

575
00:22:53,062 --> 00:22:55,0
I don't know, it's...

576
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,4
it's different.

577
00:23:07,013 --> 00:23:09,9
But if you're
not happy here,

578
00:23:10,018 --> 00:23:11,9
then you should go home.

579
00:23:12,018 --> 00:23:15,3
I can't.

580
00:23:15,056 --> 00:23:19,5
I can't face my father
as a failure.

581
00:23:19,073 --> 00:23:21,5
Look, I have a job to do.

582
00:23:21,073 --> 00:23:23,8
There's no choice.

583
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:26,7
I understand.

584
00:23:36,004 --> 00:23:37,5
CHLOE:
Okay. Great.

585
00:23:37,075 --> 00:23:38,8
Yeah, I'll be here.

586
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,2
All right.

587
00:23:40,042 --> 00:23:42,2
So we got a real
name for Corazon--

588
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:44,3
Mike Carey-- but it could
take us a while to find him,

589
00:23:44,054 --> 00:23:46,5
- so you should
probably head home.
- Oh, no, no, no.

590
00:23:46,076 --> 00:23:48,4
Not till this human stain's
brought to justice.

591
00:23:48,067 --> 00:23:50,8
(scoffs)
I can't get near you,

592
00:23:51,009 --> 00:23:52,5
now I can't get rid of you.

593
00:23:52,076 --> 00:23:53,7
Whatever.

594
00:23:53,093 --> 00:23:54,9
I'm gonna go up and shower.

595
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:56,5
Stay put. Do not wake up Trixie.

596
00:24:00,069 --> 00:24:02,1
♪♪

597
00:24:06,057 --> 00:24:08,4
(sighs)

598
00:24:16,091 --> 00:24:19,5
Did you just throw a toy at me?

599
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:21,0
Oh, you're awake.

600
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:22,7
But since you're up,
I have some questions for you.

601
00:24:22,096 --> 00:24:24,2
Right.

602
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:26,5
Are you adopted?

603
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,5
In other words, are you sure
the detective is your mother?

604
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,3
Could she be
from somewhere else?

605
00:24:31,059 --> 00:24:33,2
Does she have
any special powers?

606
00:24:33,047 --> 00:24:35,7
- Uh-uh.
- What about any markings?

607
00:24:35,093 --> 00:24:37,7
Scars, on her back perhaps?

608
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,8
There's some chocolate cake
in it for you.

609
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:42,6
I want cash.

610
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:44,2
Oh.

611
00:24:44,048 --> 00:24:47,2
(chuckles)
I like your style.

612
00:24:47,048 --> 00:24:49,1
All right.

613
00:24:49,036 --> 00:24:51,1
Mommy does have a scar.

614
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:53,1
- Oh?
- On her butt.

615
00:24:53,032 --> 00:24:54,7
From when she got bit.

616
00:24:54,095 --> 00:24:56,0
By the Kraken.

617
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:57,4
Right.

618
00:24:58,074 --> 00:25:00,2
Not the direction
I was going for,

619
00:25:00,045 --> 00:25:02,0
but what's this Kraken
that you talk of?

620
00:25:02,029 --> 00:25:04,7
CHLOE:
My mom's evil Chihuahua.

621
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,3
Why aren't you
showering?

622
00:25:06,054 --> 00:25:07,4
'Cause I left
my phone down here.

623
00:25:07,067 --> 00:25:08,8
Why is Trixie awake?

624
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,4
(snaps)
Get back in bed, young lady.

625
00:25:11,063 --> 00:25:12,4
Night, Lucifer.

626
00:25:12,067 --> 00:25:15,4
All right, seriously.

627
00:25:15,064 --> 00:25:17,7
No more freaky behavior.

628
00:25:17,093 --> 00:25:19,7
If this is about the other
night, I'm sorry, okay?

629
00:25:19,093 --> 00:25:21,9
What do you want me to do,
take it all back?

630
00:25:22,018 --> 00:25:23,2
No, can you take
your shirt off, please?

631
00:25:23,048 --> 00:25:24,2
What?

632
00:25:25,044 --> 00:25:26,7
Are you serious?

633
00:25:26,098 --> 00:25:27,9
I need to see your back.

634
00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:29,9
Why?

635
00:25:30,011 --> 00:25:32,9
Because I want to know if you're
an angel sent to destroy me.

636
00:25:38,049 --> 00:25:39,7
(sighs)

637
00:25:42,075 --> 00:25:44,9
Nothing.

638
00:25:45,012 --> 00:25:47,0
Yeah.

639
00:25:47,021 --> 00:25:49,0
Is this about the scars
on your back?

640
00:25:49,021 --> 00:25:53,4
Look, I have no idea
what happened to you

641
00:25:53,063 --> 00:25:54,8
or what's going on with you now,

642
00:25:55,005 --> 00:25:57,8
but... not everyone's
out to get you.

643
00:25:59,051 --> 00:26:01,3
(phone buzzing)

644
00:26:01,056 --> 00:26:04,0
They found him-- Corazon.

645
00:26:14,053 --> 00:26:16,0
WOMAN:
We found his car like this.

646
00:26:16,024 --> 00:26:18,0
It's registered
to Mike Carey.

647
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:24,8
(clattering)
(gasps)

648
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,3
(Malcolm chuckles)

649
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:31,3
Just like old times, huh?

650
00:26:31,055 --> 00:26:32,5
Don't shoot me though.

651
00:26:32,075 --> 00:26:33,5
Funny.

652
00:26:33,076 --> 00:26:34,9
Come on,
I'm just joking.

653
00:26:35,017 --> 00:26:36,3
(clattering)

654
00:26:39,018 --> 00:26:42,3
Ah, Detective Douche,
Detective Stache.

655
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,3
What a pleasant surprise.

656
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,5
Did you find anything?

657
00:26:44,077 --> 00:26:46,4
Place seems empty.

658
00:26:56,003 --> 00:26:58,8
CHLOE (whispering):
My God.

659
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:14,6
It's definitely Mike Carey.

660
00:27:14,088 --> 00:27:17,6
Detectives,
can I show you something?

661
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:22,3
(siren wailing)

662
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,7
So what do you really
make of all this, huh?

663
00:27:24,093 --> 00:27:26,9
The "Hail, Lucifer,"
the pentagram?

664
00:27:27,014 --> 00:27:31,4
I think it's a long time since
I encountered genuine evil.

665
00:27:31,061 --> 00:27:32,8
Wow.

666
00:27:36,078 --> 00:27:38,2
(sniffing)

667
00:27:38,045 --> 00:27:39,9
It's not blood;
it's paint.

668
00:27:42,057 --> 00:27:44,8
So the killer
strapped Mike up

669
00:27:45,004 --> 00:27:47,5
then decided to go
all Jackson Pollock?

670
00:27:47,066 --> 00:27:49,8
I guess.

671
00:27:50,004 --> 00:27:53,5
Yeah, looks like an "A."

672
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:54,8
That can't be random.

673
00:27:55,005 --> 00:27:56,5
I think it's a word.

674
00:28:06,014 --> 00:28:09,6
(gasps)
Giant anamorphic print.

675
00:28:09,085 --> 00:28:11,6
"Morningstar."

676
00:28:11,085 --> 00:28:14,1
DAN:
Whoa.

677
00:28:14,031 --> 00:28:15,9
Another Satanic message.

678
00:28:16,015 --> 00:28:17,7
Or a fan letter.

679
00:28:17,094 --> 00:28:19,9
Morningstar is not exactly the
most common name for the Devil.

680
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,4
You think someone did
this for our Lucifer?

681
00:28:22,061 --> 00:28:24,3
That's kind of
a leap, Dan.

682
00:28:24,053 --> 00:28:26,7
Yeah, but if I'm right, it's
also a conflict of interest.

683
00:28:26,095 --> 00:28:28,9
Somebody could be doing
this on his behalf,

684
00:28:29,012 --> 00:28:30,5
or maybe he's involved
in a different way.

685
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:32,3
What does that mean?
LUCIFER: Yes.

686
00:28:32,054 --> 00:28:34,9
What are you insinuating?

687
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:36,3
That some psycho might
be killing people

688
00:28:36,054 --> 00:28:38,0
because of your whole
Devil shtick.

689
00:28:38,021 --> 00:28:39,9
You're blaming
this nonsense on me?

690
00:28:40,017 --> 00:28:41,7
You do take the whole Satan
thing pretty seriously.

691
00:28:41,097 --> 00:28:43,8
You really think
I'd do these vile things?

692
00:28:44,001 --> 00:28:46,4
These kids were
pretending to be bad,

693
00:28:46,064 --> 00:28:48,1
but they weren't,
they were innocent,

694
00:28:48,031 --> 00:28:49,7
so I would never hurt them,
I'm not a monster.

695
00:28:49,097 --> 00:28:50,8
CHLOE:
Okay, guys.

696
00:28:51,002 --> 00:28:52,3
That's enough.

697
00:28:54,077 --> 00:28:57,1
Lucifer, maybe you
should go home.

698
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,5
Oh, no, allow me to stay in this
rusty tin can a little longer.

699
00:29:00,074 --> 00:29:03,2
You came to me,
you insisted I work this case.

700
00:29:03,045 --> 00:29:05,5
Okay, this sounds crazy,

701
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:07,5
but this case
might involve you.

702
00:29:07,074 --> 00:29:08,7
What do you mean, involve me?

703
00:29:08,091 --> 00:29:10,2
You know what I mean.

704
00:29:10,045 --> 00:29:11,9
(sighs)
I'm trying to
protect you.

705
00:29:12,012 --> 00:29:16,3
Oh, protect me from the evil
or the world from evil me?

706
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:25,5
Can you believe
Detective von Douche

707
00:29:25,072 --> 00:29:27,2
boots me off the case?

708
00:29:27,043 --> 00:29:28,8
And Chloe agreed to this?

709
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,3
(sighs)
She didn't disagree.

710
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,9
(chuckles incredulously)

711
00:29:32,014 --> 00:29:33,2
How could she even
think I'm capable?

712
00:29:33,044 --> 00:29:34,3
Here?

713
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,6
That's why I left.

714
00:29:36,086 --> 00:29:37,9
I thought she knew me.

715
00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:39,5
I thought I knew her.

716
00:29:39,073 --> 00:29:41,1
And now you don't
trust her anymore?

717
00:29:41,036 --> 00:29:44,4
Oh, it's just this whole
immortality thing.

718
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:46,7
Uh, for some reason,

719
00:29:46,091 --> 00:29:49,2
Detective Decker
makes me vulnerable.

720
00:29:49,045 --> 00:29:52,2
Also known as "intimacy."

721
00:29:52,045 --> 00:29:55,5
No. No, she literally
makes me exsanguinate.

722
00:29:55,075 --> 00:29:58,5
Being vulnerable can be scary.

723
00:29:58,075 --> 00:30:01,9
But there are benefits when you
open yourself up to someone.

724
00:30:02,013 --> 00:30:03,4
I just wish I knew
who was behind this.

725
00:30:03,063 --> 00:30:04,5
My dad?

726
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,5
My brother?

727
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,2
Someone else?

728
00:30:07,047 --> 00:30:09,1
I mean, the detective
doesn't seem to know,

729
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,5
but she could
be lying.

730
00:30:10,072 --> 00:30:11,9
Is she part of the plan
to kill me,

731
00:30:12,014 --> 00:30:13,8
or is she just a-a pawn?

732
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:15,8
Maybe we should explore
the possibility

733
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:19,0
that being vulnerable
can be a good thing.

734
00:30:19,027 --> 00:30:21,4
No, it can't.

735
00:30:21,061 --> 00:30:23,6
It means you're at
someone else's mercy.

736
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:26,3
Then maybe you should just
stay away from everybody.

737
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:28,0
Stay away from Chloe.

738
00:30:28,028 --> 00:30:31,0
But...

739
00:30:31,028 --> 00:30:33,2
I don't want to.

740
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:35,6

- Satan is here, but God is near!
- You!

762
00:31:27,072 --> 00:31:29,1
I know you're behind this.

763
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:31,2
Because I have seen you.

764
00:31:31,047 --> 00:31:32,2
I know what you
really are.

765
00:31:32,047 --> 00:31:33,6
What I am is annoyed.

766
00:31:33,089 --> 00:31:35,3
Just let me go
to my club

767
00:31:35,056 --> 00:31:36,6
and move along, please.

768
00:31:36,081 --> 00:31:39,2
I know these murders
are your doing!

769
00:31:39,048 --> 00:31:41,1
I have no skeletons
in my closet,

770
00:31:41,035 --> 00:31:43,4
which is more than can be said
for you nasty little humans.

771
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:46,5
So come on, preacher man,
enough about me,

772
00:31:46,073 --> 00:31:48,8
let's talk about your dark
and nasties, shall we?

773
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:52,1
I must throw you into a
lake of sulfur and fire.

774
00:31:52,037 --> 00:31:54,1
Oh, so you want to destroy me.

775
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,0
Well, get in line.

776
00:31:56,024 --> 00:31:58,3
Yes, I wish...

777
00:31:58,058 --> 00:31:59,2
Yes.

778
00:31:59,041 --> 00:32:01,2
...I never met you.

779
00:32:01,042 --> 00:32:03,0
It's like some kind
of collective amnesia.

780
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:04,5
I mean, I walk around
this city of yours,

781
00:32:04,075 --> 00:32:06,5
solving its filthy
little crimes,

782
00:32:06,075 --> 00:32:07,9
and this is the thanks I get?

783
00:32:08,017 --> 00:32:08,8
You're a murderer.

784
00:32:09,005 --> 00:32:09,8
A murderer!

785
00:32:10,072 --> 00:32:13,6
Stop blaming me!

786
00:32:15,056 --> 00:32:18,0
I should destroy you.

787
00:32:18,027 --> 00:32:19,8
MAN: Hey, put him down!
MALCOLM: Whoa, whoa, whoa!

788
00:32:20,002 --> 00:32:21,4
Easy, easy.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

789
00:32:21,069 --> 00:32:23,6
This scumbag isn't
worth it, all right?

790
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:24,9
This isn't over.

791
00:32:26,094 --> 00:32:28,1
(chuckles)

792
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,9
You come to have a
go at me as well?

793
00:32:30,019 --> 00:32:31,3
Nah.

794
00:32:31,053 --> 00:32:32,3
Chloe thought you might
need protection

795
00:32:32,053 --> 00:32:33,7
from freaks like that.

796
00:32:33,091 --> 00:32:35,7
What I want is a drink.

797
00:32:39,095 --> 00:32:41,6
Hey, I'm sorry
about earlier.

798
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:43,2
Earlier today,
or three weeks ago,

799
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:45,2
when you broke up
with me in a text?

800
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:47,4
Chloe, I know.

801
00:32:47,063 --> 00:32:49,3
I've been looking for
a way to explain things,

802
00:32:49,055 --> 00:32:50,5
but nothing makes sense.

803
00:32:51,097 --> 00:32:53,5
I will fix this,
though, I promise.

804
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,7
No more promises.
I just want to do our jobs.

805
00:32:57,014 --> 00:32:58,3
What's that?

806
00:32:58,051 --> 00:33:00,3
(siren wailing)

807
00:33:05,027 --> 00:33:07,1
(indistinct radio transmission)

808
00:33:13,078 --> 00:33:15,6
This definitely
doesn't belong here.

809
00:33:15,087 --> 00:33:17,8
A monogrammed "M."

810
00:33:19,024 --> 00:33:20,4
Doesn't Lucifer
wear cuff links?

811
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:35,6
CHLOE:
Really? No prints,
no skin cells?

812
00:33:35,093 --> 00:33:37,4
Nope. Dead end.

813
00:33:37,068 --> 00:33:38,9
Unless you want to check
Lucifer's closet for the match.

814
00:33:39,018 --> 00:33:40,4
Very funny.

815
00:33:40,064 --> 00:33:42,1
Yo, Decker,
your partner's on TV.

816
00:33:42,031 --> 00:33:44,0
NEWSCASTER:
A video went viral today

817
00:33:44,023 --> 00:33:46,4
after a fight erupted
on Hollywood Boulevard.

818
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:48,9
Local club owner
Lucifer Morningstar

819
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:52,8
attacked Reverend Jacob Williams
when Williams claimed

820
00:33:53,003 --> 00:33:54,8
the businessman
with the devilish name

821
00:33:55,003 --> 00:33:56,4
was actually involved

822
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:59,4
in the Satanic murders
making recent headlines.

823
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,9
Apparently,
I'm not the only one.

824
00:34:01,016 --> 00:34:02,0
This is ridiculous.

825
00:34:02,029 --> 00:34:03,2
He didn't attack the guy.

826
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:05,2
He was defending himself.

827
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:08,2
Still hot.

828
00:34:09,071 --> 00:34:11,5
Sorry.

829
00:34:17,089 --> 00:34:19,1
The preacher.

830
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,3
Preacher's wearing
a cuff link.

831
00:34:20,051 --> 00:34:21,5
So what?

832
00:34:21,072 --> 00:34:22,6
A lot of guys do.

833
00:34:22,089 --> 00:34:23,6
One?

834
00:34:23,089 --> 00:34:25,1
With an "M"?

835
00:34:25,035 --> 00:34:26,3
DAN:
No way.

836
00:34:26,056 --> 00:34:27,8
Oh...

837
00:34:28,006 --> 00:34:29,0
It's not an "M."

838
00:34:29,023 --> 00:34:31,5
It's a "W," for Williams.

839
00:34:31,073 --> 00:34:33,0
Come on, Dan,
it makes sense.

840
00:34:33,023 --> 00:34:34,3
Who's gonna want
to kill Satanists

841
00:34:34,053 --> 00:34:35,7
more than a religious zealot?

842
00:34:37,078 --> 00:34:38,8
We gotta find him.

843
00:34:39,007 --> 00:34:40,8
MALCOLM:
Freakin' street preacher

844
00:34:41,003 --> 00:34:42,4
and his little minions, man.

845
00:34:42,062 --> 00:34:44,5
Who do they think they are?

846
00:34:44,075 --> 00:34:47,5
Bunch of posers.
(chuckles)

847
00:34:47,075 --> 00:34:48,5
Ah...

848
00:34:48,075 --> 00:34:50,1
Don't even sweat it, huh?

849
00:34:50,033 --> 00:34:51,9
What do you say we get
some ladies up in here, huh?

850
00:34:52,013 --> 00:34:54,3
Blow off some steam!

851
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:56,0
Emphasis on the "blow," huh?

852
00:34:56,026 --> 00:34:58,0
(chuckling)

853
00:35:01,072 --> 00:35:03,2
Why are you in my house?

854
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:06,4
Because I got your back, man.

855
00:35:06,064 --> 00:35:09,7
I saw the way they treated
you at the crime scene.

856
00:35:09,094 --> 00:35:12,2
Anyways, I know you didn't
kill those people.

857
00:35:12,044 --> 00:35:13,6
Did you?

858
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,7
(laughing):
I'm just joking! God...

859
00:35:19,091 --> 00:35:22,2
You need to relax,
get yourself a little shiatsu.

860
00:35:22,045 --> 00:35:23,4
Mmm.

861
00:35:23,062 --> 00:35:25,2
Ah...

862
00:35:25,045 --> 00:35:26,7
This feels good.

863
00:35:26,091 --> 00:35:28,9
Feels good,
hanging out here with you.

864
00:35:29,017 --> 00:35:32,0
I mean, ever since I, you know,
went to Hell, it's just...

865
00:35:32,025 --> 00:35:34,6
there's been things in my head

866
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:37,1
that no one would understand.

867
00:35:38,097 --> 00:35:39,9
Except you, of course.

868
00:35:40,018 --> 00:35:42,2
You know?

869
00:35:42,047 --> 00:35:43,9
I just want
you to know...

870
00:35:44,014 --> 00:35:46,7
I respect the hell out of you.

871
00:35:46,093 --> 00:35:48,0
(giggles)

872
00:35:48,023 --> 00:35:49,0
Get it?

873
00:35:49,023 --> 00:35:50,7
Hell? (laughs)

874
00:35:50,098 --> 00:35:52,1
Up top.

875
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:58,4
What, you just gonna
leave me hanging?

876
00:35:58,069 --> 00:36:00,8
You've got red paint
on your hand.

877
00:36:01,003 --> 00:36:02,4
Huh?

878
00:36:02,066 --> 00:36:04,1
Just like the paint
we found at the warehouse.

879
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:05,5
I must've gotten it on me
at the scene.

880
00:36:05,074 --> 00:36:06,7
Oh, I doubt that.

881
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:08,9
Everyone was wearing gloves.

882
00:36:16,017 --> 00:36:17,6
Aw, man!

883
00:36:17,084 --> 00:36:19,0
You caught me!

884
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:20,8
Literally red-handed.
(laughs)

885
00:36:21,005 --> 00:36:22,8
Oh, I was,
I was wondering

886
00:36:23,005 --> 00:36:24,6
when you'd figure it out.

887
00:36:24,085 --> 00:36:27,6
You know, when I asked
if you did it?

888
00:36:27,089 --> 00:36:29,9
Totally thought
you were gonna ask me.

889
00:36:30,018 --> 00:36:31,9
Been dying all day to tell you.

890
00:36:32,019 --> 00:36:34,1
You?

891
00:36:34,036 --> 00:36:35,3
Uh-huh.

892
00:36:35,052 --> 00:36:36,2
You did this?

893
00:36:36,044 --> 00:36:37,8
You killed those people?

894
00:36:38,007 --> 00:36:38,8
Oh, you mean
those frauds?

895
00:36:39,007 --> 00:36:40,4
Duh!

896
00:36:40,061 --> 00:36:41,7
So, what do you...
what do you think?

897
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:43,3
Impressed? Hmm?

898
00:36:43,057 --> 00:36:44,5
You're insane.

899
00:36:44,074 --> 00:36:45,9
I know! It's...

900
00:36:46,016 --> 00:36:47,1
Don't you love it?

901
00:36:47,037 --> 00:36:48,3
I mean, of course you do.

902
00:36:48,054 --> 00:36:49,5
I mean, we're the same.

903
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:52,1
Oh, we are not the same.

904
00:36:52,037 --> 00:36:53,6
Wait, wait, wait.

905
00:36:53,088 --> 00:36:56,2
I-If you're worried,

906
00:36:56,042 --> 00:37:00,1
I've got the perfect person
to pin it on:

907
00:37:00,034 --> 00:37:01,5
that street preacher.

908
00:37:01,076 --> 00:37:02,8
Genius, right?

909
00:37:03,009 --> 00:37:04,6
Guy's crazy. Yeah.

910
00:37:04,084 --> 00:37:06,0
And I already dropped
some evidence, so it's...

911
00:37:06,026 --> 00:37:08,1
Whoa!

912
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:10,1
But I did this for you.

913
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:11,1
Aren't you happy?

914
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:13,2
Why would I be happy?

915
00:37:13,048 --> 00:37:15,4
I'm not evil.
I punish evil.

916
00:37:15,069 --> 00:37:17,1
- Yeah, but, but you're,
you know...
- The Devil, yes.

917
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,4
And you think you know
who that is, don't you?

918
00:37:18,065 --> 00:37:19,8
The whole world does.

919
00:37:20,007 --> 00:37:22,3
A torturer, maybe.

920
00:37:22,057 --> 00:37:25,0
An inflictor of
just desserts, sure.

921
00:37:25,024 --> 00:37:27,7
But a senseless murderer
I am not.

922
00:37:27,091 --> 00:37:30,3
Perhaps I need to clarify
my position.

923
00:37:30,058 --> 00:37:31,6
Hey, hold on, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

924
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:33,2
I've got this, remember?

925
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:34,3
(laughs)

926
00:37:34,058 --> 00:37:35,6
Don't worry, Malcolm.

927
00:37:35,088 --> 00:37:37,5
I'm not gonna send you to Hell.

928
00:37:37,071 --> 00:37:40,0
I'm going to bring it
right to you.

929
00:37:42,022 --> 00:37:43,6
And after I'm finished with you,

930
00:37:43,088 --> 00:37:45,2
Detective Decker
can put you

931
00:37:45,043 --> 00:37:47,0
in a cold, dark room

932
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,3
so you can think about
what you've done, young man.

933
00:37:49,043 --> 00:37:51,1
Oh...

934
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:52,2
(both laughing)

935
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:56,2
(whimpering)

936
00:37:56,044 --> 00:37:57,2
Ah!

937
00:37:57,044 --> 00:37:59,8
AMENADIEL:
Why don't you pick on
someone your own size?

938
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:14,7
After the monumentally
dreadful day I've had,

939
00:38:14,096 --> 00:38:16,4
you decide to drop in now?

940
00:38:16,062 --> 00:38:17,5
I'm clearing up your mess,
by the way,

941
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:18,7
so if you don't mind.

942
00:38:18,096 --> 00:38:20,7
You sent your demon to seduce me

943
00:38:20,096 --> 00:38:22,2
and then kill me.

944
00:38:22,046 --> 00:38:24,2
(Lucifer chuckles)
AMENADIEL:
Yeah.

945
00:38:24,047 --> 00:38:26,3
I definitely mind.

946
00:38:28,059 --> 00:38:29,4
Right.

947
00:38:29,064 --> 00:38:30,5
Wonderful.

948
00:38:30,072 --> 00:38:31,7
Now look what you've done.

949
00:38:31,093 --> 00:38:33,6
The man you just freed--

950
00:38:33,081 --> 00:38:34,9
you know, the one
you raised from the dead--

951
00:38:35,014 --> 00:38:36,6
he's murdering humans.

952
00:38:36,081 --> 00:38:39,8
And that... that is on
your hands, brother.

953
00:38:39,098 --> 00:38:41,2
You're wrong.

954
00:38:41,048 --> 00:38:42,5
It's your fault.

955
00:38:42,078 --> 00:38:43,8
Oh...

956
00:38:44,003 --> 00:38:45,6
It always has been.

957
00:38:47,078 --> 00:38:48,9
Hate to break it to you, bro...

958
00:38:50,012 --> 00:38:51,3
(grunts)

959
00:38:51,058 --> 00:38:52,4
...but this time,
I'm fighting back.

960
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:54,0
(grunting)

961
00:38:54,025 --> 00:38:56,0
If only you'd done
what was asked of you,

962
00:38:56,021 --> 00:38:57,2
none of this
would've happened,

963
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:58,9
and I'd still be home...

964
00:38:59,017 --> 00:39:00,2
(grunts)

965
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:01,4
...where I belong!

966
00:39:01,067 --> 00:39:04,4
Heaven? Really?

967
00:39:04,067 --> 00:39:05,9
You're sure that's
still home, eh?

968
00:39:06,017 --> 00:39:07,7
After everything you've done?

969
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,6
Sleeping with
a demon.

970
00:39:11,085 --> 00:39:15,0
Think Dad might have
another assignment for you.

971
00:39:15,022 --> 00:39:17,4
Somewhere, I don't know,
slightly warmer.

972
00:39:18,052 --> 00:39:19,7
(yells)

973
00:39:25,078 --> 00:39:27,1
Why?

974
00:39:27,036 --> 00:39:29,0
Why did you have to use her?

975
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:31,6
(laughs)

976
00:39:31,082 --> 00:39:34,4
Now I get what this little
tantrum's really about.

977
00:39:34,066 --> 00:39:36,4
It's about Maze.

978
00:39:36,066 --> 00:39:38,1
You like her.

979
00:39:38,037 --> 00:39:40,4
Well, I mean,
I don't blame you, brother.

980
00:39:40,062 --> 00:39:42,8
She is a wild woman in the sack.

981
00:39:48,067 --> 00:39:50,2
Listen, if you
wanted me dead,

982
00:39:50,043 --> 00:39:52,0
you should've had the balls
to do it yourself!

983
00:39:54,018 --> 00:39:56,0
Oh, please.

984
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:58,4
You're the one who's been
using pawns from the start.

985
00:39:58,064 --> 00:39:59,8
Linda, Malcolm, huh?

986
00:40:00,006 --> 00:40:01,8
Now the detective.

987
00:40:03,056 --> 00:40:05,4
- You're a coward!
- Chloe?

988
00:40:05,061 --> 00:40:08,0
I don't even know what
you're talking about!

989
00:40:08,024 --> 00:40:09,9
You always were
a lousy liar.

990
00:40:15,053 --> 00:40:17,2
You justify it all,
don't you?

991
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:18,5
Claim it's all done

992
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:20,6
in the name of our father,

993
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:22,7
but...

994
00:40:22,092 --> 00:40:25,1
it's for your sake, brother.

995
00:40:25,038 --> 00:40:26,7
And they call me
the prideful one.

996
00:40:26,096 --> 00:40:29,3
Enough!

997
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:31,5
I'm the pawn.

998
00:40:31,076 --> 00:40:34,2
You both used me.

999
00:40:35,093 --> 00:40:37,7
You know what?

1000
00:40:37,097 --> 00:40:38,8
Here.

1001
00:40:40,094 --> 00:40:42,8
Kill each other.

1002
00:40:57,012 --> 00:40:58,7
(sighs)

1003
00:41:00,004 --> 00:41:02,7
Now where do I get a drink?

1004
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,2
The last place the preacher
was seen was near LUX.

1005
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:08,2
Remember, he's to be considered
armed and dangerous.

1006
00:41:08,042 --> 00:41:09,8
Malcolm took Lucifer
into the club.

1007
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,3
You guys see anything,
you get on the radio.

1008
00:41:11,059 --> 00:41:12,4
All right, I'll check the club.

1009
00:41:12,063 --> 00:41:13,5
You guys search the area.

Everyone's doing it.

Yeah, your scuffle
with the preacher

1017
00:41:36,032 --> 00:41:37,5
made the local news.

1018
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:38,5
(laughs)

1019
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:40,0
Oh, that.

00:41:40,029 --> 00:41:42,2

five disasters ago.

Yeah, well, what can I say?

1023
00:41:46,008 --> 00:41:47,2
You should've seen
the other chap.

1024
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:48,5
Thought I did.

1025
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:49,7

(scoffs)
Well...

1027
00:41:52,034 --> 00:41:53,9
where do I begin?

1028
00:41:54,013 --> 00:41:57,7
With the grandest fall
in the history of time?

1029
00:41:57,093 --> 00:41:59,7
Or perhaps
the far more agonizing

1030
00:41:59,093 --> 00:42:01,4
punishment that followed?

1031
00:42:03,006 --> 00:42:04,3
To be blamed for every

All I ever wanted

1037
00:42:19,066 --> 00:42:21,9
was to be my own man here.

1038
00:42:22,016 --> 00:42:24,6
To be judged for my own doing.

1039
00:42:24,087 --> 00:42:26,0
And for that?

1040
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:29,4
I've been shown
how truly powerless I am.

1041
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,5
That even the people I trusted--

Yes?

1047
00:42:50,056 --> 00:42:52,5
(laughing):
What?

1048
00:42:52,073 --> 00:42:54,2
Put your hands up
and move away from the bar.

1049
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:02,0
Detective,
there's an explanation...

1050
00:43:02,024 --> 00:43:03,0
Stop!

1051
00:43:03,024 --> 00:43:04,1
Don't say another word.

1052
00:43:04,033 --> 00:43:05,1
Put your hands up.

1053
00:43:08,004 --> 00:43:09,3
Or you'll leave
us no choice.

1054
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:13,9
Lucifer Morningstar,
you're under arrest.
