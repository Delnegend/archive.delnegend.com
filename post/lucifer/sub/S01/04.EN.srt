1
00:00:01,008 --> 00:00:05,1
- Previously on Lucifer...
- You're the Lord of Hell,
for crying out loud.

2
00:00:05,034 --> 00:00:07,5
I'm retired, Maze.
I've got nothing but time.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,6
How could you possibly help me?

4
00:00:08,084 --> 00:00:10,1
I have the ability

5
00:00:10,034 --> 00:00:11,9
to draw out
people's forbidden desires.

6
00:00:12,018 --> 00:00:14,3
I got it. The name,
the whole Lucifer thing,

7
00:00:14,051 --> 00:00:15,8
and desire's like
your superpower.

8
00:00:16,001 --> 00:00:17,5
It's more like a gift
from God, really.

9
00:00:17,068 --> 00:00:19,3
I saw Lucifer do some things
that I can't explain.

10
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,2
Is Lucifer a magician?

11
00:00:21,043 --> 00:00:23,3
That's sort of
what I'm trying to figure out.

12
00:00:23,052 --> 00:00:26,8
You were once the brightest
of all of God's angels.

13
00:00:27,007 --> 00:00:27,8
And now,

14
00:00:28,007 --> 00:00:29,8
your time here on Earth

15
00:00:30,003 --> 00:00:31,3
is affecting you, dear brother.

16
00:00:31,053 --> 00:00:32,3
You're changing.

17
00:00:32,053 --> 00:00:33,9
My life is change.

18
00:00:34,016 --> 00:00:35,2
What are you doing here?

Ooh, how's your ex?
Detective Douche?

20
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,0
You like working with
the detective, don't you?

21
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,7
I told you,
I'm good at punishing people.

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,3
Nay, I'm the best
at punishing bad people.

23
00:00:44,058 --> 00:00:46,3
Yeah, well, I think
you don't just enjoy

24
00:00:46,058 --> 00:00:48,1
punishing the bad guys.

25
00:00:48,038 --> 00:00:49,5

Well,

47
00:02:30,052 --> 00:02:32,6
good morning, Detective.

00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:36,8
What the hell
are you doing here?

00:02:37,007 --> 00:02:39,8
- Setting the table.
- You broke into my house?

Yes, well,
I hope you don't mind,

Lucifer,
get out of my house now.

- We haven't eaten yet.
- Out.

Well, don't we need to discuss

- Out.

00:03:08,002 --> 00:03:09,9
We're already late, so let's go.

are you doing here?

71
00:03:14,052 --> 00:03:15,8
Nothing in his name.

73
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:17,8

What are you guys
doing here anyway?

77
00:03:22,087 --> 00:03:25,1
She left her bird report here.

79
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,0
Um, not really.
Here, have a snack, child.

80
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,8
Are you sleeping
with this idiot?

81
00:03:33,008 --> 00:03:35,5
She hasn't had the pleasure,
unfortunately, no.

82
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:39,2
Okay, everybody out.
Trixie has to get to school.

Come on, out, please.

No, no, no, no, no,

Yes, shocking, isn't it?

- No.
- Never been thrown out

Lucifer, we don't
have an appointment.

103
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,2
Something very disturbing's
just happened.

104
00:04:26,047 --> 00:04:27,7
It's horrific, really.

105
00:04:27,093 --> 00:04:29,3
Uh, for the second time,

00:04:29,052 --> 00:04:30,8

Okay, sorry, uh, Lu...

108
00:04:32,014 --> 00:04:33,6
I mean,
I'm starting to wonder

109
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,6
if the detective has some sort
of biological dysfunction.

110
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:37,2
- Lucifer.
- 'Cause, I mean, I appeal

111
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:38,9
to the virile urge in all women.

112
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:40,6
Certainly, well, certainly you
can attest to that, can't you?

113
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:42,7
Uh, Lucifer, stop.

114
00:04:42,095 --> 00:04:44,3
Yes, of course, sorry.
Payment first.

115
00:04:44,053 --> 00:04:46,9
Uh, no. No, no, no,
no, no, no. No! No!

116
00:04:47,016 --> 00:04:48,3
Hmm?

117
00:04:48,053 --> 00:04:51,6
Lucifer, this
is George.

118
00:04:53,025 --> 00:04:54,4

121
00:04:59,034 --> 00:05:00,7
Oops.

122
00:05:10,006 --> 00:05:12,1
- Dan, if you're here
to scold me...
- No.

123
00:05:12,035 --> 00:05:14,9
I just got off the phone
with the lieutenant.

124
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:16,4
There's a case.

125
00:05:18,031 --> 00:05:19,9
Day four.

126
00:05:20,011 --> 00:05:22,4
Down to three meat sticks,
a half a bottle of water,

127
00:05:22,069 --> 00:05:25,2
217 miles to L.A.

128
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,0
I'm not sure
we're gonna make it,

129
00:05:27,028 --> 00:05:30,3
'cause my brother drives
like a narcoleptic old lady.

130
00:05:30,054 --> 00:05:32,5

00:05:32,075 --> 00:05:33,9

132
00:05:34,016 --> 00:05:36,2
No, that's our
only nourishment!

133
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,0
DAN:
Her name's Lindsay Jolson.

134
00:05:38,021 --> 00:05:39,9
Just turned 22.

135
00:05:40,013 --> 00:05:42,3
She went missing
catering a Players' Club event.

136
00:05:42,059 --> 00:05:44,0
Players' Club?

137
00:05:44,022 --> 00:05:45,5
It's one of those skeezy
pickup artist groups.

138
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,5
You know, that teach geeks
how to be sex gods.

139
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,3
Got it.

140
00:05:49,051 --> 00:05:51,3
Lindsay was last seen
talking to the lead scumbag.

141
00:05:52,064 --> 00:05:55,4
The founder,
Carver Cruz.

142
00:05:55,069 --> 00:05:57,5
So he was interrogated?

143
00:05:57,077 --> 00:05:59,3
Yep, but his lawyer
did all the talking.

144
00:05:59,056 --> 00:06:01,3
And with no proof, we're stuck.

145
00:06:01,057 --> 00:06:03,6
But there's a Players' seminar
and after-party today.

146
00:06:03,086 --> 00:06:05,1
And you need to go undercover.

147
00:06:05,036 --> 00:06:07,0
Why me? I'm homicide.

148
00:06:07,028 --> 00:06:08,4
Because you're our best way in.

149
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:10,1
- I am?
- Apparently these events

150
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,9
are pretty exclusive,
and when I saw the guest list,

151
00:06:12,012 --> 00:06:13,3
I recognized one of the names.

152
00:06:13,058 --> 00:06:14,8
I guess a lot

153
00:06:15,004 --> 00:06:16,5
of high-end club owners
are invited.

154
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:18,3
Oh, come on.

155
00:06:18,058 --> 00:06:20,5
No. You're kidding.

156
00:06:20,071 --> 00:06:22,4
(chuckles) I wish I was.

157
00:06:22,063 --> 00:06:24,3
- Lucifer's on the list?
- Yeah.

158
00:06:24,055 --> 00:06:26,1
Yeah, of course he is.

159
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:28,0
(sighs)

160
00:06:28,022 --> 00:06:30,1
Look...

161
00:06:30,035 --> 00:06:33,3
the last thing I want
is the guy I found

162
00:06:33,056 --> 00:06:35,3
making my half-naked wife
breakfast this morning

163
00:06:35,052 --> 00:06:36,6
spending more time with her,

164
00:06:36,085 --> 00:06:38,3
separated or not.

165
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,7
But...

166
00:06:39,094 --> 00:06:41,6
This is the best option.

167
00:06:41,081 --> 00:06:44,2
I wouldn't ask,
but I just keep thinking,

168
00:06:44,044 --> 00:06:47,7
what if this was
our daughter?

169
00:06:50,078 --> 00:06:53,9
The detective seems like
a very lovely woman.

170
00:06:54,012 --> 00:06:56,1
Well, I suppose,
but still, she's human.

171
00:06:56,033 --> 00:06:58,2
Why is she able
to refuse my charms?

172
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,4
I mean, is this thing on?

173
00:07:00,063 --> 00:07:02,8
Yes, yes.

174
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:05,3
Definitely on.

175
00:07:06,071 --> 00:07:07,7
(sighs)

176
00:07:07,097 --> 00:07:09,2
It's not that you're afraid

177
00:07:09,047 --> 00:07:11,1
that you don't have power
over Chloe.

178
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,1
It's that you're afraid
that she has power over you,

179
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,0
but neither
one is true.

180
00:07:15,022 --> 00:07:16,7
- No?
- No.

181
00:07:16,093 --> 00:07:19,6
People don't have
power over us.

182
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:21,8
We give it to them.

183
00:07:22,006 --> 00:07:23,7
You have to take
your power back.

184
00:07:23,094 --> 00:07:25,7
Right, go on.

185
00:07:25,094 --> 00:07:28,6
You say she's nothing special,
but I think you've put her

186
00:07:28,086 --> 00:07:30,0
on a pedestal.

187
00:07:30,024 --> 00:07:33,0
You need to really
get to know her,

188
00:07:33,028 --> 00:07:34,6
warts and all.
(chuckles)

189
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:36,5
I'm sure she has some.

190
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:38,0
(chuckles)

191
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:41,5
So, (clears throat)
demystify her

192
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:44,5
by bringing her back
down to your own level.

193
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:49,4
You're right.

194
00:07:49,063 --> 00:07:51,1
It's not her, it's me.

195
00:07:51,034 --> 00:07:53,4
I need to take back control.

196
00:07:53,064 --> 00:07:55,1
I need to behave
like I always have.

197
00:07:55,035 --> 00:07:56,9
Good. So you understand.

198
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,1
Yes.

199
00:07:58,031 --> 00:07:59,6
Yes. (chuckles)

200
00:07:59,081 --> 00:08:01,6
I mean,
it seems obvious now, actually.

201
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:03,6
I need to have sex with her.

202
00:08:03,081 --> 00:08:07,1
Uh... no, uh, that's
not what I said.

203
00:08:07,032 --> 00:08:08,8
No, no, no, you're a genius.

204
00:08:09,003 --> 00:08:09,9
I mean, that's the best way
to lose interest, right?

205
00:08:10,015 --> 00:08:11,9
Right. Good-o.

206
00:08:12,016 --> 00:08:13,2
Hmm.

207
00:08:13,049 --> 00:08:14,6
Thanks, love.

208
00:08:14,082 --> 00:08:16,0
Oh, sure.

209
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:17,8
Payment next time, okay?
Uh...

210
00:08:19,045 --> 00:08:20,8
Um...

211
00:08:27,088 --> 00:08:29,9
CHLOE:
Her name's Lindsay Jolson.

212
00:08:30,017 --> 00:08:31,3
Mm-hmm.

213
00:08:31,051 --> 00:08:33,3
She's been missing
almost three full days.

214
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:35,3
Right, so just ask
me one more time.

215
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,2
Lucifer,
there's a girl missing.

216
00:08:37,047 --> 00:08:39,4
(chuckles) Yes, it's
just not every day

217
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:41,4
someone kicks you out of your
house, then three hours later

218
00:08:41,068 --> 00:08:43,1
asks you on a date.

219
00:08:43,035 --> 00:08:45,3
It's not a date.
It's a work thing.

220
00:08:45,052 --> 00:08:47,1
- Oh.
- And are you gonna
help me or not?

221
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,1
All right.

222
00:08:49,036 --> 00:08:51,3
But only 'cause
it coincides perfectly

223
00:08:51,053 --> 00:08:52,7
with my own plan.

224
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:54,5
And what plan is that?

225
00:08:54,074 --> 00:08:56,7
Well, to have sex with you,
of course.

226
00:08:56,095 --> 00:08:58,6
(laughs) Okay.

227
00:08:58,087 --> 00:09:01,2
Wait, you and I...
well, there is no you and I.

228
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,8
There's a professional
situation,

229
00:09:03,004 --> 00:09:05,0
- and I just need you...
- See, you need me.

230
00:09:05,021 --> 00:09:07,0
The department needs you,
because you're the one...

231
00:09:07,021 --> 00:09:08,3
I'm the one?

232
00:09:08,054 --> 00:09:11,9
On the list
for the Player thing.

233
00:09:12,013 --> 00:09:13,1
You're quite adorable
when you're flustered.

234
00:09:13,038 --> 00:09:15,4
I... I'm not flustered.

235
00:09:15,064 --> 00:09:17,3
I'm nauseous.

236
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,0
Now you're blushing;
I'd say I'm making headway.

237
00:09:19,022 --> 00:09:23,0
Okay, look, let me make myself
perfectly clear.

238
00:09:23,023 --> 00:09:25,6
I will never,

239
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:28,8
ever, ever sleep with you.

240
00:09:29,007 --> 00:09:30,2
Never.

241
00:09:30,048 --> 00:09:31,8
Okay? Got it?

242
00:09:32,007 --> 00:09:33,5
Playing hard to get,
I like it.

00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,7

377
00:14:49,047 --> 00:14:51,5
What if you have all
those manly whatnots

378
00:14:51,072 --> 00:14:53,8
and a woman still
doesn't respond?

379
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:56,5
You may think you have them,
but you don't.

380
00:14:56,077 --> 00:14:58,4
- Yeah.
- That's why
you're here, right?

381
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,4
So, gentlemen,
you follow these rules,

382
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:03,3
and you will bed any Betty
you desire, guaranteed.

383
00:15:03,052 --> 00:15:05,2
LUCIFER:
No. No.

384
00:15:05,044 --> 00:15:07,4
No, no, no. I'm certain I've got
everything on your little list,

385
00:15:07,061 --> 00:15:08,9
and more, actually,

386
00:15:09,011 --> 00:15:12,5
yet this woman here
won't have sex with me.

387
00:15:12,074 --> 00:15:15,3
(laughter)

388
00:15:15,058 --> 00:15:17,2
Just listen to the speech,
buddy.

389
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,5
The system works.

390
00:15:19,075 --> 00:15:21,1
No, but I doubt that.

391
00:15:21,033 --> 00:15:23,3
Because... because if
I can't "bed a Betty,"

392
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:25,1
then how do you
possibly expect

393
00:15:25,034 --> 00:15:27,4
any of these poor miscreants
to succeed?

394
00:15:27,067 --> 00:15:28,9
(crowd grumbles)

395
00:15:29,013 --> 00:15:30,4
Especially when
they're taking advice

396
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:32,4
from a-a wanker such as you?

397
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:33,7
All right, just sit down, man.

398
00:15:33,093 --> 00:15:35,6
Yeah, Lucifer, sit down.

399
00:15:35,081 --> 00:15:37,7
I-I just... could we get
the spotlight over here?

400
00:15:37,098 --> 00:15:38,9
(chuckles)
Do we have that?

401
00:15:39,018 --> 00:15:39,9
Yeah, yeah.

402
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:41,4
But on-on her.

403
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:44,2
Good. Right.
Now, you're the expert.

404
00:15:44,048 --> 00:15:46,5
You tell me
what's wrong with this picture.

405
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:47,9
I mean, I'm me.

406
00:15:48,015 --> 00:15:48,9
Right?

407
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:50,2
And she...

408
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,9
Well, she's a cop,
for starters.

409
00:15:52,011 --> 00:15:54,0
(crowd grumbles)
She's a cop?

410
00:15:54,028 --> 00:15:55,5
Yes. I mean, talk about

411
00:15:55,078 --> 00:15:57,1
the shallow end of
the dating pool.

412
00:15:57,037 --> 00:15:58,2
This is private property.

413
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,5
Unless you have a warrant,

414
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:01,0
you need to leave here
immediately.

415
00:16:01,021 --> 00:16:02,0
Security!

416
00:16:02,021 --> 00:16:03,7
Security, her, out.

417
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:05,1
Okay, we're gonna take
a ten-minute intermission.

418
00:16:05,038 --> 00:16:06,4
All right? Thank you.

419
00:16:06,067 --> 00:16:08,4
I haven't finished.

420
00:16:08,063 --> 00:16:09,3
All right.

421
00:16:09,055 --> 00:16:11,3
Oh, it's you again.

422
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:16,3
Have you two...?

423
00:16:18,014 --> 00:16:19,3
I know.

424
00:16:19,056 --> 00:16:20,9
I'm-I'm sorry,
Lieutenant.

425
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:22,6
I... No. No.

426
00:16:22,085 --> 00:16:24,2
I've got it
under control.

427
00:16:24,044 --> 00:16:25,5
And Mr. Morningstar,
too, yes.

428
00:16:25,077 --> 00:16:26,8
Let me talk to him.

429
00:16:26,098 --> 00:16:28,4
It's a her, and no.

430
00:16:28,061 --> 00:16:29,8
Really? Your boss is a she?

431
00:16:30,003 --> 00:16:31,4
Even better.
Give me the phone, I'll fix it.

432
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,6
No, you can't
fix this!

433
00:16:32,082 --> 00:16:33,9
You've already
said enough.

434
00:16:34,016 --> 00:16:34,9
Sorry!

435
00:16:35,016 --> 00:16:36,8
Not you.

436
00:16:36,099 --> 00:16:39,3
Yes, I-I'll figure out
a way into the party.

437
00:16:39,054 --> 00:16:40,5
It's not a problem.

438
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,7
And-and again,

439
00:16:41,091 --> 00:16:43,5
I...

440
00:16:43,067 --> 00:16:46,2
So we're going
to the Player after-party.

441
00:16:46,042 --> 00:16:47,6
Not you. I am.

442
00:16:47,088 --> 00:16:49,6
Well, I'm not sure
how that's possible,

443
00:16:49,088 --> 00:16:50,8
now that you've
blown your cover.

444
00:16:51,001 --> 00:16:52,6
Well, that was 100% your fault.

445
00:16:52,088 --> 00:16:55,0
I beg to differ.
None of that would have happened

446
00:16:55,022 --> 00:16:56,6
if you'd just complied
with my request.

447
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,0
Do you honestly think
you can just ask people

448
00:16:58,026 --> 00:16:59,6
to have sex with you
and they will?

449
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:01,0
Well, I usually don't
have to ask, actually.

450
00:17:01,023 --> 00:17:03,3
But trust me,
it'd be a win-win.

451
00:17:03,052 --> 00:17:04,4
And probably
another win after that.

452
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:05,8
I mean, I have
tremendous stamina.

453
00:17:06,006 --> 00:17:07,9
There's a girl missing, Lucifer.

454
00:17:08,019 --> 00:17:09,6
She's probably in some
hellhole somewhere,

455
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:12,2
scared out of her mind,
if she's even still alive.

456
00:17:12,044 --> 00:17:14,4
And I found out the party
is a cash-only event.

457
00:17:14,061 --> 00:17:15,5
That's a first for Carver.

458
00:17:15,074 --> 00:17:17,3
So our only suspect's

459
00:17:17,057 --> 00:17:19,4
probably about to run off
to Mexico,

460
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:21,6
and you're worried
about boning me?

461
00:17:21,087 --> 00:17:23,1
You're right. Sorry.

462
00:17:23,037 --> 00:17:24,5
- Let's find the girl. Okay?
- Yes.

463
00:17:24,071 --> 00:17:25,5
Sex later.

464
00:17:26,058 --> 00:17:27,5
Kidding.

465
00:17:27,075 --> 00:17:28,5
Sort of.

(sighs)

467
00:17:30,013 --> 00:17:30,8
So where's the party?

468
00:17:31,005 --> 00:17:33,0
- Cold Bar.
- Really?

469
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:35,6
Well, that place is notoriously
overpriced to rent.

470
00:17:35,084 --> 00:17:37,7
If Carver wants cash,
he shouldn't have it there.

471
00:17:39,089 --> 00:17:41,7
No, he shouldn't.

472
00:17:44,006 --> 00:17:46,3
I think I just figured out
how you can fix this.

473
00:17:46,056 --> 00:17:47,8
Oh?

474

00:22:37,031 --> 00:22:38,9
Turns out, the words "open bar"
are indeed effective.

567
00:22:39,015 --> 00:22:40,7
So good on you.

568
00:22:40,094 --> 00:22:42,8
- Okay.
- Can't go wearing

569
00:22:43,007 --> 00:22:44,3
that scruffy little getup.

570
00:22:44,053 --> 00:22:46,3
You'll stick out
like a sore cop.

571
00:22:48,007 --> 00:22:50,1
♪♪

572
00:22:55,016 --> 00:22:57,7
Where did you get
this dress anyhow?

573
00:22:57,096 --> 00:23:00,5
Oh, it was left behind by
one of my overnight guests.

574
00:23:00,071 --> 00:23:02,2
What was she wearing
when she left?

575
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:03,9
- A smile.
- Mm.

576
00:23:04,013 --> 00:23:06,9
If I get an STD from this thing,
I'm gonna kill you.

577
00:23:07,013 --> 00:23:08,9
Oh, there he is.

578
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:12,3
CHLOE: Oh, he doesn't
look suspicious at all.

579
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,2
Hmm, so what's the
plan, Detective?

580
00:23:14,043 --> 00:23:16,1
Avoid him for now.

581
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:18,8
Mingle, find people who were
at the party last week.

582
00:23:19,006 --> 00:23:20,9
See if anyone saw Carver
with our missing girl.

583
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:21,6
Hey.

584
00:23:21,081 --> 00:23:22,8
Hi.

585
00:23:23,007 --> 00:23:24,5
- Are you from Tennessee?
- No.

586
00:23:24,078 --> 00:23:25,6
Because you're

587
00:23:25,082 --> 00:23:26,7
the only ten I see.

588
00:23:26,094 --> 00:23:28,0
LUCIFER:
Oh, you poor soul.

589
00:23:28,024 --> 00:23:29,2
Does that actually work?

590
00:23:29,049 --> 00:23:31,2
- No.
- No, I didn't think so.

591
00:23:31,045 --> 00:23:32,7
(laughs) It's cute.

592
00:23:32,095 --> 00:23:33,7
It-it is?

593
00:23:33,095 --> 00:23:35,3
Yeah.

594
00:23:35,058 --> 00:23:38,2
Y-You're cute.
You're really cute.

595
00:23:38,046 --> 00:23:40,9
Hey, were you at that party
last week?

596
00:23:41,017 --> 00:23:42,7
Uh, no, actually,
this is my first.

597
00:23:42,096 --> 00:23:44,4
Okay.

598
00:23:44,063 --> 00:23:47,9
MAN: I love this song!
Okay.

599
00:23:48,013 --> 00:23:50,7
Hey, oh, were you
at the party last week?

600
00:23:50,093 --> 00:23:52,9
Uh, I think the dress may
have backfired, actually.

601
00:23:54,081 --> 00:23:56,4
I think we've
been spotted.

602
00:23:58,098 --> 00:24:00,1
Clearly a man with
nothing to hide.

603
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,2
Move!

604
00:24:03,044 --> 00:24:04,9
Get out of the way!
(people screaming)

605
00:24:05,015 --> 00:24:06,4
Just...

606
00:24:06,065 --> 00:24:07,5
get out.

607
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:09,0
Move!

608
00:24:09,028 --> 00:24:10,8
Just come...

609
00:24:12,045 --> 00:24:13,7
Give me the gun, Carver.

610
00:24:13,091 --> 00:24:15,6
Just-just let me go, okay?
I need to go!

611
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:17,1
I'm afraid that's
not possible,

612
00:24:17,033 --> 00:24:19,1
but I do have another
option for you.

613
00:24:19,037 --> 00:24:20,4
How about a broken back, hmm?

614
00:24:20,066 --> 00:24:21,8
(groans)

615
00:24:23,063 --> 00:24:25,4
You don't understand,
I have to go!

616
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:27,3
They're gonna
kill her now!

617
00:24:27,055 --> 00:24:28,6
You just killed Lindsay!

618
00:24:28,088 --> 00:24:30,0
They? They who?

619
00:24:31,055 --> 00:24:32,9
The people who took her.

620
00:24:39,047 --> 00:24:40,8
Where is Lindsay?

621
00:24:41,002 --> 00:24:42,4
I don't know, okay?

622
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:45,3
I swear to you,
somebody kidnapped her.

623
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:47,2
If that's the case, then why
wouldn't you go to the cops?

624
00:24:47,048 --> 00:24:49,2
Because they said
they'd kill her if I did.

625
00:24:49,044 --> 00:24:50,6
Maybe they already have.

626
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:52,0
Excuse me, dear,
I don't know why we bother

627
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:53,5
with all these pithy
little police questions.

628
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:55,4
Tell me...

629
00:24:57,003 --> 00:24:58,9
...what game's
the player playing, eh?

630
00:24:59,012 --> 00:25:00,0
What are you after?

631
00:25:02,096 --> 00:25:04,6
I just want Lindsay back.

632
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:05,7
I swear,

633
00:25:05,096 --> 00:25:07,4
I would never hurt her.

634
00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:10,9
I love her.

635
00:25:12,088 --> 00:25:14,0
But she's a fluffy bunny.

636
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:16,0
You're a wolf.

637
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,9
You-You've built an empire on
the objectification of women.

638
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:19,8
Yeah, I know.
I'm a complete hypocrite.

639
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:22,9
But I-I would give anything
to get her back.

640
00:25:23,014 --> 00:25:24,3
You humans.

641
00:25:24,052 --> 00:25:26,7
(chuckles):
You never cease to amaze.

642
00:25:26,098 --> 00:25:28,9
Okay, Carver,

643
00:25:29,015 --> 00:25:31,0
say what you're saying is true.

644
00:25:31,028 --> 00:25:32,7
How long have you and Lindsay
been together?

645
00:25:32,094 --> 00:25:34,1
Four months.

646
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,8
Next Tuesday.

647
00:25:36,003 --> 00:25:37,7
I tried to keep it quiet,

648
00:25:37,091 --> 00:25:40,9
'cause, you know,
I'm the man and everything.

649
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,3
I guess it got out.

650
00:25:42,054 --> 00:25:44,0
So you're saying
you slept

651
00:25:44,029 --> 00:25:45,5
with Lindsay on
multiple occasions,

652
00:25:45,075 --> 00:25:47,7
but you still want
to be with her?

653
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,4
Yes, and for the rest
of my life.

654
00:25:49,063 --> 00:25:51,3
Well, after
four months,

655
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:54,1
you haven't got her, you know,
out of your system? (chuckles)

656
00:25:54,034 --> 00:25:55,4
How's that possible?

657
00:25:55,068 --> 00:25:56,7
CHLOE:
Okay.

658
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:00,9
You have no idea
where they're holding Lindsay?

659
00:26:01,014 --> 00:26:04,2
No. But they did
send this to me...

660
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,0
...after the seminar.

661
00:26:08,081 --> 00:26:11,9
Said no more cops or she's dead.

662
00:26:12,019 --> 00:26:15,2
So the kidnappers were there
yesterday watching you.

663
00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:17,1
CARVER: I just hope
they weren't at the party.

664
00:26:17,036 --> 00:26:18,3
If they hurt her, I...

665
00:26:18,057 --> 00:26:19,4
CHLOE:
It's okay.

666
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,8
Is there anyone
you suspect

667
00:26:23,004 --> 00:26:24,0
that might do this to you?

668
00:26:24,025 --> 00:26:25,5
Enemies?

669
00:26:25,071 --> 00:26:27,6
Uh, I'm kind of
a polarizing guy.

670
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:29,5
Okay, the hater
list is long.

671
00:26:29,071 --> 00:26:31,8
Hello there,
this is Lucifer Morningstar.

672
00:26:34,088 --> 00:26:36,5
Who are you
talking to?

673
00:26:36,076 --> 00:26:38,1
- Shh.
- Do not shush me.

674
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:39,5
Who's on the phone?

675
00:26:39,072 --> 00:26:40,9
All one word, that's right.

676
00:26:41,014 --> 00:26:42,5
Yes, I'll be speaking
on Carver's behalf

677
00:26:42,072 --> 00:26:43,9
from now on.

678
00:26:44,018 --> 00:26:45,8
(chuckles)
No, I'm not a cop.

679
00:26:46,002 --> 00:26:47,2
I assure you.

680
00:26:47,048 --> 00:26:49,0
- Is that the...
- Yes, it's the kidnappers.

681
00:26:49,027 --> 00:26:50,4
What are you doing?

682
00:26:50,069 --> 00:26:52,0
Of course we have the money.

683
00:26:52,023 --> 00:26:53,9
Just give me a time
and location.

684
00:26:54,011 --> 00:26:54,8
(tutting)

685
00:26:55,003 --> 00:26:55,7
Give me the phone.

686
00:26:55,094 --> 00:26:57,1
No, I promise you, no police.

687
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,7
All right?
Okay, then.

688
00:26:59,095 --> 00:27:00,9
- See you shortly. Bye-bye.
- Wait, wait.

689
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,3
Wait, we need proof of life.

690
00:27:02,058 --> 00:27:03,9
Oh.

691
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,6
Um, just a minute.

692
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:07,4
How do we know
Lindsay's still alive?

693
00:27:07,062 --> 00:27:08,8
No, they've hung up.

694
00:27:10,038 --> 00:27:11,4
What are you doing?

695
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:13,1
Not to worry.
I've handled it.

696
00:27:13,034 --> 00:27:15,5
I'll be making an exchange
on your behalf this evening.

697
00:27:15,071 --> 00:27:17,5
Cash for your lady love,
all right?

698
00:27:17,076 --> 00:27:19,2
Really?

699
00:27:19,047 --> 00:27:22,2
Uh, but why would
you do that for me?

700
00:27:22,043 --> 00:27:24,6
Well, (chuckles)
isn't it obvious?

701
00:27:24,081 --> 00:27:26,6
Number two on your list:
be a protector.

702
00:27:26,089 --> 00:27:27,8
Is it working?

703
00:27:28,006 --> 00:27:29,5
You're not doing
this alone.

704
00:27:29,077 --> 00:27:32,0
Afraid so.
I promised, no police.

705
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:34,3
A deal's a deal, especially one
with the Devil. (chuckles)

706
00:27:34,057 --> 00:27:37,6
Besides, I'm the only one
not risking his life on this.

707
00:27:37,082 --> 00:27:39,8
Immortal, remember?

708
00:27:42,032 --> 00:27:44,4
(phone chimes)

709
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:46,4
LINDSAY (crying):
Carver,

710
00:27:46,066 --> 00:27:48,1
I'm all right.

711
00:27:49,025 --> 00:27:50,9
I'm a...

712
00:27:51,012 --> 00:27:52,5
I don't know where I am.

713
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:55,4
Please come get me.

714
00:27:55,063 --> 00:27:56,9
I love you.

715
00:27:57,017 --> 00:27:58,7
Please. (sobbing)

716
00:28:01,009 --> 00:28:02,4
I'm coming with you.

717
00:28:02,068 --> 00:28:04,2
No, I can't let you do that.

718
00:28:04,047 --> 00:28:05,7
I'm not gonna call this in,
but you have to stay here.

719
00:28:05,097 --> 00:28:07,6
No discussion.
I'm coming with you.

720
00:28:07,081 --> 00:28:09,0
Fine.

721
00:28:09,023 --> 00:28:11,6
You'll have to wait in the car.

722
00:28:11,081 --> 00:28:14,4
♪♪

723
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,5
Ten more minutes.

724
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,8
Patience.

725
00:28:40,001 --> 00:28:41,9
Something doesn't feel right.

726
00:28:42,018 --> 00:28:44,5
Well, of course it doesn't.
It's a kidnapping.

727
00:28:45,068 --> 00:28:47,7
Cool ranch puff?

728
00:28:47,097 --> 00:28:48,7
No, thanks.

729
00:28:48,097 --> 00:28:50,7
- No?
- Mm.

730
00:28:50,098 --> 00:28:52,7
It's funny, isn't it?
You'd think the king of hellfire

731
00:28:52,098 --> 00:28:56,4
would be more of a flaming hot
guy, but love these bad boys.

732
00:28:56,069 --> 00:28:59,9
Okay, let's say
you really are the Devil.

733
00:29:00,019 --> 00:29:02,4
All-powerful, immortal,
blah, blah, blah.

734
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:04,3
Does that mean
you don't feel pain at all?

735
00:29:04,053 --> 00:29:05,3
Hmm.

736
00:29:05,053 --> 00:29:06,9
I like this line of questioning.

737
00:29:07,012 --> 00:29:08,2
Does this mean
you're finally coming around?

738
00:29:08,049 --> 00:29:10,9
No. Just answer
the question.

739
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:14,1
(chuckles) Well, I...
I do feel something,

740
00:29:14,037 --> 00:29:16,5
but it's not pain
so much as, uh,

741
00:29:16,075 --> 00:29:18,9
a pressure, a nuisance, really.

742
00:29:19,017 --> 00:29:21,3
Okay, so what does it
feel like if you get shot?

743
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,1
Ow.

744
00:29:26,034 --> 00:29:27,8
Well, you asked.

745
00:29:28,001 --> 00:29:30,1
But that's it? Like, a
bullet just bounces off you?

746
00:29:30,031 --> 00:29:33,3
Well, there's no wound or blood,
if that's what you mean.

747
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:35,5
Can verify with something sharp
if you like.

748
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:38,0
No, it's not necessary.
It's tempting though.

749
00:29:38,027 --> 00:29:39,4
Huh.

750
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:42,2
So, does this mean
that you believe me?

751
00:29:42,044 --> 00:29:43,7
I'm afraid
I can't offer

752
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:46,1
anything obvious
like a tail as proof.

753
00:29:46,036 --> 00:29:48,0
- And so no horns.
- No, afraid not.

754
00:29:48,028 --> 00:29:49,6
That's the stuff
of movies and TV.

755
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:50,6
Mm-hmm.

756
00:29:50,083 --> 00:29:52,0
They always get it wrong.

757
00:29:52,025 --> 00:29:54,0
Well, look,
I-I (laughs) have to admit,

758
00:29:54,021 --> 00:29:55,7
I've seen some things
I can't explain,

759
00:29:55,092 --> 00:29:58,7
but I don't believe
in all that Bible stuff.

760
00:29:58,092 --> 00:30:00,8
So you're an atheist.
How ironic.

761
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:02,7
No, not exactly.

762
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:06,5
I do believe there's good
and evil and right and wrong.

763
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,0
But the whole
fiery damnation thing, no.

764
00:30:10,026 --> 00:30:11,1
Does it scare you?

765
00:30:11,031 --> 00:30:12,7
No, I mean, how could I be

766
00:30:12,093 --> 00:30:15,0
scared of something
that I don't believe in?

767
00:30:18,019 --> 00:30:21,0
Do I scare you?

768
00:30:23,023 --> 00:30:24,3
No.

769
00:30:29,041 --> 00:30:30,7
Is that Carver?

770
00:30:30,095 --> 00:30:31,9
Hmm?

771
00:30:34,008 --> 00:30:34,9
How did he get here?

772
00:30:35,016 --> 00:30:36,2
Oh, he must have followed us.

773
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:37,5
Well done, Detective.

774
00:30:37,075 --> 00:30:38,9
CHLOE:
No, he didn't follow us.

775
00:30:39,017 --> 00:30:40,5
He must have gotten
the address somehow.

776
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:42,0
Or someone told him.
Either way, he's gonna

777
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:44,1
get someone killed,
probably himself.

778
00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:48,6
This love thing makes you all
quite stupid, doesn't it?

779
00:31:02,098 --> 00:31:04,8
(whispers):
Lucifer!

780
00:31:09,045 --> 00:31:11,3
(whispers):
Lucifer!

781
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:16,9
(lock clicks)

782
00:31:17,016 --> 00:31:19,8
Sorry, but I gave
my word-- no police.

783
00:31:20,004 --> 00:31:21,1
Seriously?

784
00:31:21,033 --> 00:31:22,4
Don't worry, Detective.

785
00:31:22,067 --> 00:31:23,8
I'm immortal, remember?

786
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,9
I knew it.
(line ringing)

787
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:28,6
Hey, guys, I'm gonna need you
sooner than I thought.

788
00:31:28,088 --> 00:31:30,2
Is SWAT ready?

789
00:31:37,043 --> 00:31:39,3
♪♪

790
00:31:52,007 --> 00:31:52,9
(screams)

791
00:31:53,012 --> 00:31:53,7
(chuckles)

792
00:31:53,099 --> 00:31:54,9
Manly as ever.

793
00:31:55,012 --> 00:31:56,1
Why are you here?

794
00:31:56,037 --> 00:31:57,8
We had a perfectly
good plan in place.

795
00:31:58,004 --> 00:31:59,9
Well, after you left, the
kidnappers called back.

796
00:32:00,016 --> 00:32:01,4
They said they
changed their minds,

797
00:32:01,067 --> 00:32:03,9
and I come or
the deal's off.

798
00:32:04,013 --> 00:32:06,3
Oh, that sounds sinister.

799
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:09,4
Just hand over the cash,

800
00:32:09,067 --> 00:32:11,1
and no one gets hurt.

801
00:32:11,034 --> 00:32:13,6
Yes, right. Got it here.

802
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,4
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait! Where's Lindsay?!

803
00:32:15,068 --> 00:32:17,1
I want to see her.

804
00:32:17,031 --> 00:32:18,9
No. My rules.

805
00:32:19,018 --> 00:32:20,8
Money first.

806
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:23,1
Now, Mr. Kidnapper, I believe
that's a fair request actually,

807
00:32:23,035 --> 00:32:25,7
so just pop her around
and the money's yours.

808
00:32:28,044 --> 00:32:30,7
(grunting)

809
00:32:30,099 --> 00:32:32,2
Greedy little jackal,
aren't you?

810
00:32:32,045 --> 00:32:33,7
Give it to me!

811
00:32:33,099 --> 00:32:35,7
(chuckles)
Most certainly will not.

812
00:32:35,095 --> 00:32:37,8
CARVER:
Hey, f-forget it!

813
00:32:38,004 --> 00:32:39,6
Just-just give
it to him!

814
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,0
I just want her back.

815
00:32:43,017 --> 00:32:44,0
LUCIFER:
Fine.

816
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,4
Now bring us the girl.

817
00:32:46,067 --> 00:32:48,1
I'm sorry.

818
00:32:48,038 --> 00:32:49,3
That's not gonna happen.

819
00:32:49,059 --> 00:32:50,8
(chuckles)
What?

820
00:32:51,001 --> 00:32:51,8
I will kill you!

821
00:32:52,001 --> 00:32:53,0
Oh, it's gonna happen.

822
00:32:54,034 --> 00:32:55,8
A deal's a deal.

823
00:32:56,001 --> 00:32:58,0
I am not leaving here
without Lindsay.

824
00:32:58,026 --> 00:32:59,6
No way.

825
00:33:02,031 --> 00:33:04,2
(sighs)
Dearie me.

826
00:33:04,044 --> 00:33:06,6
What is it about you
and guns, eh?

827
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:09,5
(gunshot)

828
00:33:11,069 --> 00:33:13,5
Carver?

829
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,5
Oh, no.

830
00:33:18,041 --> 00:33:20,0
(groans)

831
00:33:21,033 --> 00:33:22,3
Lindsay?

832
00:33:22,058 --> 00:33:24,4
LUCIFER:
Wait. Lindsay Lindsay?

833
00:33:24,062 --> 00:33:26,3
Love of your life Lindsay?

834
00:33:26,054 --> 00:33:28,8
Yeah, sorry, but I can't
let you shoot my brother.

835
00:33:29,005 --> 00:33:31,0
What's up, jackass?

836
00:33:31,021 --> 00:33:31,9
I don't understand.

837
00:33:32,013 --> 00:33:34,0
Don't you though?

838
00:33:34,026 --> 00:33:37,2
This foul woman and her backwood
brother played the player.

839
00:33:37,043 --> 00:33:39,1
Lindsay kidnapped herself.

840
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:42,1
Hell truly hath no fury
like a woman scorned.

841
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:43,3
You did scorn her, didn't you?

842
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,0
No. No.

843
00:33:45,027 --> 00:33:48,1
For the first time in my life,
I didn't.

844
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,1
I loved her.

845
00:33:51,036 --> 00:33:53,5
I love you.

846
00:33:53,078 --> 00:33:55,3
Love me?

847
00:33:55,053 --> 00:33:56,6
Are you kidding?

848
00:33:56,082 --> 00:33:58,1
You didn't even
remember my name!

849
00:33:58,032 --> 00:34:00,2
What are you
talking about?

850
00:34:00,045 --> 00:34:02,2
I met you two years ago, Carver.

851
00:34:02,045 --> 00:34:03,5
We slept together.

852
00:34:04,096 --> 00:34:06,2
And then you never
called again.

853
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:08,7
Guess I was research
for your stupid book.

854
00:34:08,092 --> 00:34:10,4
No, no,
that's not possible.

855
00:34:10,067 --> 00:34:12,2
No, I-I would've remembered.

856
00:34:12,042 --> 00:34:13,5
Nope.

857
00:34:13,072 --> 00:34:15,1
I met you at the library.

858
00:34:15,034 --> 00:34:17,3
It's a good
place to score

859
00:34:17,059 --> 00:34:19,1
desperate babes.

860
00:34:19,035 --> 00:34:21,5
That's in Chapter 11, I believe.

861
00:34:21,076 --> 00:34:23,1
Oh, that's bad.

862
00:34:23,031 --> 00:34:24,5
I was a virgin, Carver.

863
00:34:24,073 --> 00:34:25,8
That's worse. (chuckles)

864
00:34:26,006 --> 00:34:27,2
It was just another
night for you,

865
00:34:27,048 --> 00:34:30,6
but it was a big deal for me.

866
00:34:30,082 --> 00:34:33,4
Oh, God, I'm...
I am so sorry, Lindsay.

867
00:34:33,065 --> 00:34:35,9
I-I'm different now.

868
00:34:36,011 --> 00:34:37,9
No, I don't think so.

869
00:34:38,007 --> 00:34:39,4
But I am.

870
00:34:39,066 --> 00:34:40,9
Okay, may I speak now?

871
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:42,6
Because I happen to be
an expert on punishment,

872
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:44,6
and I'm not sure
it fits the crime here.

873
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:46,6
I mean, Carver
made a mistake--

874
00:34:46,087 --> 00:34:48,2
well, several really--

875
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:50,1
but...

876
00:34:50,033 --> 00:34:51,3
you're different.

877
00:34:51,054 --> 00:34:52,6
He's changed.

878
00:34:52,084 --> 00:34:55,3
Doesn't that mean
anything to you?

879
00:34:56,059 --> 00:34:57,9
KEVIN:
Shut up.

880
00:34:58,018 --> 00:35:00,2
You shouldn't even
be here.

881
00:35:00,043 --> 00:35:01,7
Now you're dead, too.

882
00:35:01,093 --> 00:35:02,8
Shoot them, Linds.

883
00:35:03,006 --> 00:35:04,1
Sorry, can't let you

884
00:35:04,031 --> 00:35:05,8
do that, darling.

885
00:35:06,002 --> 00:35:07,4
I mean, I'm indestructible,

886
00:35:07,064 --> 00:35:08,8
but he's off limits as well,
I'm afraid.

887
00:35:09,002 --> 00:35:11,0
No, she's right. I-I deserve it.

888
00:35:11,023 --> 00:35:12,4
No, you don't.

889
00:35:12,061 --> 00:35:15,9
Chlamydia, the clap,
raging case of crabs--

890
00:35:16,019 --> 00:35:17,7
that's what you deserve,
not death.

891
00:35:19,007 --> 00:35:20,5
(chuckles softly):
And you...

892
00:35:21,066 --> 00:35:22,8
...how are you any better?

893
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,1
Why do humans think

894
00:35:24,037 --> 00:35:26,5
they can rectify
one evil with another?

895
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:28,8
(chuckles): I mean,
it's clearly the first time

896
00:35:29,004 --> 00:35:30,1
this reptile has
truly loved a woman,

897
00:35:30,037 --> 00:35:31,2
and this is his reward?

898
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:32,6
KEVIN:
Get away from her!

899
00:35:32,084 --> 00:35:35,2
(grunts, coughs)

900
00:35:37,063 --> 00:35:38,2
(gasps)

901
00:35:38,042 --> 00:35:39,2
Oh, God.

902
00:35:39,043 --> 00:35:41,0
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

903
00:35:41,022 --> 00:35:43,0
Please don't hurt me.

904
00:35:43,026 --> 00:35:44,3
(sobbing)

905
00:35:44,056 --> 00:35:45,6
Why does everyone say that

906
00:35:45,085 --> 00:35:46,8
before they're punished?

907
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:48,2
Don't kill me!

908
00:35:49,031 --> 00:35:50,6
Lucifer.

909
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:52,2
Don't move.

910
00:35:52,044 --> 00:35:53,6
LUCIFER: Detective,
you should leave.

911
00:35:55,053 --> 00:35:57,6
Who are you?

912
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:00,0
(Lindsay crying)

913
00:36:02,024 --> 00:36:04,2
What are you?

914
00:36:17,042 --> 00:36:19,1
CHLOE:
Did you do this?

915
00:36:19,034 --> 00:36:21,2
I've been trying to tell you,
I'm the Devil.

916
00:36:21,043 --> 00:36:22,6
(panting)

917
00:36:22,089 --> 00:36:24,8
That's... that's
not possible.

918
00:36:25,001 --> 00:36:26,3
I assure you, Detective, it is.

919
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,7
I mean, you've said yourself,

920
00:36:27,097 --> 00:36:29,7
there are things
you can't explain.

921
00:36:29,093 --> 00:36:31,9
You need more proof? You've got
the gun. Come on, shoot me.

922
00:36:32,019 --> 00:36:35,9
No.
I can't shoot you.

923
00:36:36,015 --> 00:36:38,4
Sure you can. Go on, give her
a squeeze, we'll be good to go.

924
00:36:38,065 --> 00:36:40,7
- No.
- Just shoot me, Detective!

925
00:36:40,099 --> 00:36:44,0
Please! Because maybe
you'll finally realize...

926
00:36:44,057 --> 00:36:46,2
(casing clatters on floor)

927
00:36:46,045 --> 00:36:47,6
Good for you!

928
00:36:48,054 --> 00:36:49,5
See?

929
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:50,7
Hardly hurts.

930
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,6
(distant sirens wailing)
I can't believe...

931
00:36:52,087 --> 00:36:54,9
Gah. Actually,
no, it's hurting a little bit.

932
00:36:55,017 --> 00:36:56,2
It's... Gah!
It's hurting a lot.

933
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:58,6
Son of a bitch,
that really hurts!

934
00:36:58,084 --> 00:36:59,9
(sirens wailing,
tires screeching)

935
00:37:01,067 --> 00:37:02,9
I'm bleeding.

936
00:37:03,018 --> 00:37:05,0
- You're bleeding.
- I'm bleeding.

937
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:07,1
Oh, crap,
of course you're bleeding.

938
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:08,3
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

939
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,0
God, what have I done?

940
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:11,9
I don't... I don't bleed.
It's... (grunts)

941
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:15,6
Lucifer,

942
00:37:15,081 --> 00:37:17,1
I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

943
00:37:17,036 --> 00:37:18,3
What does this mean?

944
00:37:18,057 --> 00:37:19,9
Well, it means I shot you.

945
00:37:20,019 --> 00:37:21,7
And I'm an idiot, and I'm sorry.

946
00:37:21,099 --> 00:37:23,9
And I'm in so much trouble.

947
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:26,3
Ah! It really hurts!

948
00:37:26,053 --> 00:37:28,3
(panting)

949
00:37:28,053 --> 00:37:31,0
(indistinct talking)

950
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,2
What's happening to me?

951
00:37:36,083 --> 00:37:38,7
(siren wails)

952
00:37:40,017 --> 00:37:42,1
(indistinct chatter)

953
00:37:42,038 --> 00:37:45,0
(talking indistinctly)

954
00:37:47,068 --> 00:37:49,5
(talking indistinctly)

955
00:37:49,072 --> 00:37:51,6
(talking, laughing)

956
00:37:51,085 --> 00:37:53,5
Well, speak of the devil.

957
00:37:53,077 --> 00:37:55,3
Mr. Morningstar here
was just telling me

958
00:37:55,052 --> 00:37:57,1
everything you did in there.

959
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,9
Right.
Well, Lieutenant...

960
00:38:00,015 --> 00:38:01,9
LUCIFER: I was just telling
your boss if you hadn't acted

961
00:38:02,019 --> 00:38:03,5
in the way that you did, then,

962
00:38:03,074 --> 00:38:05,5
well, all hell
would've broke loose.

963
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:06,7
Isn't that right?

964
00:38:07,091 --> 00:38:09,7
Right.

965
00:38:09,091 --> 00:38:10,7
Mm.

966
00:38:11,087 --> 00:38:13,5
Absolutely. And, um...

967
00:38:13,075 --> 00:38:16,3
But you caught the bad guys;
that's the main thing.

968
00:38:16,054 --> 00:38:17,8
OLIVIA: Again, I'm sorry
that you got caught

969
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,2
in the crossfire,
Mr. Morningstar.

970
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:21,2
Oh, it's just a graze.
I hardly felt it.

971
00:38:21,042 --> 00:38:22,5
(chuckles)

972
00:38:22,071 --> 00:38:24,7
And call me Lucifer.

973
00:38:26,093 --> 00:38:28,4
Lucifer.

974
00:38:29,072 --> 00:38:31,7
(Olivia chuckles)

975
00:38:33,081 --> 00:38:36,2
Thank you again
for all of your help.

976
00:38:36,048 --> 00:38:37,7
You are so welcome.

977
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:44,7
Bye, now.
(chuckles)

978
00:38:50,007 --> 00:38:51,5
I thought you
didn't lie.

979
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:52,9
I don't.

980
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:56,9
But I don't always tell
the whole truth. (chuckles)

981
00:38:57,016 --> 00:38:59,6
Thank you.

982
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:02,9
You're welcome.

983
00:39:03,013 --> 00:39:05,8
Come on, I'll
drive you home.

984
00:39:06,009 --> 00:39:08,2
I should bloody hope so,
now you've crippled me.

985
00:39:08,047 --> 00:39:09,8
Wuss.

986
00:39:10,001 --> 00:39:12,1
(chuckles)

987
00:39:15,077 --> 00:39:17,0
Thanks, Julia.

988
00:39:17,027 --> 00:39:19,1
Have a good night. Drive safe.

989
00:39:25,028 --> 00:39:27,6
Mommy!

990
00:39:27,082 --> 00:39:28,7
(chuckles):
Hey!

991
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:30,1
What are you doing up?

992
00:39:30,036 --> 00:39:32,4
Can't sleep when
you're not home.

993
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,8
Come on, I'll tuck you in.

994
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:35,6
What's that
on your shirt?

995
00:39:37,062 --> 00:39:41,6
Oh. Um, that's, uh...
that's ketchup from lunch.

996
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:44,3
Nuh-uh. That's blood, Mom.

997
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:46,7
Right. You're right.

998
00:39:46,096 --> 00:39:50,9
Well, um...
I may have hit someone...

999
00:39:51,018 --> 00:39:52,3
with a bullet.

1000
00:39:52,055 --> 00:39:54,6
You shot someone? Again?

1001
00:39:54,081 --> 00:39:55,7
Barely.

1002
00:39:55,097 --> 00:39:56,6
Who?

1003
00:39:56,089 --> 00:39:58,1
It was Lucifer.

1004
00:39:58,031 --> 00:39:59,4
- Is he okay?
- He's fine.

1005
00:39:59,069 --> 00:40:00,6
It was nothing.

1006
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:02,6
It was, like, a little graze.

1007
00:40:02,086 --> 00:40:04,6
Okay.

1008
00:40:06,098 --> 00:40:08,6
What, babe?

1009
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:11,7
Remember last week, I
told you that boy Noah

1010
00:40:11,091 --> 00:40:14,0
kept throwing French
fries at me at lunchtime?

1011
00:40:14,024 --> 00:40:15,9
- Mm-hmm.
- And you said

1012
00:40:16,016 --> 00:40:18,6
it actually might mean
he likes me?

1013
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:19,8
Yes.

1014
00:40:20,008 --> 00:40:22,8
Well, since you shot Lucifer,

1015
00:40:23,008 --> 00:40:26,6
it must mean
you really like him.

1016
00:40:26,084 --> 00:40:29,4
(sighs)

1017
00:40:29,063 --> 00:40:32,4
Hmm.

1018
00:40:32,068 --> 00:40:34,8
You know, it is bedtime,
you little weasel.

1019
00:40:35,005 --> 00:40:38,0
(both laugh)
You weasel. I'm gonna get you.

1020
00:40:38,027 --> 00:40:39,8
Story time! Story time!

1021
00:40:43,056 --> 00:40:45,1
(door opens)

1022
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,2
(Lucifer groans)

1023
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:49,1
(panting)

1024
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,5
I know.

1025
00:40:50,074 --> 00:40:52,2
Tough day at the office.

1026
00:40:52,041 --> 00:40:53,2
What happened to you?

1027
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:54,7
Oh, you'll never guess.

1028
00:40:54,095 --> 00:40:56,2
She shot me.

1029
00:40:56,045 --> 00:40:57,9
And I bled.

1030
00:40:58,012 --> 00:41:00,3
What?
That's not possible.

1031
00:41:00,058 --> 00:41:03,0
- I know.
- What's causing this?

1032
00:41:03,025 --> 00:41:05,3
Is there something
you're not telling me?

1033
00:41:05,054 --> 00:41:06,8
Don't think about it too much.
It's exciting.

1034
00:41:07,004 --> 00:41:08,2
No, it's dangerous.

1035
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:13,7
We've had our fun here, Lucifer,
but this can't happen.

1036
00:41:13,097 --> 00:41:15,4
(chuckles)

1037
00:41:15,064 --> 00:41:17,8
Tell me we're going home.

1038
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:20,2
On the contrary, Maze.

1039
00:41:21,073 --> 00:41:24,0
The fun's just begun.
