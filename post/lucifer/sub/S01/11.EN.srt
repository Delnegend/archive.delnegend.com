00:00:01,033 --> 00:00:04,7
- Previously on Lucifer...
- You're the Lord of Hell.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,2
Amenadiel is right--

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:07,3
you are changing.

4
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,0
You betrayed me, Maze.

5
00:00:09,021 --> 00:00:11,0
- Lucifer...
- I don't want to hear it.
We're done.

6
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,1
(flatlining)
AMENADIEL:
Enjoying the life I gave you?

7
00:00:14,034 --> 00:00:15,2
Do you want to go back?

8
00:00:15,047 --> 00:00:17,7
Because I can make that happen.

9
00:00:17,097 --> 00:00:20,8
LUCIFER: Seems I'm dealing with
a bit of a mortality sitch.

10
00:00:21,002 --> 00:00:22,3
I'm bleeding.

11
00:00:22,056 --> 00:00:24,6
All I have to do is wait
for some pitiful thug

12
00:00:24,085 --> 00:00:28,6
to end you,
and right back to Hell you go.

13
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,5
Who do you want me to kill?

14
00:00:30,074 --> 00:00:33,2
DAN: Lucifer Morningstar
deserves everything he gets,

15
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,6
but I can't let you kill him.

16
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:40,9
It would seem
that I'm saying no.

17
00:00:41,016 --> 00:00:42,1

Rosemary's baby.

00:01:44,089 --> 00:01:46,9
Oh, Detective,
it was extraordinary.

42
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,2
The heat, the gymnastics.

43
00:01:49,044 --> 00:01:52,2
(chuckles) I mean, you had moves
that made even the Devil blush.

44
00:01:52,044 --> 00:01:54,3
Oh, no, this is bad.

We didn't?

49
00:02:02,062 --> 00:02:04,4
Nope, I turned you down cold.

50
00:02:04,062 --> 00:02:06,8
You, the guy who's been trying
to get me into the sack

51
00:02:07,008 --> 00:02:10,2
since day one had a chance
to sleep with me,

and you did...?

00:02:11,042 --> 00:02:12,8
Why-why am I naked?

54
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,1
What, you mean you don't
remember the part

55
00:02:14,038 --> 00:02:16,3
where you passed out,
woke up again,

56
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:19,2
shouted at me, "It's too hot
in this five-story hellhole,"

57
00:02:19,043 --> 00:02:21,1
I believe it was,

58
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,1
then tore your clothes off
and proceeded to hog the bed?

59
00:02:23,031 --> 00:02:24,6
I do that. Sometimes.

60
00:02:24,081 --> 00:02:26,3
When I'm upset.

61
00:02:26,056 --> 00:02:28,9
And you'd be upset, too,
if your ex dumped you by text.

62
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:30,6
No, I'd be relieved
if Dan dumped me.

63
00:02:30,081 --> 00:02:32,4
Even still,

64
00:02:32,065 --> 00:02:34,2
it's very out of character
to see you so unhinged.

65
00:02:34,044 --> 00:02:36,5
And out of character
for me, too.

66
00:02:36,078 --> 00:02:38,7
The whole "not wanting
to have sex with you" thing.

67
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,4
I mean, here's
the strange part.

68
00:02:40,066 --> 00:02:42,7
This gave me quite a rush.

69
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:44,3
Can't explain it.

70
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:45,9
I've been thinking
about it all night.

71
00:02:46,016 --> 00:02:48,9
Okay, last night was a fluke.

72
00:02:49,017 --> 00:02:50,4
For both of us.

73
00:02:50,067 --> 00:02:52,7
Never happened,
leave it at that.

74
00:02:52,096 --> 00:02:53,7
Right.

75
00:02:56,013 --> 00:02:58,3

If we were on speaking terms,
perhaps I'd fill you in.

and I'll let you

after our sleepover
last night.

96
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:45,8
What's the hole at the back for?

97
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:46,8
Not mine.

98
00:03:47,002 --> 00:03:48,1
Those are not mine.

99
00:03:48,035 --> 00:03:49,8
(chuckles)
More of a commando girl.

100
00:03:50,002 --> 00:03:51,1
Fair enough.

101
00:03:51,035 --> 00:03:52,6
Dearie me.

102
00:03:52,085 --> 00:03:55,1
Someone woke up on the
wrong side of a.38.

103
00:03:55,036 --> 00:03:57,7
(sighs) Yeah, single
gunshot wound to the chest.

104
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,2
No wallet.

105
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:01,8
Tan marks where a ring
and a watch were lifted.

106
00:04:02,003 --> 00:04:03,5
A staircase
robbery.

107
00:04:03,078 --> 00:04:05,7
Is that a
thing now?

108
00:04:05,091 --> 00:04:07,3
CHLOE:
This is the Dunlear Foundation.

109
00:04:07,058 --> 00:04:09,5
They help the homeless
and the underprivileged.

110
00:04:09,075 --> 00:04:11,8
So, who's the dashing corpse?

111
00:04:12,008 --> 00:04:14,8
Tim Dunlear himself,
head of the foundation,

112
00:04:15,008 --> 00:04:17,8
former NBA star,
notorious playboy.

113
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:20,2
He was into drugs,
gambling, women.

114
00:04:20,042 --> 00:04:21,9
My typical Wednesday.

115
00:04:22,018 --> 00:04:24,7
But then he left pro ball
and he turned his life around.

116
00:04:24,093 --> 00:04:27,3
He dedicated himself
to philanthropy.

117
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,7
He was beloved.

118
00:04:28,093 --> 00:04:31,7
Right, bad boy turned good.

119
00:04:31,094 --> 00:04:33,2
It's interesting.

120
00:04:33,044 --> 00:04:34,5
Are you Emmett Toussaint?

121
00:04:34,077 --> 00:04:36,4
You found the body?

122
00:04:36,061 --> 00:04:38,5
I'm Detective Decker. Can
you tell us what happened?

123
00:04:38,073 --> 00:04:41,4
I volunteer for the
foundation's outreach program.

124
00:04:41,061 --> 00:04:44,2
Came here to meet him,
and he was just lying here.

125
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,1
How did you know Mr. Dunlear?

126
00:04:46,028 --> 00:04:48,7
He sponsored me to come to L.A.
after the earthquake in Haiti.

127
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:50,0
Tim was my mentor.

128
00:04:50,025 --> 00:04:52,0
Handsome and saintly.

129
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,3
Did you see anyone
else at the scene

130
00:04:53,058 --> 00:04:54,6
or notice anything strange?

131
00:04:54,087 --> 00:04:56,6
There was a guy outside.

132
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:58,3
He ran when he saw me.

133
00:04:58,054 --> 00:04:59,9
I gave the cops a description.

134
00:05:00,013 --> 00:05:01,6
Think he was
homeless.

135
00:05:01,088 --> 00:05:05,5
Did Mr. Dunlear ever speak
of a certain philanthropic high

136
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,2
after one of his selfless acts?

137
00:05:07,043 --> 00:05:09,0
You know,
for example,

138
00:05:09,022 --> 00:05:11,1
say when he chose not to sleep
with a drunken woman?

139
00:05:11,031 --> 00:05:14,2
What?

140
00:05:14,044 --> 00:05:15,2
Did I say
something wrong?

141
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:18,2
We are questioning a minor.

142
00:05:19,061 --> 00:05:22,1
I'm sorry about
your mentor.

143
00:05:22,032 --> 00:05:24,3
We'll call you if we
have any more questions.

144
00:05:27,049 --> 00:05:29,3
What? I just feel
quite connected

145
00:05:29,053 --> 00:05:31,3
to our victim.

146
00:05:31,054 --> 00:05:33,6
You are nothing
like Tim Dunlear.

147
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,4
Bad boy with
a heart of gold?

148
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:37,1
I am everything like Tim.

149
00:05:37,033 --> 00:05:38,7
May as well be solving
my own murder.

150
00:05:38,092 --> 00:05:40,7
Only you could turn
a tragic death

151
00:05:40,092 --> 00:05:43,0
into an excuse
to talk about you.

152
00:05:43,026 --> 00:05:44,5
(scoffs)

153
00:05:44,067 --> 00:05:46,8
Well, who else would
I talk about?

Probably not.

159
00:06:04,032 --> 00:06:05,8
I'll bet the SWAT
team's about

160
00:06:06,003 --> 00:06:08,8
to bust down the
door any minute.

161

in a city of four
million people.

163
00:06:13,058 --> 00:06:17,3
As much as I hate Lucifer,
I'm not gonna let you kill him.

164
00:06:17,058 --> 00:06:19,8
Oh, I'm not gonna
do anything. No. Oh.

165
00:06:21,092 --> 00:06:23,5
But you know who
would want him dead?

166
00:06:23,076 --> 00:06:25,6
Someone who's jealous.

167
00:06:25,088 --> 00:06:27,3
Someone who hates the fact

168
00:06:27,055 --> 00:06:30,2
that he's clearly got
a thing for his ex-wife.

169
00:06:31,047 --> 00:06:34,3
Ooh.

170
00:06:34,052 --> 00:06:38,1
Someone whose fingerprints I put
all over the murder weapon.

171
00:06:38,035 --> 00:06:39,6
Sound like anyone you know, Dan?

172
00:06:41,002 --> 00:06:41,9
(laughing):
Ooh.

173
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:45,0
Don't go anywhere.

174
00:06:52,008 --> 00:06:53,4
(door closes)

WOMAN:
My husband was so generous.

176
00:06:54,091 --> 00:06:57,2
If they had just asked for help,

177
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,8
he would have given
them anything.

178
00:06:59,004 --> 00:07:01,4
What kind of person would
do something like this?

179
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:03,2
Well, how much time
do you have?

180
00:07:03,042 --> 00:07:06,1
Tim would be devastated
to know we've got to cancel

181
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:07,4
the fund-raising gala.

182
00:07:07,067 --> 00:07:09,2
WOMAN:
You're right, Kyle.

183
00:07:09,043 --> 00:07:11,0
Well, we wouldn't want
to devastate our fallen hero.

184
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,9
The show must go on.

185
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,2
This is an active
crime scene.

186

an event here.

00:07:21,044 --> 00:07:23,9
You can hold your
benefit at my club.

191
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:25,1
I don't know.
LUCIFER:
No, no, your husband

192
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,5
was a kindred spirit,

193
00:07:26,073 --> 00:07:28,8
and I pledge to carry on
his good work

194
00:07:29,007 --> 00:07:32,5
and personally find--
and punish-- his killer.

195
00:07:32,074 --> 00:07:35,8
Tim always said
"Tragedy brings sorrow

196
00:07:36,008 --> 00:07:37,3
but also true good."

197
00:07:37,058 --> 00:07:38,3
Aw.

198
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:40,0
Thank you.

What is with you today?

204
00:07:54,043 --> 00:07:55,5
It was rather benevolent of me,

offering up Lux,

206
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:59,2
Well, one good deed
doesn't make you a saint.

207
00:07:59,048 --> 00:08:01,4
Well, last I counted,
it was two good deeds.

208
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:04,1
But, uh, I'm not feeling
the same rush as before.

209
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,9
Perhaps I'm gonna
have to up my game.

221
00:08:39,031 --> 00:08:42,5
No, but I mean it's like
a literal rush, a high.

Well, yes, and offering Lux
to the Dunlear Foundation,

226

not to mention vowing
to find Tim's killer.

Hmm. You like the way

- Mm.
- But true good needs

231
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:10,0
to come from a place
of selflessness, authenticity.

232
00:09:10,025 --> 00:09:11,7
Well, of course.

233
00:09:11,096 --> 00:09:14,0

And you're welcome.

Okay, my point is, it's
wonderful that you're evolving.

238
00:09:25,077 --> 00:09:26,6
Right.

320
00:12:23,036 --> 00:12:24,7

to kill your husband?

321
00:12:24,099 --> 00:12:26,5
I thought this was a robbery.

322
00:12:26,074 --> 00:12:28,1
LUCIFER:
No, turns out

323
00:12:28,037 --> 00:12:29,7

- Oh.

335
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:46,5

342
00:12:57,069 --> 00:12:58,9
But I want
to discuss...

343
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:00,6
My client is grieving.

344
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:02,1
You have any questions,
you talk to me.

345
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:03,7
All right, can you establish

346
00:13:03,099 --> 00:13:05,8
Vanessa's whereabouts at
the time of Tim's death?

347
00:13:06,003 --> 00:13:07,7
Are you accusing
my client of murder?

348
00:13:07,091 --> 00:13:10,4
No, but one quarter of murders
are committed by family members.

349
00:13:10,066 --> 00:13:12,5
Yes, and half by acquaintances.

350
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,1
Which gets to my next question.

351
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:15,6
Where were you the
night of Tim's death?

352
00:13:15,088 --> 00:13:17,5
Listen, you can look
at me all you want.

353
00:13:17,071 --> 00:13:20,4
But Tim came into contact with a
lot of people around this place.

354
00:13:20,063 --> 00:13:22,3
Desperate people.

355
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:25,5
Why do I get the feeling you
have someone specific in mind?

356
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,6
Did you ever
fight with Tim?

357
00:13:30,047 --> 00:13:32,6
Last night.

358
00:13:32,081 --> 00:13:34,7
You didn't tell me that earlier.

359
00:13:34,098 --> 00:13:36,3
I was ashamed.

360
00:13:36,056 --> 00:13:38,2
Tim told me
I might not be receiving

he promised.

Said some things.

364

I was going
to go apologize, but...

365
00:13:49,087 --> 00:13:52,1

366

Whatever you need.

369
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,5
First, I want you

370
00:14:03,071 --> 00:14:04,8
Tim and his relationship

371
00:14:05,005 --> 00:14:06,8
with Vanessa--
what was it like?

372
00:14:07,005 --> 00:14:08,9
Great...

373
00:14:09,018 --> 00:14:10,6
when the cameras were on.

374
00:14:10,089 --> 00:14:12,7
And when they were off?

375
00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:16,8
LUCIFER:
Ah, Detective, you made it.

376
00:14:17,006 --> 00:14:18,7
A little underdressed,
but okay.

377
00:14:18,098 --> 00:14:20,6
What happened with
the orphan child?

378
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:22,8
We're holding him,
waiting on ballistics.

379
00:14:23,007 --> 00:14:25,6
But he had a lot to say about
the Dunlears' perfect marriage.

380
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:28,2
Apparently Tim hadn't
slept at home in months.

381
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,6
Well, it's probably
all those good deeds.

382
00:14:29,082 --> 00:14:31,1
So time-consuming.

383
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,1
Or... I was right.

384
00:14:33,037 --> 00:14:34,7
And Tim was back
to his old ways.

385
00:14:34,095 --> 00:14:36,5
You know, that key card
we found in his wallet

386
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,4
was from a hotel, so maybe
he was cheating on Vanessa,

387
00:14:38,062 --> 00:14:39,8
she found out,

388
00:14:40,008 --> 00:14:41,4
- then decided to...
- Punish the cheating bastard

389
00:14:41,063 --> 00:14:42,8
by pumping him full of lead.

390
00:14:43,009 --> 00:14:44,8
Well, that's option "A."

391
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,0
Option "B" is the lawyer isn't
telling us everything he knows.

392
00:14:46,022 --> 00:14:47,6
Option "C" is

393
00:14:47,088 --> 00:14:49,5
an emotionally distraught
mistress did him in.

394
00:14:49,076 --> 00:14:51,8
Ah, that old chestnut--
if I can't have him, no one can.

395
00:14:52,005 --> 00:14:53,2
What did you get from Vanessa?

396
00:14:53,043 --> 00:14:54,3
- Is that why we're here?
- Yes, yes.

397
00:14:54,052 --> 00:14:55,7
She asked me to have lunch

398
00:14:55,093 --> 00:14:57,2
with the golden donors
of the foundation

399
00:14:57,048 --> 00:14:58,7
on her behalf.

400
00:14:58,098 --> 00:15:00,0
It's the least I could do.

401
00:15:00,023 --> 00:15:01,7
Oh, the very least.

402
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,8
What better way to get intel
on a murder than a gaggle

403
00:15:04,007 --> 00:15:05,0
of high-society frenemies?

404
00:15:05,023 --> 00:15:06,6
- Oh.
- Ah!

405
00:15:06,082 --> 00:15:08,2
WOMAN:
Tim Dunlear

406
00:15:08,045 --> 00:15:09,9
was a true humanitarian.

407
00:15:10,011 --> 00:15:11,9
Oh, there's
so few of us around.

408
00:15:12,016 --> 00:15:13,7
And I have no one
to help me process my grief.

409
00:15:13,095 --> 00:15:15,5
Can you believe
my therapist had the nerve

410
00:15:15,074 --> 00:15:16,9
to go on maternity leave?

411
00:15:17,012 --> 00:15:18,7
Oh, well,
I'm here for you, Gayle.

412
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,7
You can tell me anything.

413
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,5
Oh.

414
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,7
Oh, ooh...

415
00:15:23,096 --> 00:15:27,6
You are a good man.

416
00:15:27,084 --> 00:15:29,3
Yeah, not quite the reaction

417
00:15:29,059 --> 00:15:32,2
I was looking for,
but, uh, when in Rome.

418
00:15:32,047 --> 00:15:33,4
To Tim Dunlear.

419
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,1
We all loved him.

420
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:37,9
Mm-hmm, some more than others.

421
00:15:38,014 --> 00:15:39,6
So you heard about Donna Gray?

422
00:15:39,081 --> 00:15:41,6
- Oh, yeah.
- So sad.

423
00:15:41,085 --> 00:15:43,9
Throwing yourself
at a married man like that.

424
00:15:44,015 --> 00:15:45,6
Mm, and when they started
sleeping together,

425
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:47,7
poor Vanessa.

426
00:15:47,094 --> 00:15:49,8
Tim turned Donna down cold.

427
00:15:50,003 --> 00:15:51,6
Not that it's any

428
00:15:51,082 --> 00:15:52,9
of your business.

429
00:15:53,016 --> 00:15:54,4
Oh.

430
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,5
Tight-lipped and angry.

431
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,3
Yes, well,
with all that Botox,

432
00:16:00,054 --> 00:16:02,8
I'm surprised
she can chew at all.

433
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:05,1
This is taking too long-- maybe
we should do your hypnotism,

434
00:16:05,029 --> 00:16:07,9
- eye-voodoo thing
to get them talking.
- Yes.

435
00:16:08,017 --> 00:16:10,1
You would expect that sort of
behavior from me, wouldn't you?

436
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:12,3
Yeah, you making a spectacle
to help out a case.

437
00:16:12,051 --> 00:16:13,9
Yeah, it's what you do.

438
00:16:14,018 --> 00:16:15,5
Don't worry, Detective.
There'll be a spectacle.

439
00:16:15,076 --> 00:16:17,3
These women

440
00:16:17,056 --> 00:16:19,8
are lonely and unappreciated.

441
00:16:20,002 --> 00:16:21,9
If I give them what they want,
they'll give us what we want.

442
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:24,4
Hello, ladies.

443
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:27,9
Thank you all so much
for coming today.

444
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:29,8
Uh, you've all given so
generously over the years

445
00:16:30,003 --> 00:16:32,0
to the Dunlear Foundation.

446
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:34,1
In honor of our fallen hero,

447
00:16:34,037 --> 00:16:35,7
I now give you a gift

448
00:16:35,091 --> 00:16:36,8
in return.
(women oohing)

449
00:16:36,099 --> 00:16:38,4
(chuckles)
Me.

450
00:16:38,066 --> 00:16:41,3
(women clamoring)

451
00:16:41,058 --> 00:16:42,6

Why-why are you

468
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:27,3
Tim is dead!

469
00:17:27,054 --> 00:17:29,3
Shame on you.

470
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:32,3
And shame on all of you.

471
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:35,2
(scattered murmurs)

472
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:38,0
And I give you option "D."

473
00:17:38,022 --> 00:17:39,5
Let's go.

474
00:17:39,076 --> 00:17:41,0
- I love you.
- Thank you.

475
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:47,3
It's true.
(crying)

476
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,4
I loved him.

477
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,0
Kyle, Tim Dunlear
was a hero to all of us.

478
00:17:52,028 --> 00:17:53,1
No, no.

479
00:17:53,032 --> 00:17:55,1
You don't understand.

480
00:17:56,074 --> 00:17:59,4
Tim and I were in love.

481
00:17:59,066 --> 00:18:01,0
- Oh.
- Oh.

482
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:02,7
Right,

483
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,2
so Tim was cheating
on his wife with a man.

484
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,9
I did not see that coming.

485
00:18:07,017 --> 00:18:08,9
The Devil usually has
impeccable gaydar.

486
00:18:09,013 --> 00:18:11,6
Tim was, uh, in denial

487
00:18:11,084 --> 00:18:13,6
about his sexuality for years.

488
00:18:13,084 --> 00:18:16,9
And then, um...

489
00:18:17,009 --> 00:18:18,8
we met.

490
00:18:19,001 --> 00:18:20,6
Hmm, that explains why
he was never at home

491
00:18:20,089 --> 00:18:22,3
and all the secrecy.

492
00:18:22,051 --> 00:18:24,1
Did you two ever
meet at a hotel?

493
00:18:24,035 --> 00:18:25,6
No.

494
00:18:25,089 --> 00:18:27,3
No, that-that
would've been too public.

495
00:18:27,052 --> 00:18:30,4
Uh, we only ever met
at my apartment.

496
00:18:30,069 --> 00:18:31,7
Huh.
What about Vanessa?

497
00:18:31,098 --> 00:18:32,9
Did she know?

498
00:18:33,019 --> 00:18:34,8
They, um,

499
00:18:35,003 --> 00:18:36,1
you know,
they-they had an arrangement.

500
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:38,7
Tim wanted it kept secret.

501
00:18:38,095 --> 00:18:40,9
And Vanessa agreed.

502
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,5
She needed
the Tim Dunlear brand.

503
00:18:44,075 --> 00:18:46,5
Monogamy fails again.

504
00:18:46,075 --> 00:18:48,3
So, if Tim didn't
want out of the closet,

505
00:18:48,054 --> 00:18:50,8
were you aware of anyone that
would want to blackmail him?

506
00:18:51,009 --> 00:18:52,5
Or threaten to
go to the press?

507
00:18:52,071 --> 00:18:53,7
No.

508
00:18:53,092 --> 00:18:54,8
Um...

509
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,7
But Tim texted me this photo

510
00:18:58,093 --> 00:19:00,0
for safekeeping.

511
00:19:00,022 --> 00:19:02,3
I... I have no idea

512
00:19:02,055 --> 00:19:04,8
what it means.

513
00:19:05,002 --> 00:19:07,2
- Hmm.
- It's actually
the last I ever

514
00:19:07,043 --> 00:19:09,1
heard from him before...

515
00:19:10,069 --> 00:19:12,4
(sighs)

516
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:14,5
Do you want another song?

517
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:20,2
If there's one thing I know
about kimchi fried rice,

518
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:24,4
it's that heat really
kicks things up a notch.

519
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,9
You almost died.
You came back,

520
00:19:27,012 --> 00:19:28,5
and this is what you do
with your second chance?

521
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:35,3
You know what happens
when you die?

522
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,5
I can't say I do.

523
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:40,1
Well, if you've lived a life

524
00:19:40,034 --> 00:19:43,0
like I did, you go to Hell.

525
00:19:43,026 --> 00:19:44,5
Oh, yeah.

526
00:19:44,076 --> 00:19:47,5
In my case, it was for
a couple of seconds.

527
00:19:47,077 --> 00:19:50,8
Down there, though,
it was years...

528
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,7
and years.

529
00:19:52,094 --> 00:19:54,4
And there's a door
just for you.

530
00:19:54,061 --> 00:19:56,7
And inside, Hell

531
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:59,3
uses what you
love against you.

532
00:19:59,053 --> 00:20:02,6
For me, I love life.

533
00:20:02,087 --> 00:20:05,5
Everything about it.
Got a hunger for it.

534
00:20:05,074 --> 00:20:07,9
So...

535
00:20:08,016 --> 00:20:10,1
they starved me.

536
00:20:10,037 --> 00:20:11,9
No food.

537
00:20:12,017 --> 00:20:13,7
No other people.

538
00:20:13,096 --> 00:20:15,1
No nothing.

539
00:20:15,034 --> 00:20:16,9
No TV.
(chuckles)

540
00:20:17,013 --> 00:20:18,4
Malcolm?

541
00:20:18,063 --> 00:20:19,9
Hmm?

542
00:20:20,013 --> 00:20:21,2
You need help.

543
00:20:24,093 --> 00:20:27,1
(laughs)

544
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,9
You always were a scrappy one.

545
00:20:31,014 --> 00:20:33,7
Ah.

546
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:36,4
Yeah.

547
00:20:36,061 --> 00:20:39,0
I do need help.

548
00:20:39,028 --> 00:20:41,1
Never to go back.

549
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:42,6
So I made a deal.

550
00:20:42,086 --> 00:20:44,4
And all I got to do

551
00:20:44,066 --> 00:20:46,9
is put a bullet in Lucifer.

552
00:20:47,016 --> 00:20:49,4
I pull the trigger.

553
00:20:49,066 --> 00:20:51,4
(clicks tongue)

554
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:53,5
You take the fall.

555
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:56,7
Huh?

556
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,1
Huh? Huh?

557
00:21:08,064 --> 00:21:11,2
Five-second rule.

558
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:14,9
(laughs)

559
00:21:20,032 --> 00:21:21,8
TIM:
Teaching,

560
00:21:22,007 --> 00:21:23,6
building,

561
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:25,3
creating.

562
00:21:25,053 --> 00:21:26,8
I'm Tim Dunlear.

563
00:21:27,007 --> 00:21:28,3
Together we can
educate Haiti today

564
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:30,5
for their better tomorrow.

565
00:21:33,054 --> 00:21:35,5
(knocking)

566
00:21:41,017 --> 00:21:43,0
Mr. Fleming?

567
00:21:43,022 --> 00:21:44,5
What are you doing here?

568
00:21:44,072 --> 00:21:46,1
I understand
you've been asking

569
00:21:46,034 --> 00:21:47,9
some pretty invasive
questions at a luncheon.

570
00:21:48,018 --> 00:21:50,1
I have reason to believe
that your client

571
00:21:50,035 --> 00:21:52,8
knows more than she's letting on
about her husband's death.

572
00:21:53,006 --> 00:21:54,8
Vanessa Dunlear's entire world
has fallen apart.

573
00:21:55,006 --> 00:21:57,3
I mean, what kind of a person
targets a-a grieving woman?

574
00:21:57,056 --> 00:21:59,3
A very rich grieving woman

575
00:21:59,052 --> 00:22:01,0
who stands to inherit
her husband's estate.

576
00:22:01,023 --> 00:22:04,1
Every cent that Tim had
goes back into that foundation.

577
00:22:06,007 --> 00:22:07,6
Which you would know,

578
00:22:07,086 --> 00:22:09,6
because now that Tim's gone,
you took control.

579
00:22:09,087 --> 00:22:11,4
That's an interesting
turn of events.

580
00:22:11,062 --> 00:22:13,3
You are messing with
the wrong people, Detective.

581
00:22:13,058 --> 00:22:15,2
Good people.

582
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:16,2
Back off.

583
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,0
♪ I want you... ♪

584
00:22:23,026 --> 00:22:24,9
(Lucifer exhales)

585
00:22:25,013 --> 00:22:27,3
You'd never know that Lux was
a den of iniquity, would you?

586
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:30,1
Well, as long as you don't
look too closely at the floors.

587
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:32,1
Will Fleming wants
to scare me off?

588
00:22:32,031 --> 00:22:33,9
Bring it on.

589
00:22:34,014 --> 00:22:36,2
Question is, whether he's
protecting himself or Vanessa.

590
00:22:36,048 --> 00:22:38,8
Or maybe
they're just good people.

591
00:22:39,002 --> 00:22:40,2
Because you're
suddenly the authority?

592
00:22:40,044 --> 00:22:41,6
Give me a break.

593
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:44,8
Detective,
even if Vanessa is guilty,

594
00:22:45,007 --> 00:22:47,4
this is a woman who's denied
herself carbs since the '90s

595
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:49,0
and stayed married
to a gay man.

596
00:22:49,028 --> 00:22:50,9
If she doesn't want
to talk, she won't.

597
00:22:51,016 --> 00:22:52,7
And as for their attorney,

598
00:22:52,095 --> 00:22:54,2
well, he certainly
doesn't strike me

599
00:22:54,045 --> 00:22:55,7
- as the confessional type.
- Okay.

600
00:22:55,095 --> 00:22:58,2
Maybe I can't get them to talk,
but you can.

601
00:22:58,046 --> 00:22:59,5
Come on.

602
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:00,7
I've seen you do it
dozens of times.

603
00:23:00,092 --> 00:23:01,7
No.

604
00:23:01,092 --> 00:23:03,1
Not here. Not tonight.

605
00:23:03,034 --> 00:23:04,8
Am I missing something?

606
00:23:05,001 --> 00:23:06,7
I feel like you're protecting
our main suspects.

607
00:23:06,097 --> 00:23:08,7
No, I'm just thinking
about the children.

608
00:23:08,093 --> 00:23:12,0
You want to push pause
on a murder investigation

609
00:23:12,022 --> 00:23:13,7
so you can have a party?

610
00:23:13,097 --> 00:23:15,2
Detective, I made a promise.

611
00:23:15,047 --> 00:23:17,2
The ladies,
the-the foundation,

612
00:23:17,048 --> 00:23:19,6
the proud nation of Haiti...

613
00:23:19,081 --> 00:23:21,0
they're all depending on me

614
00:23:21,027 --> 00:23:22,3
tonight.

615
00:23:22,052 --> 00:23:24,1
Now, Tim Dunlear may be dead,

616
00:23:24,032 --> 00:23:25,7
but his legacy lives on,

617
00:23:25,098 --> 00:23:28,0
and right now he needs to go
change into his tux.

618
00:23:28,028 --> 00:23:30,9
It's about the greater good,
Detective.

619
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,8
The greater good would be
parking your ego

620
00:23:34,008 --> 00:23:35,4
and helping catch the bad guy.

621
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:37,8
The old Lucifer
would have known that.

622
00:23:38,004 --> 00:23:38,9
Wh...

623
00:23:39,016 --> 00:23:41,0
I miss him, by the way.

624
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:44,6
At least he had my back.

625
00:23:44,084 --> 00:23:46,8
(exhales)

626
00:23:47,001 --> 00:23:48,8
Detective!

627
00:23:54,026 --> 00:23:56,5
(mellow jazz playing)

628
00:23:58,089 --> 00:24:00,2
(inhales)

629
00:24:00,048 --> 00:24:02,2
Oh...

630
00:24:02,044 --> 00:24:04,3
Glad someone's
having a good night.

631
00:24:07,019 --> 00:24:08,4
What are you doing here?

632
00:24:08,069 --> 00:24:10,7
You've ruined my life.

633
00:24:10,095 --> 00:24:13,4
The least I could do
is ruin your night.

634
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:15,5
Enjoy your evening.

635
00:24:16,091 --> 00:24:18,1
How'd you even
find me, Maze?

636
00:24:18,037 --> 00:24:20,2
Followed the sweet stench
of failure.

637
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:22,0
(laughs)

638
00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:23,9
Look, don't blame me
for your problems, all right?

639
00:24:24,013 --> 00:24:25,1
It's not my fault

640
00:24:25,034 --> 00:24:26,5
that you betrayed your boss.

641
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,2
My problems are your problems.

642
00:24:30,047 --> 00:24:32,8
Which would be the only thing
that you and I have in common.

643
00:24:33,005 --> 00:24:34,1
And so you came here because...

644
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,4
...because you have

645
00:24:37,064 --> 00:24:38,6
nowhere else to go?

646
00:24:38,089 --> 00:24:40,8
Yes, I do.

647
00:24:41,006 --> 00:24:42,6
I have lots of places to go.

648
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:45,2
Lots of places.

649
00:24:45,048 --> 00:24:47,6
And because you have
no one else to talk to, either.

650
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:48,6
(chuckles)

651
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:50,5
Says the angel sitting here

652
00:24:50,074 --> 00:24:52,8
eating a medium rare steak

653
00:24:53,007 --> 00:24:54,3
by himself.

654
00:25:03,096 --> 00:25:06,0
What?

655
00:25:06,021 --> 00:25:08,0
It's not like you were
going to drink it.

656
00:25:08,021 --> 00:25:09,0
You're so boring.

657
00:25:09,017 --> 00:25:10,7
I'm actually not boring.

658
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:12,7
I'm pretty exciting.

659
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:19,8
My definition of "excitement"

660
00:25:20,006 --> 00:25:21,6
is fun.

661
00:25:21,081 --> 00:25:23,3
Danger.

662
00:25:23,052 --> 00:25:24,6
Sex.

663
00:25:25,085 --> 00:25:27,1
Spontaneity.

664
00:25:27,036 --> 00:25:29,0
You are none of those things.

665
00:25:32,069 --> 00:25:33,5
Yes, I am.

666
00:25:33,074 --> 00:25:35,0
Give me one example.

667
00:25:39,016 --> 00:25:41,4
You know that story
about Lucifer and the goat?

668
00:25:41,066 --> 00:25:43,9
Yeah?

669
00:25:45,092 --> 00:25:47,2
No.

670
00:25:49,009 --> 00:25:49,6
That was you?

671
00:25:49,088 --> 00:25:51,0
That was me.

672
00:25:51,025 --> 00:25:52,2
A whisper here,

673
00:25:52,042 --> 00:25:55,3
a divine
appearance there...

674
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:57,2
Word got around.

675
00:25:57,043 --> 00:25:58,7
He hates the goat thing.

676
00:25:58,093 --> 00:26:00,0
I know!

677
00:26:00,026 --> 00:26:01,2
(laughing)
He could never figure out

678
00:26:01,043 --> 00:26:03,0
where it came from.

679
00:26:03,027 --> 00:26:05,6
You know, I've waited a thousand
years to tell someone that.

680
00:26:05,089 --> 00:26:07,7
(chuckles)

681
00:26:12,086 --> 00:26:14,1
Leave the bottle.

682
00:26:19,045 --> 00:26:21,1
Thank you for this, Kyle. I know
it's your job on the line.

683
00:26:21,033 --> 00:26:22,2
Whatever it takes.

684
00:26:24,058 --> 00:26:25,5
I want to find who did this.

685
00:26:26,071 --> 00:26:28,1
Thank you.

686
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:32,9
So this here, this
last text from Tim--

687
00:26:33,017 --> 00:26:34,4
looks like it was
from Port-au-Prince.

688
00:26:34,063 --> 00:26:35,5
KYLE:
Tim didn't tell me

689
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,0
he was going there.

690
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,4
It wasn't on his calendar.

691
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,4
Could he have traveled
under the radar?

692
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,4
Sometimes he booked
his own travel.

693
00:26:46,069 --> 00:26:47,8
He-he had some buddies

694
00:26:48,002 --> 00:26:49,3
who own private jets.

695
00:26:49,052 --> 00:26:50,6
Sometimes they would travel
as a group.

696
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:52,2
So if Tim stayed
in a hotel there,

697
00:26:52,048 --> 00:26:53,6
maybe that's why
he had the key card.

698
00:26:53,082 --> 00:26:54,7
Third-world
technology.

699
00:26:54,094 --> 00:26:56,1
Maybe that's why

700
00:26:56,036 --> 00:26:57,9
we couldn't read
the magnetic strip.

701
00:26:58,015 --> 00:27:00,1
We do charity work
in Port-au-Prince.

702
00:27:00,037 --> 00:27:02,6
We raised money to buy land
to build a school.

703
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:04,7
Maybe that's what the text
of the barren field was.

704
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,2
That photo was from
a few days ago.

705
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:08,6
The school would be
almost finished by now.

706
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:12,1
Unless it was never built.

707
00:27:13,059 --> 00:27:15,8
Unless the money
the foundation raised

708
00:27:15,096 --> 00:27:18,1
went somewhere else.

709
00:27:20,034 --> 00:27:22,1
Or to someone else.

710
00:27:36,015 --> 00:27:38,3
(snorts)
Really?

711
00:27:38,053 --> 00:27:40,6
That's your move?

712
00:27:40,082 --> 00:27:42,9
You were planning to seduce me?

713
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,9
That is...
truly desperate.

714
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,6
I'm not here
to seduce you, Will.

715
00:27:48,004 --> 00:27:49,3
But I do know what you desire.

716
00:27:51,033 --> 00:27:52,5
What is it you think I desire,

717
00:27:52,067 --> 00:27:54,1
Detective?

718
00:27:54,034 --> 00:27:55,3
To do good.

719
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:57,1
To help people.

720
00:27:57,038 --> 00:27:59,1
I did some research
into you, Will,

721
00:27:59,034 --> 00:28:00,6
and apparently, you don't charge

722
00:28:00,088 --> 00:28:02,8
for your services
here at the foundation.

723
00:28:03,005 --> 00:28:04,0
I make a nice living,

724
00:28:04,022 --> 00:28:05,5
thanks to my corporate work.

725
00:28:05,076 --> 00:28:07,4
Yeah, you protect your clients
like a bulldog,

726
00:28:07,064 --> 00:28:09,3
but underneath it all,
you're a big softie, aren't you?

727
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:12,6
I don't need to take money
away from those kids.

728
00:28:12,085 --> 00:28:14,4
No.

729
00:28:14,061 --> 00:28:15,8
But Vanessa does.

730
00:28:16,002 --> 00:28:16,7
What the hell does that mean?

731
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:18,0
I looked into a school

732
00:28:18,028 --> 00:28:19,7
that was supposed to be built

733
00:28:19,099 --> 00:28:21,0
with the foundation's money
in Port-au-Prince.

734
00:28:21,024 --> 00:28:23,0
(sighs)

735
00:28:23,024 --> 00:28:24,7
It doesn't exist.

736
00:28:25,091 --> 00:28:27,3
What?

737
00:28:27,058 --> 00:28:29,0
I think the money
went elsewhere.

738
00:28:29,029 --> 00:28:31,2
After all, Vanessa had
a hell of an expensive lifestyle

739
00:28:31,046 --> 00:28:33,3
to keep up after her husband
left the NBA.

740
00:28:33,054 --> 00:28:35,1
That is ridiculous.

741
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:38,0
Besides, non-profit financials
are a matter of public record.

742
00:28:38,025 --> 00:28:39,8
They are.

743
00:28:40,001 --> 00:28:41,4
But they're so complicated,
it would be pretty easy

744
00:28:41,068 --> 00:28:43,8
to hide a few
outgoing wire transfers.

745
00:28:44,005 --> 00:28:46,0
Here. I think Tim Dunlear

746
00:28:46,022 --> 00:28:47,7
looked into these financials
and figured it out.

747
00:28:47,093 --> 00:28:50,0
So he flew to Pout Au Prince
to see for himself,

748
00:28:50,023 --> 00:28:51,1
and when he realized

749
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,6
where the money went,

750
00:28:52,089 --> 00:28:54,4
he confronted Vanessa

751
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,9
and she killed him.

752
00:28:57,007 --> 00:28:58,7
That is pure speculation.

753
00:28:58,094 --> 00:28:59,7
It is.

754
00:28:59,094 --> 00:29:01,3
So help me get proof.

755
00:29:01,057 --> 00:29:03,5
If Vanessa transferred
money to herself,

756
00:29:03,078 --> 00:29:05,4
it'll show up in her
personal financial records,

757
00:29:05,062 --> 00:29:07,2
which you have access to.

758
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:09,0
You want me to violate
my client's trust

759
00:29:09,024 --> 00:29:10,5
based on a hunch?

760
00:29:10,075 --> 00:29:12,5
You took this job
to make a difference.

761
00:29:12,075 --> 00:29:14,9
This foundation
can still do good

762
00:29:15,017 --> 00:29:16,7
the way Tim
wanted it to.

763
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,2
If you help me.

have we met?

Briefly.

782
00:30:26,082 --> 00:30:28,2
Detective
Malcolm Graham.

783
00:30:28,045 --> 00:30:30,0
Ah, yes, of course!

784
00:30:30,024 --> 00:30:31,2
The infamous Malcolm.

785
00:30:31,041 --> 00:30:32,2
(chuckles)

786
00:30:32,045 --> 00:30:33,7
Tough times?

787
00:30:33,091 --> 00:30:34,9
You here to steal my watch?

788
00:30:35,012 --> 00:30:36,4
Well, there's no need.

789
00:30:36,062 --> 00:30:38,9
You've caught me
in a charitable mood.

790
00:30:39,013 --> 00:30:40,3
You could also use
a decent suit.

791
00:30:40,059 --> 00:30:41,3
The closet's that way.

792
00:30:41,059 --> 00:30:42,6
Thanks.

793
00:30:42,084 --> 00:30:44,0
I'm still going to kill you.

794
00:30:44,026 --> 00:30:45,8
Ah...

795
00:30:46,001 --> 00:30:47,8
I should also mention that
if you pull that trigger,

796
00:30:48,001 --> 00:30:50,0
it's a one-way ticket
to eternal damnation.

797
00:30:50,026 --> 00:30:51,1
Hell?

798
00:30:52,026 --> 00:30:54,2
Oh, I'm not going to Hell.

799
00:30:54,043 --> 00:30:55,2
Now or ever again.

800
00:30:55,048 --> 00:30:56,6
No?

801
00:30:56,081 --> 00:30:58,8
See, I made a deal
with an angel.

802
00:30:59,006 --> 00:31:01,4
And I've got orders
to take you out.

803
00:31:01,061 --> 00:31:03,4
Your ass for mine.

804
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:04,9
(laughs)

805
00:31:06,057 --> 00:31:08,2
Sorry, it's...

806
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:11,0
My holier-than-thou brother
has hired someone to kill me?

807
00:31:11,028 --> 00:31:13,1
Well, this really is
Opposite Day, isn't it?

808
00:31:15,033 --> 00:31:16,2
You know what, Malcolm?

809
00:31:18,008 --> 00:31:20,3
It's nighttime now.

810
00:31:20,058 --> 00:31:23,5
It's funny how things seem
so much clearer in the dark.

811
00:31:28,017 --> 00:31:29,2
Is that all you got?

812
00:31:31,026 --> 00:31:32,7
Interesting.

813
00:31:32,097 --> 00:31:35,7
Most people wet themselves
when they see my nastier side.

814
00:31:35,097 --> 00:31:37,4
Huh.

815
00:31:37,064 --> 00:31:38,9
Well, most people haven't
been to Hell and back.

816
00:31:40,077 --> 00:31:42,4
Rumor says

817
00:31:42,061 --> 00:31:43,9
you're not
immortal anymore.

818
00:31:44,011 --> 00:31:46,2
That if I pull
this trigger,

819
00:31:46,048 --> 00:31:47,9
it's bye-bye, Devil.

820
00:31:48,011 --> 00:31:49,2
Of course.

821
00:31:49,049 --> 00:31:51,1
Right. And what do you
get in return,

822
00:31:51,032 --> 00:31:52,4
Malcolm?

823
00:31:52,062 --> 00:31:54,0
Your brother
doesn't kill me.

824
00:31:54,024 --> 00:31:57,0
I stay out of Hell,
live out my life.

825
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,4
I love life.

826
00:31:58,066 --> 00:32:00,6
(chuckling)

827
00:32:00,087 --> 00:32:03,2
(both chuckling)

828
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:05,1
You've been duped, Malcolm.

829
00:32:05,034 --> 00:32:06,4
Huh?

830
00:32:06,063 --> 00:32:07,9
Angels can't take a mortal life.

831
00:32:08,013 --> 00:32:09,1
It's Dad's rules.

832
00:32:09,034 --> 00:32:11,0
Sorry. (laughs)

833
00:32:11,022 --> 00:32:14,4
And even if you do kill me...

834
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,2
what happens when you do die?

835
00:32:16,047 --> 00:32:19,3
Because you will...
eventually.

836
00:32:19,056 --> 00:32:21,1
You'll still go
back to Hell, Malcolm.

837
00:32:21,027 --> 00:32:22,6
There's nothing

838
00:32:22,081 --> 00:32:24,9
that my brother can
do to prevent that.

839
00:32:28,099 --> 00:32:29,9
What's that?

840
00:32:30,019 --> 00:32:31,5
This?

841
00:32:31,078 --> 00:32:33,9
This is my Pentecostal coin.

842
00:32:34,012 --> 00:32:38,2
It's a subway token for
the damned, if you will.

843
00:32:38,045 --> 00:32:42,2
I was going to use it to get
back to Hell eventually.

844
00:32:42,046 --> 00:32:45,7
I suppose you could use it
to get out of Hell, too.

845
00:32:47,034 --> 00:32:49,1
Could come in handy
for someone like you,

846
00:32:49,038 --> 00:32:50,5
don't you think, Malcolm?

847
00:32:54,068 --> 00:32:57,2
It's all yours
if you don't shoot me.

848
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,6
One-time offer.

849
00:33:09,098 --> 00:33:12,0

Are you okay?

868
00:34:15,076 --> 00:34:18,2
Yes, yes, I just needed
a little pick-me-up.

869
00:34:18,043 --> 00:34:19,7
It's been an exhausting day.

870
00:34:19,093 --> 00:34:22,7
Facing one's mortality
will do that.

871
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:25,4
I think we'll all deserve
a vacation after tonight,

a chance to mourn
Tim properly.

873
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,4
I fly out tomorrow.

874
00:34:29,065 --> 00:34:32,3
One of those Swiss med spas
that masquerades as a resort?

875
00:34:32,057 --> 00:34:33,8
(chuckles)
No.

876
00:34:34,007 --> 00:34:36,3
No, I own a small ranch
outside of Buenos Aires.

877
00:34:36,057 --> 00:34:38,2
Lovely.

878
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:40,2
I knew some folks who moved
to Buenos Aires back in the day.

879
00:34:40,041 --> 00:34:41,7
Oh. Good people?

880
00:34:41,095 --> 00:34:45,2
Nazis. No extradition treaty
in Argentina.

881
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:48,8
Just a nasty bunch of miscreants
hiding in plain sight.

882
00:34:49,008 --> 00:34:50,2
Gosh, they got away with murder.

883
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:58,7
You did kill your husband,
didn't you?

884
00:34:58,097 --> 00:35:00,8
No, that's absurd.

885
00:35:01,001 --> 00:35:02,4
I have to admit,
I'm not entirely sure why,

886
00:35:02,068 --> 00:35:03,8
but Detective Decker
will figure it out.

887
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:04,8
She always does.

888
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:06,2
I loved him.

889
00:35:06,043 --> 00:35:08,0
And Tim loved me.

890
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:09,6
Well, no, technically,
he loved your assistant, Kyle.

891
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:13,1
(sighs) Yes, but I...
I would never...

892
00:35:14,073 --> 00:35:15,5
Tim was a good man.

893
00:35:15,078 --> 00:35:16,9
He was selfless...

894
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,9
Yes.

895
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,8
Yes, he was.

896
00:35:21,003 --> 00:35:23,4
Everybody loved Tim, and he
asked for nothing in return,

897
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:26,1
not even his own happiness.

898
00:35:26,033 --> 00:35:29,4
Well, as the old saying goes,
you can't keep a good man down,

899
00:35:29,067 --> 00:35:31,1
not even in death.

900
00:35:31,033 --> 00:35:34,8
So how about we go downstairs,

901
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,3
see this night through,
and then...

902
00:35:38,051 --> 00:35:40,0
Oh, bloody hell.

903
00:35:40,022 --> 00:35:40,9

You're alive.

911
00:36:13,017 --> 00:36:15,6
Yes.

912
00:36:15,088 --> 00:36:17,6
Yes, it would appear
that way, wouldn't it?

913
00:36:17,088 --> 00:36:21,0
What are you doing here?

914
00:36:21,022 --> 00:36:23,8
I came to stop Malcolm;
he's planning to shoot you.

915
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:25,2
Malcolm?

916
00:36:25,043 --> 00:36:27,2
No, no, this wasn't him.

917
00:36:27,043 --> 00:36:29,1
He's taken care of.

918
00:36:29,031 --> 00:36:31,3
He is?

919
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:33,2
How?

920
00:36:33,048 --> 00:36:35,6
Well, I made him an offer
that he couldn't...

921
00:36:35,082 --> 00:36:37,6
You know the line.

922
00:36:37,082 --> 00:36:39,6
You look terrible, by the way.

923
00:36:39,082 --> 00:36:40,9
Rough day at the office?

924
00:36:41,011 --> 00:36:42,7
Uh, yeah.

925
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:44,7
Yeah, you could say that.

926
00:36:44,095 --> 00:36:47,4
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I've got a charity to attend

927
00:36:47,066 --> 00:36:49,2
and a killer to punish.

928
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:50,5
(elevator bell dings)

929
00:36:50,075 --> 00:36:51,5
How do I look?

930
00:36:53,029 --> 00:36:54,7
Pretty good, actually.

931
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,1
Yes, I thought as much.

932
00:36:57,034 --> 00:37:01,1
Oh, have a drink.

933
00:37:01,034 --> 00:37:02,8
Two, if you like.

934
00:37:03,001 --> 00:37:05,1
Who says the Devil
can't be charitable?

935
00:37:07,005 --> 00:37:10,3
VANESSA: Thank you all
so much for your generosity.

936
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:13,7
I would also like to thank
our host, Mr. Morningstar.

937
00:37:13,094 --> 00:37:17,0
He was going to say a few words,
but unfortunately he's been...

938
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:19,1
Right on time.

939
00:37:19,032 --> 00:37:21,7
How are we all
this evening, eh?

940
00:37:21,094 --> 00:37:23,4
Such a well-preserved crowd.

941
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:25,4
Love your work,
Dr. Broffman.

942
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:27,3
Tucking marvelous.
(chuckles)

943
00:37:27,053 --> 00:37:31,6
Right, we're all here to honor
Tim Dunlear's legacy,

944
00:37:31,087 --> 00:37:35,5
and what better way to do that
than to reveal his killer?

945
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:37,0
(crowd gasping)

946
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:39,5
Wouldn't you agree,
Mrs. Dunlear?

947
00:37:39,071 --> 00:37:42,5
Time to show your friends
your true colors.

948
00:37:42,072 --> 00:37:45,3
Tell them all your
nasty desires.

949
00:37:47,018 --> 00:37:49,0
CHLOE:
No need.

950
00:37:49,022 --> 00:37:51,0
We already have everything,

951
00:37:51,022 --> 00:37:53,8
how she embezzled money
from the foundation,

952
00:37:54,002 --> 00:37:56,5
and when Tim found out about it,
you killed him.

953
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:57,6
(crowd gasping)
Ah, see?

954
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:58,8
Told you she'd
figure it out.

955
00:37:59,007 --> 00:38:00,8
(scoffs)
You have no proof.

956
00:38:01,003 --> 00:38:02,3
Actually, we do.

957
00:38:02,053 --> 00:38:03,8
CHLOE: We have proof
of the embezzlement,

958
00:38:04,003 --> 00:38:05,4
and that's enough
for probable cause.

959
00:38:05,066 --> 00:38:07,8
Vanessa...

960
00:38:09,033 --> 00:38:11,8
I earned that money.

961
00:38:12,004 --> 00:38:14,5
I supported him
when he left pro ball.

962
00:38:14,071 --> 00:38:16,3
I let him sleep
with my assistant.

963
00:38:16,058 --> 00:38:18,0
- Oh.
- That money should
go to me,

964
00:38:18,025 --> 00:38:19,7
not those kids.

965
00:38:19,092 --> 00:38:21,3
Tim was going
to ruin everything.

966
00:38:21,055 --> 00:38:23,6
I had to.

967
00:38:23,088 --> 00:38:26,6
Now, doesn't that feel better?

968
00:38:26,084 --> 00:38:28,2
Huh?
(chuckles)

969
00:38:28,043 --> 00:38:29,6
Vanessa Dunlear,
you're under arrest

970
00:38:29,085 --> 00:38:31,0
for the murder
of Tim Dunlear.

971
00:38:33,089 --> 00:38:35,3
(whispering):
Thank you.

972
00:38:35,056 --> 00:38:37,0
You're welcome.

Kyle saying that someone gave

money to Emmett Toussaint's
scholarship fund,

1030
00:41:27,061 --> 00:41:29,7
enough for a full ride.

- I want...

1036
00:41:39,012 --> 00:41:39,9
- Oh.
- Sorry.

1037
00:41:40,012 --> 00:41:41,3
No, you.

1038
00:41:44,037 --> 00:41:48,5
Um, I've been thinking a lot
about the other night,

1039
00:41:48,075 --> 00:41:52,5
why I showed up drunk
to your place,

1040
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:57,0
why you wouldn't sleep with me,

1041
00:41:57,022 --> 00:41:59,6
and I think us,

1042
00:41:59,089 --> 00:42:02,6
our thing,

1043
00:42:02,089 --> 00:42:06,0
maybe it goes beyond just work.

1044
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:08,3
- Or sex.
- What sex?

1045
00:42:08,052 --> 00:42:11,5
Congratulations, the first woman
to give the Devil blue balls.

1046
00:42:11,073 --> 00:42:14,2
Anyhow,

1047
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:17,5
I, uh, I just...

1048
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:24,7
...I can let my guard
down with you.

1049
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,9
I don't do that
with anyone else.

1050
00:42:27,012 --> 00:42:29,9
You make me vulnerable.

1051
00:42:30,013 --> 00:42:34,0
And... maybe that's okay.

1052
00:42:37,043 --> 00:42:39,6
Detective...

1053
00:42:42,031 --> 00:42:46,1
...if it's any consolation
to your pride...

1054
00:42:46,031 --> 00:42:49,8
it appears you make me
vulnerable, too.
