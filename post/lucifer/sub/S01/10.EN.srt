00:00:02,096 --> 00:00:05,6
- So how do you afford
this place?
- It's my mother's.

LUCIFER:
Your mother's Penelope Decker,

00:00:07,055 --> 00:00:09,5
queen of '80s
cheeseball sci-fi?

5
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:11,3
You have to introduce me.

6
00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:13,0
So you're the doctor.

00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:16,9
I like you.

CHLOE: Are we gonna talk
about what happened?

10
00:00:19,018 --> 00:00:19,9
Our kiss.

11
00:00:20,018 --> 00:00:21,2
It's kind of a big deal.

go into evidence

Are we done?

17
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,1
Not by a long shot.

Who do you want me to kill?

Yes, of course.
Why not?

it's just about the outside.

just like us.

Sneaky little devils,

It's never the ones you expect.

Well, this is an
interesting one.

47
00:01:52,053 --> 00:01:54,3
Our victim's
a 60-year-old male.

48
00:01:54,053 --> 00:01:56,3
Collapsed
in broad daylight.

49
00:01:56,053 --> 00:01:58,6
No obvious injuries,
no sign of struggle.

50
00:01:58,087 --> 00:02:00,9
And the interesting part is?
(clears throat)

51
00:02:01,012 --> 00:02:02,0
This.

52
00:02:04,012 --> 00:02:05,6
Based on the bloodshot eyes
and the closed throat,

53
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,6
looks like this guy
was poisoned.

54
00:02:07,087 --> 00:02:09,5
No, no, no, no, no,
this is horrific.

55
00:02:09,079 --> 00:02:11,4
Dead bodies don't
usually affect you.

56
00:02:11,063 --> 00:02:13,8
You know who this is?
This is Chef Javier.

57
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:15,1
Javier Arias, yeah.

58
00:02:15,038 --> 00:02:17,6
Owner of Sol De Javier.
Did you know him?

59
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,1
Well, only by his work.
I mean, this chap was, uh...

60
00:02:19,034 --> 00:02:20,9
an artist in the kitchen.

61
00:02:21,014 --> 00:02:23,9
He made the most exquisite
Mexican cuisine I've ever had.

62
00:02:24,014 --> 00:02:24,9
And now...

63
00:02:25,014 --> 00:02:26,0
(sighs)

64
00:02:26,027 --> 00:02:27,5
It's okay.

65
00:02:27,073 --> 00:02:29,6
I'll never taste
his perfect tamales again.

66
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,5
So this isn't about the man,
this is about your stomach.

67
00:02:31,077 --> 00:02:34,2
This is about a crime
against good taste, Detective.

68
00:02:34,044 --> 00:02:36,1
Well, someone definitely needs
to be punished for this.

69
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,0
According to the grocers,
he came here every morning

70
00:02:38,028 --> 00:02:40,2
after having breakfast
at his restaurant.

71
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:41,9
M.E. says that
the poisoning happened

72
00:02:42,016 --> 00:02:43,4
about 90 minutes
before he fell,

73
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:45,2
which puts him squarely
at the restaurant.

74
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,8
Well, you can't think
his own staff poisoned him.

75
00:02:47,008 --> 00:02:48,9
I mean, the man was a visionary.

76
00:02:49,017 --> 00:02:50,8
With a hell of a temper,
by all accounts.

77
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,2
Everyone at the
restaurant's a suspect.

78
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,9
We need to interview
all of his employees

79
00:02:54,013 --> 00:02:55,4
and do a full sweep for toxins.

80
00:02:55,067 --> 00:02:58,9

he wrote down his recipes.

I wonder if police recovered any
leftovers from his last meal.

86
00:03:13,002 --> 00:03:14,2

likely poisoned.

Uh, no, that's what
we all called him.

94
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,7
We were like a family here.

95

Well, hold on, so everyone here
saw him as a father figure?

interesting now.

Well, my dear detective,

Sure.

It's 'cause I don't.

00:06:38,027 --> 00:06:40,0
Pops was like a father to me.

189
00:06:40,027 --> 00:06:41,6
He was such a nice man.

190
00:06:41,081 --> 00:06:43,2
Except when you
made a mistake.

191
00:06:43,048 --> 00:06:44,6
WOMAN 2:
That's right.

192
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:47,3
Then he got upset,
and he threw things.

193
00:06:47,053 --> 00:06:50,6
He threw things... a lot.

194
00:06:50,082 --> 00:06:52,6
- Where were you
this morning?
- Here.

195
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,4
I'm always here.

196
00:06:54,066 --> 00:06:55,7
Pops worked me to the bone.

197
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,4
A taskmaster, was he?

198
00:06:57,066 --> 00:06:59,9
No matter what you gave him,
it wasn't enough?

199
00:07:00,012 --> 00:07:01,5
It wasn't.

200
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:03,0
And I gave him a lot.

201
00:07:06,013 --> 00:07:09,1
Ah, to the bone, indeed.

202
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:10,9
Did you have
any altercations with Pops?

203
00:07:11,018 --> 00:07:12,9
- Sure.
- All the time.

204
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,3
Nothing I did was
ever good enough for Pops.

205
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,2
And it never would be, would it?

206
00:07:17,048 --> 00:07:19,8
Which is why he left you with
no choice but to take matters

207
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,6
into your own hands.

208
00:07:21,085 --> 00:07:23,1
He was like a father to me.

209
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,0
He was like a father to me...

210
00:07:25,023 --> 00:07:26,6
He was like a father to me.

211
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,9
And how was he to everyone else?

212
00:07:31,016 --> 00:07:34,2
Tough, but, ultimately,
he was fair.

213
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:36,1
Uh, he cared about his people.

214
00:07:36,033 --> 00:07:37,1
He was...

215
00:07:37,037 --> 00:07:38,3
"Like a father to you."

216
00:07:38,054 --> 00:07:39,9
Yes, we've heard
that one before.

217
00:07:40,016 --> 00:07:42,0
He was my father.

218
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,9
This is Javier's son, Junior.

219
00:07:45,017 --> 00:07:46,8
I don't work
here anymore.

220
00:07:47,005 --> 00:07:49,1
I-I've been away a while.

221
00:07:49,034 --> 00:07:51,5
I came over as soon
as I got the call.

222
00:07:51,072 --> 00:07:53,5
(chuckles)

223
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:55,6
I still can't believe
he's gone, man.

224
00:07:55,081 --> 00:07:57,6
Wayward son, are you?

225
00:07:57,089 --> 00:07:59,6
Yeah, you could say that.

226
00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:02,0
You and your father
had a strained relationship?

227
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:05,3
It's... it's complicated.

228
00:08:05,057 --> 00:08:08,0
You know, I feel like
the only thing

229
00:08:08,023 --> 00:08:10,0
that made him happy
was this place.

230
00:08:10,024 --> 00:08:13,2
So let me guess, you tried
to follow in his footsteps?

231
00:08:13,049 --> 00:08:14,8
Yeah, I trained as a chef, yeah.

232
00:08:15,007 --> 00:08:17,7
And Dad was domineering,
acted like a god in the kitchen?

233
00:08:17,091 --> 00:08:19,0
Lucifer.

234
00:08:19,025 --> 00:08:20,8
You have no idea.

235
00:08:21,008 --> 00:08:22,1
Oh, you'd be surprised.

236
00:08:22,029 --> 00:08:24,8
I was never gonna live up
to him, so I just, I...

237
00:08:25,008 --> 00:08:26,4
Rejected everything
he stood for.

238
00:08:26,067 --> 00:08:27,8
Yeah.

239
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,8
I gave up cooking,
I hit the road...

240
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:32,6
Which is why I'm curious
about your return.

241
00:08:32,084 --> 00:08:36,8
Was there something that you
wanted to do when you came back?

242
00:08:37,001 --> 00:08:39,4
Uh, I don't know, like...

243
00:08:39,064 --> 00:08:40,9
Oh, come now.

244
00:08:41,018 --> 00:08:43,7
The prodigal son returns
to his overbearing father.

245
00:08:43,098 --> 00:08:46,4
What could you possibly desire?

246
00:08:49,053 --> 00:08:50,4
I wanted...

247
00:08:50,065 --> 00:08:51,7
Yes?

248
00:08:53,028 --> 00:08:56,1
...to have one more meal
with my dad.

249
00:08:57,066 --> 00:08:58,8
(Chloe clears throat)

250
00:09:01,045 --> 00:09:03,6
(sighs) So you just got
into town last night?

251
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:06,0
Yeah, I-I met Dad here
for breakfast.

252
00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:08,5
Did you notice anything strange
about him or the meal?

253
00:09:08,071 --> 00:09:09,6
Anything?

254
00:09:09,084 --> 00:09:12,2
Dad had them bring
out our usual.

255
00:09:12,047 --> 00:09:14,6
(chuckles) We were actually
getting along for once.

256
00:09:14,084 --> 00:09:16,5
Uh, after we
finished eating,

257
00:09:16,072 --> 00:09:18,6
Dad left to do his pickup
at the market.

258
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,4
We were supposed to
meet up later tonight.

259
00:09:20,068 --> 00:09:22,2
Said he had something
he wanted to tell me, but...

260
00:09:22,048 --> 00:09:23,9
So now that Dad's gone,

261
00:09:24,014 --> 00:09:25,7
I'm guessing
the restaurant goes to you?

262
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:28,2
No, I don't...
I don't deserve this place.

263
00:09:29,057 --> 00:09:30,9
Dad knew that.

264
00:09:31,015 --> 00:09:32,6
(chuckles)

265
00:09:32,086 --> 00:09:33,8
Well, stay in town.

266
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:35,0
We may have more
questions for you.

267
00:09:37,087 --> 00:09:39,0
LUCIFER:
Well.

268
00:09:39,024 --> 00:09:40,9
Isn't that
a coincidence?

269
00:09:41,012 --> 00:09:42,3
Boy returns home,

270
00:09:42,058 --> 00:09:45,5
and, conveniently,
his pops drops the next day?

271
00:09:45,071 --> 00:09:47,7
(sighs)
Lucky bastard.

272
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,1
Maybe.

273
00:09:50,034 --> 00:09:52,0
Or maybe this is about
something more than anger,

274
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,6
which they all had,

275
00:09:53,088 --> 00:09:57,1
but if Junior isn't inheriting
the restaurant, then who is?

276
00:10:00,097 --> 00:10:02,8
LINDA: Well, I'm glad
you decided to come here,

277
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:06,8
but I'm not sure
this is appropriate.

278
00:10:07,002 --> 00:10:08,0
Why?

279
00:10:08,023 --> 00:10:11,4
Well, Lucifer's your boss
and a client of mine.

280
00:10:11,061 --> 00:10:13,6
I can recommend you
to someone else.

281
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:16,1
No, I like you.

282
00:10:16,036 --> 00:10:18,2
Look, you helped Lucifer,
and I need you to help me.

283
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:20,1
(sighs)

284
00:10:20,032 --> 00:10:21,8
What seems to be the problem?

285
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,8
(sighs)

286
00:10:25,004 --> 00:10:27,1
I'm stuck in a place
I don't belong,

287
00:10:27,037 --> 00:10:29,3
and I'm not going
anywhere anytime soon.

288
00:10:30,013 --> 00:10:31,6
I need to figure out

289
00:10:31,084 --> 00:10:32,7
how to be more...

290
00:10:34,084 --> 00:10:36,2
...normal.

291
00:10:36,042 --> 00:10:38,2
So...

292
00:10:38,043 --> 00:10:39,9
"So" what?

293
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,5
Tell me what to do.

294
00:10:42,076 --> 00:10:44,9
Well, that's not how this works.

295
00:10:46,077 --> 00:10:48,5
Do I need to sleep with you too?

296
00:10:48,077 --> 00:10:49,9
What?

297
00:10:50,015 --> 00:10:51,8
Is that it?

298
00:10:52,006 --> 00:10:53,0
Uh, no.

299
00:10:53,023 --> 00:10:54,0
No, I'm good.

300
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,0
I'm good.

301
00:10:55,028 --> 00:10:57,1
Really, I'm good.

302
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,7
What I can give you...

303
00:11:00,099 --> 00:11:04,2
is my advice.

304
00:11:04,049 --> 00:11:06,7
So... if we want to feel more
connected to our environment,

305
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,3
sometimes it's helpful

306
00:11:08,058 --> 00:11:12,1
if we actively embrace it
and those around you.

307
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,7
That still sounds like sex.

308
00:11:13,096 --> 00:11:17,2
Okay. I meant, uh, engage in

309
00:11:17,047 --> 00:11:20,7
caring and meaningful
relationships.

310
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:23,0
Making friends.

311
00:11:23,026 --> 00:11:24,2
Forget it.

312
00:11:24,043 --> 00:11:25,3
This was a mistake.

313
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,3
Mazikeen.

314
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,4
Wait. If you could...

315
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:31,5
What just happened?

316
00:11:31,077 --> 00:11:34,2
♪♪

317
00:11:35,065 --> 00:11:37,0
Something on
your mind, partner?

318
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:40,1
What's the gun for,
Malcolm?

319
00:11:40,036 --> 00:11:42,9
Oh, you mean that gun
you stole for me?

320
00:11:43,012 --> 00:11:44,5
That gun?

321
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,8
I was wondering when you'd ask.

322
00:11:46,004 --> 00:11:46,8
You know what?

323
00:11:47,008 --> 00:11:48,7
I'm done playing
your stupid games.

324
00:11:48,091 --> 00:11:50,5
You want to tell everyone
I shot you,

325
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,5
you go right ahead.

326
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,8
But I'm gonna put an end
to whatever you're planning.

327
00:11:55,004 --> 00:11:57,5
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, chill, Dan.

328
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,7
God, you went from
zero to 100 so fast.

329
00:12:00,093 --> 00:12:02,0
The way I see it,

330
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:03,6
I'm doing you a favor.

331
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:04,9
(chuckles) A favor?

332
00:12:05,018 --> 00:12:07,5
Another man spends
so much time with my wife,

333
00:12:07,077 --> 00:12:09,6
I sure wouldn't like it.

334
00:12:09,081 --> 00:12:12,1
Especially knowing
this guy's so dangerous.

335
00:12:13,094 --> 00:12:15,5
You want to kill Lucifer?

336
00:12:15,077 --> 00:12:17,4
Why?

337
00:12:17,061 --> 00:12:19,0
If I told you,

338
00:12:19,028 --> 00:12:20,6
I promise,

339
00:12:20,082 --> 00:12:22,1
you wouldn't believe me.

340
00:12:23,061 --> 00:12:25,2
But before you go

341
00:12:25,049 --> 00:12:28,2
growing any more balls,
remember this...

342
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:29,7
(sighs)

343
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,0
You thinking about
taking another shot at me,

344
00:12:31,025 --> 00:12:33,0
try to take me down?

345
00:12:35,008 --> 00:12:37,1
Don't miss.

346
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,9
So you're Anne Martin,
the sous chef.

347
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:44,0
You're Javier's
number two?

348
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,3
ANNE:
I mean, I guess I was.

349
00:12:45,051 --> 00:12:48,1
I mean, I-I can't believe it.

350
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:50,8
I... I just saw Pops
this morning, he was fine.

351
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:54,0
- And you cooked his last
meal, is that right?
- So?

352
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,5
You know how many people had
their hands on that plate?

353
00:12:56,073 --> 00:12:58,2
Well, this is
your kitchen, Anne.

354
00:12:58,044 --> 00:12:59,7
When Pops isn't here,
you run the show.

355
00:12:59,098 --> 00:13:01,2
And from what I understand,

356
00:13:01,044 --> 00:13:03,0
you're not someone
to be messed with, so...

357
00:13:03,024 --> 00:13:05,2
you really think someone's
gonna go behind your back?

358
00:13:05,045 --> 00:13:06,7
I can't control what they do.

359
00:13:06,095 --> 00:13:08,2
Who knows what kind
of psychos we have?

360
00:13:08,049 --> 00:13:09,7
Well, are any of these psychos

361
00:13:09,099 --> 00:13:11,0
set to inherit the restaurant,
like you are?

362
00:13:12,037 --> 00:13:13,9
I spoke to his estate attorney.

363
00:13:14,017 --> 00:13:16,7
It's no secret Javier
was grooming me to take over.

364
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:18,4
He was my mentor.

365
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:20,1
Well, of all the reasons
to kill your father figure,

366
00:13:20,038 --> 00:13:21,8
greed is truly the ugliest.

367
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:24,3
You think I killed Pops
to speed up my inheritance?

368
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:26,5
I would never do
anything to hurt him.

369
00:13:26,076 --> 00:13:27,9
He taught me everything.

370
00:13:28,014 --> 00:13:28,8
He meant the world to me.
(phone buzzing)

371
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,9
LUCIFER:
Well...

372
00:13:32,018 --> 00:13:33,6
If you didn't wish
your dear old "Pops" ill,

373
00:13:33,085 --> 00:13:36,1
what did you wish?

374
00:13:36,031 --> 00:13:38,5
To surpass him.

375
00:13:38,073 --> 00:13:39,9
Ah! So the student

376
00:13:40,015 --> 00:13:41,4
becomes the master, eh?

377
00:13:41,069 --> 00:13:43,0
What? No! It's not like that.

378
00:13:43,024 --> 00:13:44,5
CHLOE: Preliminary tox
screen came in.

379
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:46,7
The poison used to kill
Javier was mercury.

380
00:13:46,099 --> 00:13:48,1
Oh.

381
00:13:48,037 --> 00:13:49,3
So you cracked open
a few thermometers

382
00:13:49,053 --> 00:13:50,9
over brunch, did you?

383
00:13:51,012 --> 00:13:52,7
Not the trick I'd use,
but clearly effective.

384
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,9
There was something else
in his system, too.

385
00:13:55,016 --> 00:13:56,2
Can I see the inside
of your arms?

386
00:13:56,042 --> 00:13:57,2
Why?

387
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,3
Track marks.

388
00:13:58,058 --> 00:14:00,1
Ah, so there was heroin as well?

389
00:14:00,034 --> 00:14:01,8
Generous killer, aren't you?

390
00:14:02,005 --> 00:14:03,8
Wanted to give him
a little high on the way out?

391
00:14:04,001 --> 00:14:05,3
This is crazy. No.
If you...

392
00:14:05,059 --> 00:14:07,6
if it's heroin,
you should talk to...

393
00:14:07,084 --> 00:14:09,3
I'm sorry.

394
00:14:09,051 --> 00:14:10,8
Don't worry.

395
00:14:11,006 --> 00:14:12,5
I tend to have a rather
striking effect on women.

396
00:14:12,072 --> 00:14:13,6
Come on.

397
00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:15,1
Just let it all out.

398
00:14:15,077 --> 00:14:16,8
Oh!

399
00:14:17,002 --> 00:14:19,6
Okay.

400
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,2
Someone call an ambulance!

401
00:14:21,044 --> 00:14:23,0
Well, I've never had
that effect.

402
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:35,0
Do you still think
she's a suspect?

403
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,6
We can arrest her now,
if you'd like.

404
00:14:36,087 --> 00:14:38,9
You know, once she's done
getting her stomach pumped.

405
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:40,7
What I want to know is...

406
00:14:40,096 --> 00:14:43,3
did she ingest the same thing
as Javier by mistake?

407
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,7
Or was she poisoned, too?

408
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:47,3
Why did she survive?

409
00:14:47,051 --> 00:14:49,7
Well, perhaps the killer simply
ran out of thermometers.

410
00:14:49,093 --> 00:14:51,2
Who would have a bone to pick

411
00:14:51,043 --> 00:14:52,5
with Javier and his number two?

412
00:14:52,076 --> 00:14:54,1
Oh, I don't know.

413
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:55,5
Perhaps someone who was
kicked out of the family biz?

414
00:14:55,077 --> 00:14:57,2
You mean Junior.

415
00:14:57,048 --> 00:14:58,9
Well, he seemed like a very
troubled young man to me.

416
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:00,4
Yeah.

417
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,1
It's almost as if
his dad just died.

418
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:05,7
Oh, and look who decided
to grace us with his douchedom.

419
00:15:05,094 --> 00:15:06,9
Daniel...

420
00:15:07,015 --> 00:15:09,0
Hey. Did you
find something?

421
00:15:09,024 --> 00:15:10,8
A Naomi Austen.

422
00:15:11,007 --> 00:15:13,2
She worked as a hostess here
last year till she was fired.

423
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:14,7
She has two arrests
for heroin possession

424
00:15:14,099 --> 00:15:16,3
over the last
year alone.

425
00:15:16,054 --> 00:15:18,7
Poor girl doesn't learn
her lesson, does she?

426
00:15:18,091 --> 00:15:19,7
Naomi Austen.

427
00:15:19,096 --> 00:15:20,9
That name sounds familiar.

428
00:15:21,017 --> 00:15:22,9
Oh, okay.

429
00:15:23,013 --> 00:15:25,0
So one of the cooks said that
she showed up two days ago,

430
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:26,9
and was yelling
at Javier and Anne, so...

431
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:28,9
I'll see if her P.O.
has an address.

432
00:15:29,017 --> 00:15:30,6
It's already in the file.

433
00:15:30,084 --> 00:15:32,3
Look at you two,
like Cagney and Lacey.

434
00:15:32,055 --> 00:15:34,8
You don't care
who you piss off, do you?

435
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,0
Not in the slightest, no.

436
00:15:36,027 --> 00:15:37,6
(under breath):
Oh, my God.

437
00:15:37,085 --> 00:15:38,6
Oh, wait!

438
00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:40,3
Um, Dan. Um...

439
00:15:42,056 --> 00:15:44,1
So, uh, if you don't
have plans tonight,

440
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,3
my mom is having
this family dinner...

441
00:15:47,057 --> 00:15:49,4
And you could really
use a buffer.

442
00:15:49,061 --> 00:15:50,9
Yeah.

443
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:52,8
Sure. Send me the details.

444
00:15:53,007 --> 00:15:54,0
All right.

445
00:15:54,028 --> 00:15:55,7
LUCIFER:
Detective...

446
00:15:55,095 --> 00:15:57,7
do you mind if we make
a stop on the way?

447
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,8
I mean, this shirt's
more of a loaner, really.

448
00:16:01,054 --> 00:16:03,4
(buzzing)

449
00:16:07,046 --> 00:16:08,9
(Chloe sighs)

450
00:16:10,026 --> 00:16:11,8
Still no answer.

451
00:16:15,001 --> 00:16:17,7
OJ... spoons, foil.

452
00:16:17,097 --> 00:16:19,0
Looks like a junkie...

453
00:16:25,006 --> 00:16:26,4
What do you think you're doing?

454
00:16:26,065 --> 00:16:28,4
Well, I found something
far more interesting.

455
00:16:28,061 --> 00:16:29,8
We don't have a warrant.

456
00:16:30,003 --> 00:16:31,2
We don't have time
for warrants, Detective!

457
00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:33,6
Look. Junior was here.

458
00:16:33,082 --> 00:16:34,5
Junior was staying here?

459
00:16:35,087 --> 00:16:37,4
He and Naomi must be close.

460
00:16:37,066 --> 00:16:38,8
Yeah, well, they probably
chased the dragon together

461
00:16:39,008 --> 00:16:40,3
after Junior killed his dad

462
00:16:40,058 --> 00:16:42,5
and then sat and looked
at the twinkly lights.

463
00:16:42,075 --> 00:16:44,2
Why have they still got
their Christmas tree up?

464
00:16:44,042 --> 00:16:45,8
We don't know what happened.

465
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:47,4
Well, maybe something in here
will help clear that up.

466
00:16:47,067 --> 00:16:50,0
Right. Uh...

467
00:16:51,042 --> 00:16:53,6
Board shorts.

468
00:16:53,088 --> 00:16:55,7
Don't know what more proof
you need that he's deranged.

469
00:16:55,093 --> 00:16:57,6
We're not supposed
to be in here.

470
00:16:57,081 --> 00:16:58,9
Oh, come on.

471
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,6
(sighs)

472
00:17:00,081 --> 00:17:02,9
So let's just
search the place fast.

473
00:17:03,014 --> 00:17:04,5
Oh! Well, well.

474
00:17:04,077 --> 00:17:06,3
Lead the way, Detective.

475
00:17:06,052 --> 00:17:07,8
All right.

476
00:17:09,065 --> 00:17:12,5
(couple moaning in pleasure,
bed springs squeaking)

477
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:13,7
Oh... I... can...

478
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:15,2
can you hear that?

479
00:17:15,045 --> 00:17:17,6
Yeah. And since when
has that bothered you?

480
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,0
WOMAN:
Oh, God!

481
00:17:19,028 --> 00:17:20,5
And dear old Dad strikes again.

482
00:17:20,074 --> 00:17:22,6
- I mean...
- (giggles)

483
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,2
- It's not funny.
- It's kind of funny.

484
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:25,7
Well, that's easy
for you to say.

485
00:17:25,092 --> 00:17:27,1
You're not the one
being taunted, are you?

486
00:17:27,033 --> 00:17:29,3
"Oh, God" this!
"Oh, God" that!

487
00:17:29,055 --> 00:17:32,0
He's popping up everywhere
and spoiling my favorite things!

488
00:17:32,021 --> 00:17:34,0
I'd really hate
to be in your head.

489
00:17:34,026 --> 00:17:35,5
Well, why would
you understand?

490
00:17:35,072 --> 00:17:37,3
Your mother's
absolutely delightful.

491
00:17:37,055 --> 00:17:39,0
Oh, of course you think she is.

492
00:17:39,022 --> 00:17:40,0
Oh...

493
00:17:40,022 --> 00:17:41,7
Do I detect some angst?

494
00:17:44,085 --> 00:17:46,5
She's like a child.

495
00:17:46,073 --> 00:17:48,2
- Oh, and I bet
it drove you crazy.
- Yeah.

496
00:17:48,044 --> 00:17:50,9
All she wanted was to doll me up
and take me to auditions.

497
00:17:51,019 --> 00:17:52,7
Would make anyone mad with rage.

498
00:17:52,099 --> 00:17:54,3
She made everything about her.

499
00:17:54,057 --> 00:17:57,0
So you could just murder her!

500
00:17:57,024 --> 00:17:58,0
Sure.

501
00:17:58,028 --> 00:17:59,7
But I didn't.

502
00:17:59,095 --> 00:18:01,6
And you're still not proving
your point about Junior.

503
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,2
(sighs)

504
00:18:03,045 --> 00:18:04,4
Fair enough.

505
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:06,6
So how did you handle it,
anyway?

506
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,3
You know, besides taking
your anger out on criminals?

507
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:09,7
I don't know.

508
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,8
I guess I just
always tried to

509
00:18:13,005 --> 00:18:16,0
focus on something else.

510
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,4
This is...

511
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:18,8
weird.

512
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,4
Well! That painting

513
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,3
just became far more valuable.

514
00:18:30,056 --> 00:18:31,4
(door opens)
Oh.

515
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:34,4
Hello, Naomi.

516
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:35,6
Who the hell are you?

517
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,7
Heroin inspector.

518
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,9
I'm afraid your spoons

519
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,7
aren't up to standard, so...

520
00:18:39,091 --> 00:18:41,1
Hold on.

521
00:18:41,033 --> 00:18:42,6
We have some
questions for you.

522
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,5
NAOMI:
You think I killed Javier?

523
00:18:46,071 --> 00:18:48,4
Well, I don't.
But she definitely does.

524
00:18:48,067 --> 00:18:50,0
But she thought it was
the sous chef before,

525
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,2
so don't take it personally.

526
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,5
(Chloe clears throat)

527
00:18:54,025 --> 00:18:56,6
The poison that killed Javier
was laced with heroin.

528
00:18:56,084 --> 00:18:58,6
We know you use and
we know that you had a fight

529
00:18:58,088 --> 00:19:01,4
with Javier and Anne Martin
two days ago.

530
00:19:01,064 --> 00:19:02,6
Okay, I admit,

531
00:19:02,085 --> 00:19:04,6
I went to see Pops
a few days ago,

532
00:19:04,085 --> 00:19:06,1
'cause Junior
called me to tell me

533
00:19:06,035 --> 00:19:08,0
he was coming back home.

534
00:19:08,027 --> 00:19:10,3
I just wanted
to make peace with his dad.

535
00:19:10,056 --> 00:19:11,7
Make peace? Why?

536
00:19:11,098 --> 00:19:13,8
Because he didn't
want us together.

537
00:19:14,002 --> 00:19:15,3
- So you're dating Junior.
- We were.

538
00:19:15,048 --> 00:19:17,5
A year ago,
before he left.

539
00:19:17,078 --> 00:19:21,5
And I thought, maybe,
when he came back...

540
00:19:21,074 --> 00:19:23,2
But Pops never approved.

541
00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:25,1
Well, I can't see
why they're not fans

542
00:19:25,037 --> 00:19:27,5
of your whole
Kurt and Courtney vibe.

543
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,6
I tried to tell him that Junior
got clean on his travels,

544
00:19:29,087 --> 00:19:31,7
but it didn't matter.

545
00:19:31,092 --> 00:19:33,7
Javier said
he would never support us.

546
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,1
I got upset.

547
00:19:35,034 --> 00:19:36,4
What happened
with you at breakfast?

548
00:19:36,067 --> 00:19:38,6
Nothing.

549
00:19:38,084 --> 00:19:40,1
I wasn't even at breakfast.

550
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:42,4
Junior wanted
to see his dad alone.

551
00:19:42,064 --> 00:19:43,9
I went to see my sponsor.

552
00:19:44,018 --> 00:19:45,7
I've been having
a tough time of it lately.

553
00:19:45,093 --> 00:19:47,3
All right.

554
00:19:47,056 --> 00:19:48,6
Until we can confirm that,

555
00:19:48,081 --> 00:19:50,0
we need you to come
down to the station.

556
00:19:50,027 --> 00:19:51,6
Why, pray tell,

557
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,7
did Junior want to see
his dad alone?

558
00:19:53,098 --> 00:19:55,7
He just said that he wanted
to make it right.

559
00:19:55,094 --> 00:19:57,4
That all he
needed to do

560
00:19:57,065 --> 00:20:00,0
was confront his father
and settle things.

561
00:20:00,028 --> 00:20:02,2
- (laughs)
- Hmm.

562
00:20:02,049 --> 00:20:03,8
You don't think that...

563
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:05,5
He killed him?

564
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:08,2
Junior told us he wanted to have
one more meal with his dad.

565
00:20:08,045 --> 00:20:09,5
It seems he did--

566
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:11,1
a rather final one.

567
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:14,4
Do you know
where he is?

568
00:20:14,063 --> 00:20:17,1
I haven't talked to him
since this morning.

569
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,2
CHLOE:
APB on Junior's out.

570
00:20:23,043 --> 00:20:24,8
We're trying to ping
his cell.

571
00:20:25,001 --> 00:20:26,7
I'm glad we're finally
on the same page.

572
00:20:26,097 --> 00:20:28,4
You know, ever since
we met this kid,

573
00:20:28,068 --> 00:20:30,0
you've had it
in for him. Why?

574
00:20:30,027 --> 00:20:32,6
Guess he's a bird of a feather.

575
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:35,4
Someone who had a shadow
cast over him his entire life.

576
00:20:35,069 --> 00:20:36,9
Whereas I could never
escape from under mine...

577
00:20:37,011 --> 00:20:38,5
he could.

578
00:20:38,078 --> 00:20:40,6
I wonder how that feels.

579
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:41,7
(phone rings)

580
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:43,4
Decker.

581
00:20:45,024 --> 00:20:46,7
No. No, you did
the right thing.

582
00:20:46,095 --> 00:20:48,8
- I'm on my way.
- Did they find Junior?

583
00:20:49,004 --> 00:20:51,0
- No. I gotta go.
- But we've a killer to catch!

584
00:20:51,021 --> 00:20:52,6
And we will.
This is an emergency.

585
00:20:54,029 --> 00:20:55,1
(knocking)
Detective!

586
00:20:55,033 --> 00:20:56,7
Come on!

587
00:20:56,096 --> 00:20:57,7
Oh...

588
00:20:57,096 --> 00:21:00,4
(tires squealing)

589
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:03,3
You've got to stop doing that!

590
00:21:05,047 --> 00:21:06,3
(sighs)

591
00:21:06,051 --> 00:21:07,7
Oh, no.

592
00:21:07,093 --> 00:21:10,3
Nana says we're gonna
be in a movie!

593
00:21:10,052 --> 00:21:11,6
(scoffs)

594
00:21:11,081 --> 00:21:13,3
PENELOPE:
No, no, no.

595
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:17,1
So the babysitter called

596
00:21:17,036 --> 00:21:19,3
and said that
you let her off early.

597
00:21:19,057 --> 00:21:20,8
Yeah, 'cause we didn't
need her anymore.

598
00:21:21,086 --> 00:21:22,9
We were just on our way

599
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,6
to our first audition.

600
00:21:24,086 --> 00:21:26,1
Ooh, isn't that a thrill?

601
00:21:26,032 --> 00:21:27,4
You didn't think
to ask me about that?

602
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:29,2
What do you mean,
"our" audition?

603
00:21:29,049 --> 00:21:30,9
I am up for a new role,

604
00:21:31,012 --> 00:21:32,2
and I thought it would be good

605
00:21:32,045 --> 00:21:33,7
to play off
of somebody.

606
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:34,9
Oh, okay.

607
00:21:35,017 --> 00:21:37,2
Can I talk to you
for a sec?

608
00:21:37,042 --> 00:21:38,6
So you thought
it'd be a good idea

609
00:21:38,084 --> 00:21:40,3
to use Trixie
as a prop?

610
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,6
A co-star.

611
00:21:41,084 --> 00:21:43,5
Everyone's gotta
start somewhere.

612
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,7
And isn't she the cutest little
lounge singer you've ever seen?

613
00:21:45,093 --> 00:21:47,5
She looks ridiculous.

614
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:49,8
How can you exploit your family
for your next acting job?

615
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,3
You know, for someone
who hated acting,

616
00:21:51,052 --> 00:21:52,9
you sure know
how to be dramatic.

617
00:21:53,014 --> 00:21:54,0
You can't do this.

618
00:21:54,023 --> 00:21:55,4
You can't push Trixie into this

619
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,9
the way that you pushed me.

620
00:21:57,019 --> 00:21:58,6
You can't walk in here--

621
00:21:58,081 --> 00:22:00,6
Like I own the place?

622
00:22:00,086 --> 00:22:01,8
The place
you're living in

623
00:22:02,007 --> 00:22:04,1
rent free?

624
00:22:04,036 --> 00:22:05,5
You asked me to stay here.

625
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:07,7
You have no right to take her--

626
00:22:09,045 --> 00:22:11,1
Where is she?

627
00:22:12,029 --> 00:22:13,1
She was just here.

628
00:22:13,037 --> 00:22:14,4
Trixie?

629
00:22:15,058 --> 00:22:16,5
Trix?

630
00:22:18,008 --> 00:22:20,1
Trixie?

631
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:21,6
Trixie!

632
00:22:23,017 --> 00:22:24,3
She's gone.

633
00:22:28,064 --> 00:22:31,0
I've called her friends,
I've called our neighbors.

634
00:22:31,022 --> 00:22:33,2
No one has heard from her. No.

635
00:22:34,035 --> 00:22:36,3
All right, I'll call you
if I hear anything.

636
00:22:36,056 --> 00:22:38,5
Dan hasn't heard from her.

637
00:22:38,073 --> 00:22:40,0
Take a breath, Chloe.

638
00:22:40,023 --> 00:22:41,6
She's a smart girl--
where would she go?

639
00:22:41,082 --> 00:22:43,0
I don't know.

640
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,1
She left and--
(phone chimes)

641
00:22:47,003 --> 00:22:47,9
What?

642
00:22:48,011 --> 00:22:49,4
What is it?

643
00:22:49,066 --> 00:22:53,0
She ordered a ride
from my Uber account.

644
00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:54,8

My mom and dad

used to a lot.

667
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:05,9
But this time it was Mom

00:24:06,015 --> 00:24:08,3
fighting with Nana
about how I look.

669
00:24:08,053 --> 00:24:12,2
Which one wants you to look

My grandma, I guess.

671
00:24:15,024 --> 00:24:18,3
They're fighting over what they
want me to be when I grow up.

What do you want to be?

673
00:24:20,016 --> 00:24:23,0
I want to be
the first president of Mars.

00:24:23,021 --> 00:24:24,8
Or a zookeeper.

675
00:24:25,004 --> 00:24:27,0
Mm-hmm.

676
00:24:27,021 --> 00:24:29,7
I used to be a zookeeper.

677
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:31,5

You know, to finally be free.

700
00:25:22,031 --> 00:25:24,2
I mean, you're about
to be arrested.

701
00:25:24,044 --> 00:25:26,7
But, uh, at least
you're free of him.

702
00:25:26,094 --> 00:25:27,6
What are you talking about?

703
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:29,0
Your father!

704
00:25:29,019 --> 00:25:30,8
You killed him.
Tell me all about it.

705
00:25:31,003 --> 00:25:32,9
I mean, is the air
a little sweeter?

706
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,2
Is the sun a little brighter?

707
00:25:35,045 --> 00:25:36,8
I didn't kill my dad, man.

708
00:25:37,003 --> 00:25:38,4
Oh, come on--
why return to dispose

709
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,1
of the murder weapon then?

710
00:25:40,037 --> 00:25:41,2
The heroin.

711
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:42,5
Sorry, it's all gone.

712
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:43,8
Police took it away for testing.

713
00:25:44,004 --> 00:25:45,9
Well, (chuckles) most of it.

714
00:25:46,017 --> 00:25:46,7
"Heroin"?

715
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,0
No, I

716
00:25:48,021 --> 00:25:49,2
came for this.

717
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:51,0
Ah-ah-ah-ah

718
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:53,9
Careful, Junior, you don't
who you're playing with.

719
00:25:54,013 --> 00:25:54,8
What?

720
00:25:55,009 --> 00:25:56,1
No.

721
00:25:56,034 --> 00:25:58,3
(sighs)

722
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:00,8
My dad gave me this knife.

723
00:26:01,006 --> 00:26:02,7
It's all I have left
from him.

724
00:26:04,098 --> 00:26:06,9
You're not relieved
he's gone at all.

725
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:08,8
Why would I be relieved?

726
00:26:09,002 --> 00:26:10,7
Because he was judgmental
and cruel,

727
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:12,6
and he tried to force you
into being someone you're not.

728
00:26:12,082 --> 00:26:14,3
And he's gone now.

729
00:26:14,053 --> 00:26:16,2
So you can finally
be your own man.

730
00:26:16,049 --> 00:26:18,0
Oh, dear.

731
00:26:18,024 --> 00:26:20,0
You didn't kill him, did you?

732
00:26:20,024 --> 00:26:22,0
Of course not.

733
00:26:22,024 --> 00:26:24,2
(sighs)

734
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:26,7
So, are you gonna
arrest me or what?

735
00:26:32,088 --> 00:26:34,4
Hi, Trixie!

736
00:26:34,067 --> 00:26:36,5
I'm so glad you're back.

737
00:26:36,076 --> 00:26:38,4
Listen, Nana needs
to explain something--

738
00:26:38,064 --> 00:26:40,5
Mom, let's just
have dinner, okay?
(knocks)

739
00:26:40,072 --> 00:26:42,4
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Dan!

740
00:26:42,068 --> 00:26:44,6
What a pleasant surprise.

741
00:26:44,089 --> 00:26:47,3
- And you brought dessert.
- Of course.

742
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,8
So thoughtful as always.

743
00:26:50,002 --> 00:26:51,2
So good to see you, Penny.

744
00:26:51,048 --> 00:26:52,6
Something smells amazing.

745
00:26:52,086 --> 00:26:54,1
- Mmm.
- Yeah, Mom.

746
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,9
Where'd you buy
this nice home-cooked meal?

747
00:26:56,011 --> 00:26:57,7
Oh, there's no take-out tonight.

748
00:26:57,095 --> 00:26:59,1
Lucifer

749
00:26:59,028 --> 00:27:00,8
has provided the meal.

750
00:27:01,007 --> 00:27:02,2
Wait.

751
00:27:02,045 --> 00:27:03,7
Lucifer's here?

752
00:27:03,091 --> 00:27:05,8
He and his friend
have been here a while.

753
00:27:06,004 --> 00:27:06,9
His friend?
LUCIFER:
Ah!

754
00:27:07,016 --> 00:27:09,2
Detective!
Just in time.

755
00:27:09,046 --> 00:27:10,8
Uh, you remember Junior?

756
00:27:11,008 --> 00:27:12,0
Of course.

757
00:27:12,025 --> 00:27:14,5
Just wait until
you taste his molé.

758
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,6
It is to die for.

759
00:27:21,085 --> 00:27:23,9
TRIXIE: Lucifer!
LUCIFER:
Oh, get back!

760
00:27:24,018 --> 00:27:26,2
Okay, monkey, surprise.

761
00:27:26,043 --> 00:27:27,9
You get to eat chocolate cake
in bed tonight.

762
00:27:28,014 --> 00:27:28,9
Why?

763
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:30,3
Does it matter?

764
00:27:30,052 --> 00:27:32,2
Nope.

765
00:27:32,048 --> 00:27:34,1
Junior, if you wouldn't mind.

766
00:27:34,032 --> 00:27:36,8
(clears throat)

767
00:27:37,003 --> 00:27:38,8
- Yes?
- So you brought

768
00:27:39,003 --> 00:27:41,8
a guy who's suspected
of murder by poisoning

769
00:27:42,003 --> 00:27:44,3
to cook for my family?

770
00:27:44,058 --> 00:27:45,7
Well, if you arrest him,

771
00:27:45,099 --> 00:27:47,0
he's just going
to lawyer up, isn't he?

772
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,0
So why not have a nice meal

773
00:27:49,025 --> 00:27:50,4
whilst you get
all the answers you need, hmm?

774
00:27:50,062 --> 00:27:51,8
I'm certain he'll open up.

775
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:53,3
Why is that?

776
00:27:53,054 --> 00:27:54,3
Because I convinced him
you'd hear him out.

777
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:55,7
After all, he's innocent.

778
00:27:55,096 --> 00:27:56,9
Oh, you think he's innocent now?

779
00:27:57,013 --> 00:27:58,4
Come on, Detective.

780
00:27:58,063 --> 00:28:00,0
If you're not satisfied
with his answers,

781
00:28:00,022 --> 00:28:01,2
you can always
arrest him afterwards.

782
00:28:01,047 --> 00:28:02,3
JUNIOR:
I stopped eating meat

783
00:28:02,059 --> 00:28:05,3
while backpacking
through India,

784
00:28:05,056 --> 00:28:08,7
so I had to get creative
with my dishes.

785
00:28:08,098 --> 00:28:11,5
This is my vegetarian take

786
00:28:11,077 --> 00:28:14,3
on Oaxacan molé with a tart,

787
00:28:14,056 --> 00:28:15,9
vegan crème fraîche.

788
00:28:16,011 --> 00:28:18,3
- Sounds so exotic.
- Lovely.

789
00:28:18,053 --> 00:28:19,6
I cannot wait to dig in.

790
00:28:19,082 --> 00:28:22,1
- Mom, don't eat that!
- Why not?

791
00:28:22,036 --> 00:28:23,4
She's worried
it might be poisoned.

792
00:28:23,062 --> 00:28:25,4
- You are?
- Oh, that's right.

793
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,5
Let's catch you up, shall we?
Um, I brought

794
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:28,8
Junior here tonight

795
00:28:29,004 --> 00:28:29,9
because Detective Decker
believes

796
00:28:30,012 --> 00:28:31,0
that he killed his father.

797
00:28:31,021 --> 00:28:32,8
- You do?
- What are you doing, man?

798
00:28:33,008 --> 00:28:34,8
But I believe he was after
something far more foolish.

799
00:28:35,009 --> 00:28:36,5
Reconciliation.

800
00:28:36,075 --> 00:28:37,6
JUNIOR:
That's right.

801
00:28:37,084 --> 00:28:38,9
I didn't kill my dad.

802
00:28:39,013 --> 00:28:39,9
Do you have proof?

803
00:28:41,051 --> 00:28:42,8
Just my word.

804
00:28:43,005 --> 00:28:44,4
Well, we might need
something more than that.

805
00:28:44,068 --> 00:28:46,3
Oh, come on, Detective,
you said yourself

806
00:28:46,051 --> 00:28:48,0
you may want to kill your
mother, but you don't do it.

807
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:50,0
Oh, so you want to kill me now?
Just because I put makeup

808
00:28:50,027 --> 00:28:53,2
- on your daughter?
- No, because she thinks thinks
you're a child and forced her

809
00:28:53,044 --> 00:28:55,1
to grow up too quickly.

810
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,6
Am I wrong?

811
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:59,1
You're way out line, man.

812
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,7
There he goes leaping
to her defense again.

813
00:29:01,095 --> 00:29:02,9
You know,
perhaps you two are closer

814
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,3
to getting back together
than I thought.

815
00:29:04,057 --> 00:29:06,5
- You are?
- No, we haven't decided.

816
00:29:06,074 --> 00:29:08,0
Things are moving
that way.

817
00:29:08,028 --> 00:29:09,2
We just had the one kiss.

818
00:29:09,049 --> 00:29:11,5
So you're kissing now?
Right.

819
00:29:11,075 --> 00:29:13,6
Maybe that explains
why you won't have sex with me.

820
00:29:13,087 --> 00:29:15,5
I'm sorry, what?

821
00:29:15,075 --> 00:29:16,1
No.

822
00:29:16,038 --> 00:29:17,5
You're juggling

823
00:29:17,071 --> 00:29:20,1
both these handsome gentlemen?

824
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:22,8
I'm not juggling anything.

825
00:29:23,001 --> 00:29:25,1
Well, trust me, honey,
you better do something,

826
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,8
'cause you're not
getting any younger.

827
00:29:27,001 --> 00:29:29,0
However, what do I know?
Because I'm just a child.

828
00:29:29,026 --> 00:29:31,2
If you don't like it, why don't
you stop acting like one?

829
00:29:31,047 --> 00:29:34,5
(laughing)

830
00:29:34,077 --> 00:29:37,8
You guys sound
just like me and my dad.

831
00:29:38,006 --> 00:29:42,0
We used to fight all the time
over the dumbest stuff.

832
00:29:43,036 --> 00:29:44,2
That's why I left.

833
00:29:44,045 --> 00:29:47,9
But no matter what I did,
I couldn't get away.

834
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,2
You know,
'cause every time

835
00:29:50,045 --> 00:29:52,7
I cooked a meal
or I looked in the mirror,

836
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,5
there he was staring back at me.

837
00:29:56,075 --> 00:29:57,8
That's a tad bit creepy.

838
00:29:58,008 --> 00:30:00,7
Because he's a part of me, man.

839
00:30:00,092 --> 00:30:02,7
You know, he may have
pushed too hard,

840
00:30:02,096 --> 00:30:05,3
and-and-and tried to make me
something that I'm not,

841
00:30:05,051 --> 00:30:09,8
but in the end,
it made me the man I am.

842
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:12,0
And I'm proud
of who I've become.

843
00:30:12,027 --> 00:30:14,3
Yeah, I came back home

844
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:17,4
so I could tell him
that I was clean.

845
00:30:17,069 --> 00:30:19,8
And I want to be a chef again.

846
00:30:20,006 --> 00:30:21,7
And this meal?

847
00:30:21,094 --> 00:30:24,1
was what I was gonna make
for him to prove it.

848
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,9
Well, it looks

849
00:30:26,015 --> 00:30:28,7
very good.

850
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:33,1
I didn't kill my dad.

851
00:30:33,037 --> 00:30:37,0
All right, so either
arrest me or let me go.

852
00:30:38,088 --> 00:30:40,7
Well, we are gonna
need you to come downtown,

853
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,8
and make a statement.

854
00:30:42,005 --> 00:30:43,6
DAN:
Please.

855
00:30:43,088 --> 00:30:45,8
Let me-- I'm happy to have
an excuse to leave.

856
00:30:46,005 --> 00:30:47,0
Dan...

857
00:30:47,022 --> 00:30:48,9
Don't go.

858
00:30:50,047 --> 00:30:53,0
I wanted one reason
to stick up for you.

859
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:56,9
Just one.
Let's go, pal.

860
00:31:00,077 --> 00:31:02,0
Well...

861
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:04,5
I have suddenly
lost my appetite.

862
00:31:04,073 --> 00:31:06,3
(sighs)

863
00:31:06,057 --> 00:31:08,9
Absolutely.

864
00:31:09,011 --> 00:31:10,6
I hope you're happy.

865
00:31:10,087 --> 00:31:13,3
No, actually,
I'm extremely disappointed.

866
00:31:13,054 --> 00:31:15,0
- Because you ruined dinner?
- No.

867
00:31:15,025 --> 00:31:17,7
Because Junior's answer
was spectacularly unhelpful.

868
00:31:17,087 --> 00:31:20,5
He didn't escape his father
because he turned into him.

869
00:31:20,075 --> 00:31:22,9
I mean, that doesn't
apply to me at all!

870
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,6
(sighs)

871
00:31:38,018 --> 00:31:39,0
(clears throat)

872
00:31:39,023 --> 00:31:40,4
So I cleaned up.

873
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,2
The food, I mean.

874
00:31:42,044 --> 00:31:43,9
It wasn't quite the same
as Chef Javier's.

875
00:31:44,019 --> 00:31:46,6
But I have to admit,
the boy can cook, so...

876
00:31:46,082 --> 00:31:50,1
I see you're still
working the case.

877
00:31:50,036 --> 00:31:51,7
You were right.

878
00:31:51,099 --> 00:31:53,2
Junior's innocent.

879
00:31:53,049 --> 00:31:55,6
Well, glad you learned
something at dinner.

880
00:31:55,087 --> 00:31:57,0
No, the lab called.

881
00:31:57,025 --> 00:31:58,7
The heroin that
we found at Naomi's

882
00:31:58,091 --> 00:32:00,7
doesn't match the kind
that killed Javier.

883
00:32:00,096 --> 00:32:02,3
So if Junior didn't
kill his dad,

884
00:32:02,054 --> 00:32:04,8
why use heroin?

885
00:32:05,009 --> 00:32:07,0
To frame him, maybe?

886
00:32:07,021 --> 00:32:08,0
Yeah.

887
00:32:08,021 --> 00:32:09,6
I thought about that, too.

888
00:32:09,088 --> 00:32:11,8
But the only person with motive
got poisoned herself.

889
00:32:12,005 --> 00:32:13,8
Unless she knew exactly
how much to give herself.

890
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:16,4
Creating all
the gruesome symptoms,

891
00:32:16,068 --> 00:32:19,6
but without the finale,
yeah...

892
00:32:19,081 --> 00:32:22,0
But the restaurant
was hers,

893
00:32:22,027 --> 00:32:24,0
so why would she do it?

894
00:32:25,065 --> 00:32:27,5
I don't know, maybe Pops
had a change of heart.

895
00:32:27,073 --> 00:32:29,6
Decided to bring Junior
back into the fold

896
00:32:29,086 --> 00:32:32,2
after he found out he'd changed
and was coming home?

897
00:32:40,033 --> 00:32:41,7
Yeah, this is Detective Decker.

898
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:44,2
I'm calling about a patient,
Anne Martin.

899
00:32:44,042 --> 00:32:45,3
Yeah.

900
00:32:46,088 --> 00:32:48,3
An hour ago?

901
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:50,4
Yeah, thanks.

902
00:32:52,072 --> 00:32:54,5
Guess who checked out
against orders.

903
00:32:54,076 --> 00:32:57,5
Well, I wonder where
our lovely sous-chef's

904
00:32:57,076 --> 00:32:59,2
headed in such a hurry.

905
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:01,3
(chuckles)

906
00:33:08,082 --> 00:33:10,6
LUCIFER:
Bravo.

907
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:12,1
That's a brilliant
hiding place.

908
00:33:12,036 --> 00:33:13,7
No wonder the police
couldn't find it earlier.

909
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:15,1
What are you doing here?

910
00:33:15,037 --> 00:33:16,8
Well, we'd ask you
the same question,

911
00:33:17,003 --> 00:33:17,8
but we already know
you're destroying evidence.

912
00:33:17,099 --> 00:33:19,4
Because you killed Javier.

913
00:33:19,066 --> 00:33:21,8
I told you, I would never do
anything to hurt Javier.

914
00:33:22,004 --> 00:33:24,1
You seem genuinely upset.

915
00:33:24,037 --> 00:33:26,1
Like you didn't want
Javier to die.

916
00:33:26,033 --> 00:33:28,8
You humans are quite
the paradox, aren't you?

917
00:33:29,005 --> 00:33:30,5
You're always killing
your loved ones and...

918
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,6
Unless the poison
wasn't meant for him.

919
00:33:32,088 --> 00:33:35,3
You meant to kill Junior,
didn't you?

920
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:36,6
What?

921
00:33:36,089 --> 00:33:38,0
Oh.

922
00:33:38,022 --> 00:33:39,6
Hence the drugs.

923
00:33:39,081 --> 00:33:41,3
He'd die
a grisly death,

924
00:33:41,056 --> 00:33:43,0
and we'd assume
he simply got a bad fix.

925
00:33:43,027 --> 00:33:44,8
Oh, that is very clever.

926
00:33:45,006 --> 00:33:46,4
Except you didn't realize
that Junior changed

927
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,1
while he was away--
he stopped eating meat.

928
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,6
LUCIFER: Which is why
his father ate his food,

929
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:52,6
and you killed the man you love.

930
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:55,0
Ooh, a cruel twist of fate.

931
00:33:55,024 --> 00:33:56,8
You don't know what
you're talking about.

932
00:33:57,007 --> 00:33:58,8
So when we test that powder in
your hand, you're telling me

933
00:33:59,008 --> 00:34:00,4
it's not gonna match the
poison that killed Javier?

934
00:34:00,066 --> 00:34:03,5
That ungrateful kid did not
deserve this place.

935
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:06,3
He was given everything,
and he threw it all away.

936
00:34:06,058 --> 00:34:09,3
But it didn't matter.

937
00:34:09,059 --> 00:34:12,0
'Cause he was still
the favorite.

938
00:34:12,026 --> 00:34:15,0
Because he was worthy
of his father's love.

939
00:34:15,026 --> 00:34:17,5
And he had a chance at
redemption until you ruined it.

940
00:34:28,081 --> 00:34:30,0
Are you okay?

941
00:34:30,023 --> 00:34:32,4
This place can't
possibly be up to code.

942
00:34:32,061 --> 00:34:33,6
We've got to get out of here.

943
00:34:34,094 --> 00:34:36,5
Damn it,
there's nowhere to go.

944
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:41,5
Oh, no, no, no, no,
this is not how it goes down,

945
00:34:41,074 --> 00:34:43,6
not by a long shot, Dad.

946
00:34:43,087 --> 00:34:45,7
Lucifer,
if you have any ideas...

947
00:34:47,033 --> 00:34:48,6
...now's the time.

948
00:34:55,021 --> 00:34:57,3
CHLOE:
You can put me down.

949
00:34:57,059 --> 00:34:58,8
LUCIFER:
Right.

950
00:34:59,009 --> 00:35:00,2
Happy now?

951
00:35:05,027 --> 00:35:06,8
(Lucifer scoffs)

952
00:35:07,006 --> 00:35:08,8
The Devil gets burned by fire.

953
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:10,5
Could this be any more ironic?

954
00:35:10,077 --> 00:35:12,5
- (chuckles)
- Ah.

955
00:35:12,073 --> 00:35:14,4
Does my pain amuse you,
Detective?

956
00:35:14,061 --> 00:35:16,0
A little bit.

957
00:35:16,028 --> 00:35:17,5
And so does this.

958
00:35:17,078 --> 00:35:20,5
(laughs)

959
00:35:20,078 --> 00:35:22,6
You little rascal.

960
00:35:24,012 --> 00:35:26,0
(indistinct radio transmission)

961
00:35:29,037 --> 00:35:31,2
LUCIFER:
Nice and tight.

962
00:35:31,042 --> 00:35:32,9
Ah. Oh, thank you.

963
00:35:35,005 --> 00:35:37,2
Anne was arrested
a few blocks away,

964
00:35:37,042 --> 00:35:40,5
so she'll be eating prison slop
for a long time to come.

965
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,6
Ah, her own personal
hell indeed.

966
00:35:45,064 --> 00:35:48,1
Thank you. For getting me out.

967
00:35:49,094 --> 00:35:51,7
Well, couldn't exactly rush
out of there alone.

968
00:35:51,094 --> 00:35:53,0
How would that look?
(chuckles)

969
00:35:53,027 --> 00:35:55,4
That's it?

970
00:35:56,065 --> 00:35:58,9
No "thanks for saving me first"?

971
00:35:59,011 --> 00:36:01,1
Is that what happened?

972
00:36:02,082 --> 00:36:04,4
It's funny,
it's all so fuzzy now.

973
00:36:04,062 --> 00:36:06,4
Must be the third-degree burns.

974
00:36:06,062 --> 00:36:08,1
(chuckles)

975
00:36:10,025 --> 00:36:11,7
Can't believe it's gone.

976
00:36:11,096 --> 00:36:15,0
We found out what your dad
never got to tell you.

977
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,9
He was gonna leave you
the restaurant all along.

978
00:36:20,047 --> 00:36:21,3
If you even want it.

979
00:36:21,051 --> 00:36:24,6
I think I do.

980
00:36:24,085 --> 00:36:27,6
And maybe I could rebuild it.

981
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:29,2
You know, make it my own.

982
00:36:32,019 --> 00:36:33,3
(knocking at door)

983
00:36:33,056 --> 00:36:35,4
Uh, hang on, just a second.

984
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:36,9
Maze.

985
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:40,2
I'm surprised you came back.

986
00:36:40,049 --> 00:36:41,2
I made a friend today.

987
00:36:41,049 --> 00:36:43,8
That's fantastic news.

988
00:36:44,003 --> 00:36:45,4
Who?

989
00:36:45,066 --> 00:36:47,8
An eight-year-old girl
who wandered into the bar.

990
00:36:48,008 --> 00:36:50,5
Well...

991
00:36:50,075 --> 00:36:52,8
That's a start.

992
00:36:53,008 --> 00:36:54,9
Perhaps the next one can be
of legal drinking age.

993
00:36:55,017 --> 00:36:58,5
Yeah, I was thinking
the same thing.

994
00:36:58,075 --> 00:37:00,3
Yeah.

995
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:03,2
So are you... busy tonight?

996
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:08,0

Oh, it's, uh...

1000
00:37:16,019 --> 00:37:18,6
it's been kind of
a rough night.

1001
00:37:18,086 --> 00:37:21,3
So I could use a drink.

1002
00:37:21,053 --> 00:37:22,7
Here.

1003
00:37:31,016 --> 00:37:34,0
What are you...
what are you doing up?

1004
00:37:34,029 --> 00:37:36,4
I have an early flight.

1005
00:37:36,058 --> 00:37:38,7
And I didn't want to leave
without saying good-bye.

1006
00:37:38,096 --> 00:37:42,1
But you just got home.

1007
00:37:42,038 --> 00:37:45,1
Look, I know

1008
00:37:45,038 --> 00:37:48,0
I haven't always been
the easiest mom.

1009
00:37:49,068 --> 00:37:51,5
I could be pushy.

1010
00:37:51,072 --> 00:37:53,6
Overbearing.

1011
00:37:53,089 --> 00:37:55,5
I am sorry

1012
00:37:55,073 --> 00:37:58,8
that you felt that you
always had to be the adult.

1013
00:37:59,007 --> 00:38:03,8
All I ever wanted was
for you to be happy.

1014
00:38:04,007 --> 00:38:05,9
I know.

1015
00:38:06,016 --> 00:38:10,7
And sometimes I think
you could just take a leap.

1016
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,6
Hmm.

1017
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:16,2
(chuckles)

1018
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:17,7

00:38:17,096 --> 00:38:19,4

It's awfully late to be
calling a meet, huh?

1026
00:38:44,094 --> 00:38:47,4
You were right.

1027
00:38:47,061 --> 00:38:50,4
Lucifer Morningstar
is insane and dangerous.

1028
00:38:50,062 --> 00:38:52,2
And he deserves
everything he gets.

1029
00:38:52,049 --> 00:38:54,2
Well, that works out perfectly.

1030
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:56,0
(chuckles)

1031
00:39:01,017 --> 00:39:02,7
But I can't let you kill him.

1032
00:39:05,026 --> 00:39:06,9
Come on, man.

1033
00:39:07,013 --> 00:39:09,0
I mean, we talked
about this.

1034
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:12,7
You know, I go down,
you go down.

1035
00:39:12,097 --> 00:39:14,3
Then I go down.

1036
00:39:14,056 --> 00:39:16,0
It's too bad.

1037
00:39:17,077 --> 00:39:19,1
(handcuffs clicking)
I mean,

1038
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,9
I thought we had something
really special going.

1039
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,5

This is unexpected.

1054
00:40:48,057 --> 00:40:51,0
You said the door's always open,

1055
00:40:51,024 --> 00:40:53,0

through it.

1056
00:40:53,024 --> 00:40:54,9
Mmm.

1057
00:40:55,012 --> 00:40:57,3
Right, well, I was just on my
way out to meet the Brittanys,

1058
00:40:57,058 --> 00:41:00,7
but... I suppose they
can occupy each other.

1059
00:41:00,091 --> 00:41:03,0
Great.

1060
00:41:03,025 --> 00:41:04,5
Then have a seat.

1061
00:41:04,075 --> 00:41:06,5
Yes. Has something happened--

1062
00:41:06,075 --> 00:41:09,5
I'm guessing by the looks
of it-- with Dan perhaps?

1063
00:41:09,076 --> 00:41:10,5
Mmm.

1064
00:41:10,076 --> 00:41:12,4
You mean Detective Douche?

1065
00:41:12,063 --> 00:41:14,2
(laughs) Yes, well, of course
that's what I mean,

1066
00:41:14,047 --> 00:41:15,7
but the bigger question here
is: why do you mean that?

1067
00:41:15,093 --> 00:41:18,7
We weren't even back together,

1068
00:41:18,093 --> 00:41:21,0
and he ended it with me tonight.

1069
00:41:21,027 --> 00:41:22,7
With a text.

1070
00:41:22,094 --> 00:41:24,7
I mean, what,
are we in high school?

1071
00:41:24,098 --> 00:41:27,4
Well, we're certainly
drinking like we are.

1072
00:41:27,069 --> 00:41:30,2
Why don't you have
a seat over here

1073
00:41:30,048 --> 00:41:32,4
and tell me all about it, hmm?

1074
00:41:32,061 --> 00:41:34,4
I just feel like an idiot.

1075
00:41:34,061 --> 00:41:37,7
I can't believe that I would
let myself care for him again.

1076
00:41:37,095 --> 00:41:39,4
I mean, why?

1077
00:41:39,062 --> 00:41:40,8
So I get hurt?

1078
00:41:41,004 --> 00:41:43,1
Um, no, because
you're a kind person

1079
00:41:43,037 --> 00:41:45,5
who puts the needs
of others before your own.

1080
00:41:45,071 --> 00:41:48,7
It's a horrible irony
that my father invented.

1081
00:41:48,096 --> 00:41:50,4
But you don't do that.

1082
00:41:50,063 --> 00:41:52,1
You just take what you want.

1083
00:41:52,038 --> 00:41:54,8
Since the beginning of time.

1084
00:41:55,005 --> 00:41:56,5
That's nice.

1085
00:41:56,072 --> 00:41:58,5
(both chuckle)

1086
00:42:01,093 --> 00:42:03,4
Uh...

1087
00:42:07,019 --> 00:42:08,3
What's happening?

1088
00:42:08,052 --> 00:42:12,1
It would seem
that I'm saying no.

1089
00:42:12,032 --> 00:42:15,4
But you've been trying to
get me into bed since day one.

1090
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:17,1
Why are you saying no?

1091
00:42:17,032 --> 00:42:19,1
Well, frankly, my dear,
I'm as baffled as you are.

1092
00:42:19,033 --> 00:42:20,6
I mean, usually
I'd leap at the chance

1093
00:42:20,083 --> 00:42:22,4
to fulfill my carnal desire,
but...

1094
00:42:22,066 --> 00:42:26,9
(sighs) for some reason,
I can't.

1095
00:42:27,017 --> 00:42:28,5
What am I doing?

1096
00:42:28,075 --> 00:42:30,6
Why am I here, drunk,
throwing myself at you?

1097
00:42:30,084 --> 00:42:32,3
This is so sad.

1098
00:42:32,051 --> 00:42:34,0
Well, it happens
to the best, I promise.

1099
00:42:34,022 --> 00:42:36,0
But not to me.

1100
00:42:36,022 --> 00:42:39,0
I don't do this.

1101
00:42:39,022 --> 00:42:43,0
This is something...

1102
00:42:43,022 --> 00:42:45,2
my mom would do.
