He still had his car keys,

72

so this was definitely not a robbery.

-Cause of death was this.

But it's not a big deal.
You know, just giving him some time.

when I heard a guy yelling,

92
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:48,4
"How much for the car?" You know,
something like that. I don't know.

93
00:04:48,053 --> 00:04:51,8
He was asking how much was the car.
I heard it all from my window.

94
00:04:52,008 --> 00:04:53,6
-And you live next door?
-Mm-hmm.

95
00:04:53,075 --> 00:04:55,4
-Did you see anything?
-No.

96
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,7
But I told him parking that car in
the driveway was just asking for trouble.

97
00:04:59,004 --> 00:05:00,2
He should have listened to me.

00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:01,7
-Thank you.
-[Dan] Excuse me, guys.

99
00:05:03,051 --> 00:05:06,2
So apparently the killer
was asking about the value of the car.

100
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,4
So why not just take it?

101
00:05:07,093 --> 00:05:11,1
I think I've got an answer for that.
Derek was a collector of vintage cars.

102
00:05:11,043 --> 00:05:13,4

at a private auction.

from the guy he outbid.

"I'm killing you. Before you pick up
that car, you'll be dead."

Great. Do we know who he is?

107
00:05:21,048 --> 00:05:23,4
The messages are anonymous,
but according to this,

108
00:05:23,057 --> 00:05:26,3
Derek was supposed to get possession
of the car this afternoon

109
00:05:26,045 --> 00:05:30,2

called Malibu Motor Enthusiasts.

Even I can't get in there,
and I know my cars.

00:05:38,096 --> 00:05:40,7
Plus, they're just shady
and gray market enough

115
00:05:40,084 --> 00:05:42,3
that if you show up to serve a warrant,

116
00:05:42,046 --> 00:05:45,0
they will literally stall you at the door
while everyone scatters.

117
00:05:45,013 --> 00:05:46,5
So then how do you get in?

118
00:05:46,063 --> 00:05:49,5
Well, the only way is to show up
with your own set of vintage wheels.

119

I'll come with you.

Really?

163
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:44,3
Yes. I think that closing this case
might be just what the doctor ordered.

Couldn't you have just
brought the Corvette?

167
00:08:09,053 --> 00:08:11,6
Please, detective,
Corvettes are a dime a dozen.

168
00:08:11,078 --> 00:08:14,2
Besides, I want this case to be special.

169
00:08:16,087 --> 00:08:18,6
[Chloe] Well, it's pretty straightforward.

170
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:21,9
We couldn't trace the threatening text
sent to our victim.

171
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,2
But if the killer murdered Derek
just to win the auction, well...

of all the boring details.

It is very nostalgic.

Okay. So the car that Derek won
was a Tucker 48.

179

If we find the car, then whoever it's
being handed off to may be our killer.

is our killer.

Sorry, coming through.

183
00:08:56,091 --> 00:08:59,5
Coming through. Ooh, lovely shirt. Joking.

184
00:08:59,087 --> 00:09:01,6
That man is wanted by the police.

185
00:09:02,087 --> 00:09:04,5
-[camera clicks]
-[Lucifer laughs]

186
00:09:04,058 --> 00:09:07,2
Well, we can't miss the part of the case
where we chase the suspect.

187
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:08,8
Or you chase and I watch, I mean.

188
00:09:09,017 --> 00:09:10,5
Or you could help this time.

189
00:09:10,063 --> 00:09:12,3
Guys, please. Please, please.

190
00:09:13,021 --> 00:09:14,6
-[man] Get out of the way!
-[rip]

191
00:09:14,072 --> 00:09:16,2
[shouts from onlookers]

192
00:09:16,034 --> 00:09:17,2
[man] Whoa, whoa!

193
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,1
-[ding]
-[gasps]

194
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:23,2
[Lucifer] See? Didn't have to chase him
at all. He got tired.

195
00:09:23,072 --> 00:09:24,5
[sighs]

196
00:09:24,077 --> 00:09:26,6
Come on,
I thought that was one of my better puns.

197
00:09:26,077 --> 00:09:28,4
More than worthy of our final case.

198
00:09:28,056 --> 00:09:29,4
Wait, what?

199
00:09:29,048 --> 00:09:31,1
Well, I'm just trying to appreciate

200
00:09:31,027 --> 00:09:33,5
every moment of the last time
we're working together.

201
00:09:34,057 --> 00:09:36,7
One final case
to get closure on the whole thing.

202
00:09:37,003 --> 00:09:39,7
Okay. Can we talk about this another time?

203
00:09:40,032 --> 00:09:44,3
You have to listen to me. I hated Derek,
but I would never kill anyone, I swear.

204
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,3
Detective, please.
One last time for posterity.

205
00:09:48,037 --> 00:09:49,2
Go ahead.

206
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,7
Kev, tell me...

207
00:09:52,034 --> 00:09:54,3
what is it that you truly desire?

208
00:09:54,076 --> 00:09:56,2
Power? Wealth?

209
00:09:57,001 --> 00:09:58,0
Better dress sense?

210
00:09:58,068 --> 00:09:59,5
I...

211
00:10:03,064 --> 00:10:06,3
To tell the truth
so I don't go to jail for murder.

212
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:10,6
[Chloe] What? If that's the case,
then why did you run?

213
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:12,7
'Cause I thought you were here
about the kit cars.

214
00:10:12,082 --> 00:10:16,0
Kit cars? You mean those awful replicas
that only look vintage?

215
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,9
Those don't fool anybody with taste.

216
00:10:18,003 --> 00:10:19,9
[man] True, but you can make
a ton of money selling them

217
00:10:19,099 --> 00:10:21,7
to goobers who can't tell the difference.

218
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,9
It's not like it's illegal.

219
00:10:23,008 --> 00:10:23,9
Sounds illegal.

220
00:10:24,074 --> 00:10:26,9
It is illegal, but it's not murder.

221
00:10:27,004 --> 00:10:28,1
Listen, we saw the messages.

222
00:10:28,025 --> 00:10:31,6
You said that you wanted to kill him
before he could collect on this auction.

223
00:10:31,071 --> 00:10:33,4
Kill his reputation.

224
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:36,0
I was going to tell everyone
I sold him a couple of kits.

225
00:10:36,013 --> 00:10:38,2
Your rep is all you have in our world.

226
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:41,3
Yes, what a tragedy
to lose the respect of these...

227
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:43,2
people.

228
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,8
[man] Look, he was killed
this morning, right?

229
00:10:44,097 --> 00:10:47,9
I was selling a kit Porsche 550
to a guy up in Fresno.

230
00:10:48,006 --> 00:10:49,7
I just flew back two hours ago.

231
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:50,9
[Chloe] Alright, we'll check that out.

232
00:10:51,002 --> 00:10:53,2
But unless you have
any other information, then...

233
00:10:53,031 --> 00:10:56,0
Wait. You should check out this guy
Derek's been hanging out with.

234
00:10:56,011 --> 00:10:58,1
Scary dude, shaved head.

235
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,5
Tattoos.

236
00:11:00,053 --> 00:11:01,9
Do you have the scary dude's name?

237
00:11:02,074 --> 00:11:04,3
I never saw him myself.

238
00:11:04,095 --> 00:11:06,6
Er... but I saw his car.

239
00:11:06,095 --> 00:11:11,0
He has an awful '92 Geo Metro
in Polynesian green.

240
00:11:11,017 --> 00:11:12,0
Oh.

241
00:11:12,012 --> 00:11:13,0
Ow! Oh, okay.

242
00:11:13,008 --> 00:11:15,9
[phone buzzes]

243
00:11:16,034 --> 00:11:17,5
Oh! Ah...

244
00:11:18,034 --> 00:11:20,6
The girl from the jewelry auction.

245
00:11:21,034 --> 00:11:22,9
You're still hanging out with her?

246
00:11:23,001 --> 00:11:23,8
Yes.

247
00:11:24,005 --> 00:11:25,7
Yes, she's been staying with me.

248
00:11:25,081 --> 00:11:27,2
-Hmm.
-[Lucifer] She's...

249
00:11:27,093 --> 00:11:28,7
Never mind.

250
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:32,1
So why don't we go and catch
this scary dude?

251
00:11:32,027 --> 00:11:34,1
He sounds like a worthy final killer.

252
00:11:35,044 --> 00:11:36,4
Okay.

253
00:11:44,045 --> 00:11:45,7
Lucy, are you here?

254
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:47,8
Listen, we...

255
00:11:48,054 --> 00:11:50,5
got your baby gift, but...

256
00:11:51,062 --> 00:11:53,9
Yeah, I don't think
these are teething rings.

257
00:11:54,058 --> 00:11:55,4
Amenadiel?

258
00:11:56,084 --> 00:11:57,8
Hey.

259
00:11:58,025 --> 00:11:59,2
Your brother's out.

260
00:11:59,092 --> 00:12:00,7
Eve.

261
00:12:02,026 --> 00:12:03,5
What are you doing here?

262
00:12:03,088 --> 00:12:04,9
Did you hurt Lucifer?

263
00:12:06,064 --> 00:12:08,6
Only when he asked me nicely.

264
00:12:08,093 --> 00:12:10,2
[giggles] Why?

265
00:12:10,077 --> 00:12:12,6
Because he killed Cain, Eve.

266
00:12:12,077 --> 00:12:13,6
Your son.

267
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:20,5
You know, I met Charlotte Richards
on my way out of heaven.

268
00:12:23,003 --> 00:12:24,0
She was lovely.

269
00:12:27,095 --> 00:12:29,4
Same as my sweet and...

270
00:12:30,004 --> 00:12:31,3
gentle Abel.

271
00:12:34,012 --> 00:12:36,0
Pretty sure he heard
what was coming to him.

272
00:12:36,013 --> 00:12:37,8
Then why would you leave the Silver City?

273
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:40,0
Look who's talking.

274
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:43,5
You're the one who couldn't wait
to tell everybody up there

275
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:46,5
how all of God's children
create their own fate.

276
00:12:47,043 --> 00:12:49,8
How we decide where we belong.

277
00:12:50,018 --> 00:12:52,8
[scoffs] That was different, Eve.

278
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:55,1
I'm an angel. You're mortal.

279
00:12:55,023 --> 00:12:56,9
Yes, I'm mortal.

280
00:12:57,002 --> 00:12:59,1
Created directly by the hand of God.

281
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:03,1
Hence me being able to slip right back
into my old bones.

282
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:05,9
Yes, you were able to come back
down here to Earth, Eve,

283
00:13:05,099 --> 00:13:07,9
but did you not even consider...

284
00:13:08,066 --> 00:13:11,9
that, after rejecting heaven,
you may not be allowed back in?

285
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:16,0
Why would I want to go back
to that boring place?

286
00:13:16,092 --> 00:13:19,5
I'm having the time of my life
down here with Lucifer.

287
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,0
And what happens
when that comes to an end?

288
00:13:22,017 --> 00:13:25,9
Well, if I get sent to hell, then...

289
00:13:27,064 --> 00:13:30,1
me and Lucifer can keep the party going
down there.

290
00:13:34,043 --> 00:13:36,3
[Lucifer] I've gotten to know all of you

291
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:38,6
in my time here,
which is what makes this...

292
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:42,1
my final case, so difficult.

293
00:13:42,027 --> 00:13:46,1
Dougie in the motor pool,
who helped put a siren on my car.

294
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,1
Thank you for that.

295
00:13:47,082 --> 00:13:52,2
Cucuzza in evidence, who always let me
inspect the cocaine seizures first.

296
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,7
[Lucifer chuckles]

297
00:13:54,087 --> 00:13:55,9
And you.

298
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:00,0
Nameless uni,
I think I'll miss you most of all.

299
00:14:01,038 --> 00:14:04,3
So anyway,
as a parting gift for everyone...

300
00:14:06,084 --> 00:14:11,1
I've hired a Carl's Jr. truck out in
the parking lot. Free burgers for you all.

301
00:14:11,026 --> 00:14:13,3
-[cheers]
-Go on! Knock yourselves out.

302
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:15,7
He's not really going to leave us, is he?

303
00:14:16,077 --> 00:14:19,6
No. Remember when Lucifer disappeared
and he came back married?

304
00:14:19,069 --> 00:14:22,7
I mean, this is how
he works through his issues.

305
00:14:22,086 --> 00:14:26,0
Er... soon enough, everything will be
back to normal, I'm sure.

306
00:14:26,011 --> 00:14:27,3
Yeah, you're totally right.

307
00:14:27,044 --> 00:14:30,2
He's going to burn out
on all these new ladies soon enough.

308
00:14:30,028 --> 00:14:32,6
-Actually, it's just the one lady.
-What?

309
00:14:33,045 --> 00:14:35,4
Some party girl named Eve.

310
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:37,1
Wait, what?

311
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,0
Are you serious?

312
00:14:39,037 --> 00:14:41,2
I mean, if you're serious, that's serious.

313
00:14:41,038 --> 00:14:44,3
I'm not worried. I am not worried at all.

314
00:14:44,042 --> 00:14:46,9
There is no way
she knows the real Lucifer like I do.

315
00:14:47,055 --> 00:14:48,8
-Ladies.
-[Chloe] Hi.

316
00:14:49,047 --> 00:14:51,3
Any news on our scary dude?

317
00:14:51,043 --> 00:14:56,8
Mm. Yes, so these 16 individuals drive
Geo Metros in the Tri-County area.

318
00:14:57,014 --> 00:14:59,5
Oh. Mike Tyson here, very scary looking.

319
00:15:00,023 --> 00:15:03,1
[Chloe] Now what about this guy
in the jailhouse tats?

320
00:15:03,023 --> 00:15:04,6
[Ella] That is Sid Kluge.

321
00:15:05,027 --> 00:15:07,7
Well, I think you hit the jackpot, Decker.

322
00:15:07,094 --> 00:15:10,2
Yeah, rap sheet full of B&Es
and aggravated assaults.

323
00:15:10,032 --> 00:15:13,4
And the address,
right off of Venice Boulevard,

324
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:15,4
near that dispensary that you love.

325
00:15:16,016 --> 00:15:18,2
Oh, detective, you know me so well.

326
00:15:18,066 --> 00:15:19,5
[Lucifer chuckles]

327
00:15:19,066 --> 00:15:21,9
I really will miss this
once the case is over.

328
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:27,0
Over?

329
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:29,0
Oh. [mouths silently]

330
00:15:31,005 --> 00:15:31,9
[Dan] Yo.

331
00:15:32,001 --> 00:15:32,8
[Maze] Hey.

332
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,1
Is that Drill-bit Bueller?

333
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,4
Yep.

334
00:15:37,051 --> 00:15:41,0
You know, he and his brother Sean are two
of the most feared guys in the streets.

335
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,5
Yeah, well, now they fear me.

336
00:15:43,073 --> 00:15:47,1
Hey, I was going after his brother next
and I was thinking...

337
00:15:48,003 --> 00:15:49,7
maybe you can jump in on the fun?

338
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,1
[chuckle]

339
00:15:52,007 --> 00:15:56,9
Look, Maze, that whole thing with Los Xs,
that was just a means to an end.

340
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:01,2
I mean, it's not like I get my kicks
by beating the hell out of people.

341
00:16:01,071 --> 00:16:05,3
Well, let me know
next time there's a means to an end...

342
00:16:05,092 --> 00:16:06,8
Dan.

343
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:13,7
So I was thinking...

344
00:16:14,043 --> 00:16:16,5
this doesn't have to be our last case.

345
00:16:16,064 --> 00:16:18,7
Oh, no, no. This is for the best, I think.

346
00:16:18,085 --> 00:16:21,5
There's no sense in dragging it out.
One last case should be enough.

347
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:23,1
Enough for what?

348
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:24,7
Well, for closure, of course.

349
00:16:25,044 --> 00:16:26,4
What does that mean?

350
00:16:27,011 --> 00:16:30,4
I... I'm not sure,
but the doctor told me I needed it.

351
00:16:32,011 --> 00:16:34,0
Lucifer, if you ever need to talk
about anything--

352
00:16:34,015 --> 00:16:35,5
I don't believe this.

353
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:38,7
-What?
-That geek was right about the car.

354
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:41,0
It's the most hideous thing
I've ever seen.

355
00:16:41,016 --> 00:16:43,0
Still, at least we know our killer's here.

356
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,7
[Chloe] Or not.

357
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,7
Hold on.

358
00:16:57,026 --> 00:17:00,8
Well, it looks like this case might
drag out a little longer than I thought.

359
00:17:05,006 --> 00:17:06,4
[Chloe] Huh.

360
00:17:08,002 --> 00:17:10,1
No way it's a coincidence

361
00:17:10,027 --> 00:17:13,9
that our number one suspect in
Derek's murder turns up dead hours later.

362
00:17:14,007 --> 00:17:15,6
There has to be a connection.

363
00:17:16,057 --> 00:17:19,2
I really had forgotten
how much fun this is.

364
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:21,9
You solving puzzles,
me trying to distract you...

365
00:17:22,045 --> 00:17:24,8
-waiting to come up with the big insight--
-Found it!

366
00:17:24,096 --> 00:17:27,5
-that breaks the case.
-Not only found it. I think...

367
00:17:27,071 --> 00:17:29,0
-[smack]
-I solved it.

368
00:17:29,013 --> 00:17:30,8
-[Chloe] What?
-There's Derek, Sid.

369
00:17:30,096 --> 00:17:32,0
And recognize that third guy?

370
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:34,5
Yeah, one of the witnesses we talked to.

371
00:17:34,067 --> 00:17:37,4
Yeah. Marco Franklin.

372
00:17:37,051 --> 00:17:40,3
All three of them served in
the Explosives Ordnance division in Iraq.

373
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:41,4
But, wait, there's more.

374
00:17:41,051 --> 00:17:44,7
Marco was just released from prison
two days ago

375
00:17:44,081 --> 00:17:46,8
after serving a nine-year sentence
for bank robbery.

376
00:17:47,023 --> 00:17:50,6
He bombed his way into the vault,
got caught coming out and, drum roll,

377
00:17:50,077 --> 00:17:53,9
it is suspected he had two
other accomplices, never apprehended.

378
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:57,2
So Sid and Derek were his partners.
He gets caught, they don't.

379
00:17:57,028 --> 00:17:59,2
Maybe they double-crossed him.
So now he's out--

380
00:17:59,028 --> 00:18:00,3
Looking for closure.

381
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:02,0
Yeah. Call it whatever you want.

382
00:18:02,016 --> 00:18:04,3
I call it solved!

383
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,9
[Chloe] That's a great theory,
but, right now, that's all it is.

384
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,2
We have no proof,
so the killer could be anyone.

385
00:18:09,037 --> 00:18:11,8
Agreed. This doesn't really feel
like closure to me.

386
00:18:11,096 --> 00:18:13,6
-It doesn't.
-[Lucifer] There must be more.

387
00:18:13,075 --> 00:18:15,8
Witnesses saw a man
matching Marco's description

388
00:18:15,088 --> 00:18:17,8
attacking Sid in front of his apartment.

389
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:19,1
-Circumstantial.
-Agreed.

390
00:18:19,022 --> 00:18:21,4
Decker, you are putting me
through the wringer.

391
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,6
Respect. But I got you beat.

392
00:18:23,076 --> 00:18:26,3
The striations on the shell casings
found at the scene

393
00:18:26,048 --> 00:18:27,9
match Marco's 9mm.

394
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:30,6
I made sure
all the bases were covered for you.

395
00:18:30,085 --> 00:18:31,9
Boom!

396
00:18:32,056 --> 00:18:35,1
-We still have to pick him up.
-Yes, until the suspect's in custody

397
00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:36,9
the case isn't truly closed, is it?

398
00:18:36,099 --> 00:18:39,0
-Way ahead of you.
-Oh, for crying out loud.

399
00:18:39,011 --> 00:18:41,9
Dan helped me with the records.
He's on his way to Marco's address now,

400
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:42,8
with some unis.

401
00:18:42,091 --> 00:18:46,0
Nothing left for us to do now, folks,
but get our party on.

402
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,7
What are you guys thinking?

403
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:50,0
I feel like dancing.
I'm going to go change.

404
00:18:53,013 --> 00:18:54,5
Lucifer, we can still--

405
00:18:54,063 --> 00:18:55,4
No.

406
00:18:55,084 --> 00:18:56,7
Detective...

407
00:18:58,005 --> 00:19:00,5
I think this is best for me
and for everyone.

408
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:03,8
I just want to say...

409
00:19:06,056 --> 00:19:07,8
great last case.

410
00:19:09,006 --> 00:19:10,1
Great partnership.

411
00:19:15,073 --> 00:19:16,5
Right.

412
00:19:22,003 --> 00:19:25,5
["For My Eyes Only" by New City playing]

413
00:19:34,038 --> 00:19:35,6
Here you go, Eve.

414
00:19:35,071 --> 00:19:37,3
[laughs] Oh, thank you!

415
00:19:38,067 --> 00:19:39,7
[Eve] Mm.

416
00:19:40,063 --> 00:19:41,5
You're Eve?

417
00:19:42,026 --> 00:19:43,9
Yeah. Do we know each other?

418
00:19:44,005 --> 00:19:45,9
I'm Ella Lopez and you need to--

419
00:19:46,001 --> 00:19:47,1
You're Ella?

420
00:19:47,068 --> 00:19:48,6
Oh, my God.

421
00:19:49,027 --> 00:19:52,0
Oh, how dare you use hugs against me?

422
00:19:53,065 --> 00:19:55,9
Wow, you're even prettier in real life.

423
00:19:56,057 --> 00:20:00,8
I've been dying to meet you
since Lucifer told me how amazing you are.

424
00:20:01,024 --> 00:20:02,6
-He said that?
-Oh, yeah.

425
00:20:02,074 --> 00:20:05,1
I saw you out there on the dance floor.

426
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,2
You've got moves!

427
00:20:07,033 --> 00:20:10,1
I've got to say,
I saw you out there, girlfriend.

428
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:13,2
-You've got some sick moves yourself.
-Really?

429
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:15,3
-Yeah.
-Would you see this guy?

430
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:19,1
Oh, my God, that's called "the robot".
I just learned that this morning.

431
00:20:19,025 --> 00:20:21,3
[sighs] You're pretty cool.

432
00:20:22,017 --> 00:20:24,0
We're both pretty cool.

433
00:20:26,097 --> 00:20:27,8
[slap]

434
00:20:28,043 --> 00:20:31,2
Hey, a friend just gave me some candy.
Do you want some?

435
00:20:31,035 --> 00:20:34,6
That's... not candy.

436
00:20:34,073 --> 00:20:35,6
Okay? That's Molly.

437
00:20:35,077 --> 00:20:36,7
Molly?

438
00:20:37,031 --> 00:20:38,5
Well, that sounds fun.

439
00:20:39,082 --> 00:20:40,6
Yes.

440
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:43,6
-Yes, it does.
-Yeah!

441
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,5
[bell rings]

442
00:20:47,087 --> 00:20:48,7
Brother.

443
00:20:49,095 --> 00:20:52,8
How's it going
with the teenage mutant ninja angel baby?

444
00:20:53,021 --> 00:20:55,0
Why didn't you tell me that Eve was here,
Lucy?

445
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,0
Oh, please. I'm not going to text you
every time someone stays the night.

446
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:01,8
-Think of my data plan.
-This isn't just some fling, Lucifer.

447
00:21:02,071 --> 00:21:03,9
This is Eve.

448
00:21:05,068 --> 00:21:08,1
-Eve.
-Yes, I know what her name is.

449
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:11,6
I really don't think that you understand
the dangers of having Eve back here.

450
00:21:11,077 --> 00:21:14,8
If you're worried
about what happened last time, don't be.

451
00:21:14,094 --> 00:21:16,4
I'm not going to corrupt her.

452
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,6
Besides, I don't know how I could.
She's...

453
00:21:20,007 --> 00:21:21,8
pretty much up for anything these days.

454
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:24,1
Oh, it's not Eve that I'm worried about.

455
00:21:24,099 --> 00:21:25,8
It's you.

456
00:21:26,091 --> 00:21:27,7
Me?

457
00:21:28,003 --> 00:21:32,3
She came here for the old you,
the one she remembers from the garden.

458
00:21:32,054 --> 00:21:36,0
The one who sowed chaos and destruction
for his own amusement.

459
00:21:36,016 --> 00:21:37,5
Now you're making me nostalgic.

460
00:21:37,058 --> 00:21:40,2
You see, that's exactly
what I'm talking about, Lucy.

461
00:21:40,054 --> 00:21:44,4
I don't want her to turn you back
into the devil that you were.

462
00:21:44,063 --> 00:21:46,0
Oh, don't you now?

463
00:21:53,027 --> 00:21:54,1
To be honest...

464
00:21:54,085 --> 00:21:57,2
I don't even know
if I want to be with her or not.

465
00:21:57,035 --> 00:22:00,3
I was supposed to have clarity on that
after finishing this case, but...

466
00:22:01,057 --> 00:22:02,4
[Lucifer sighs]

467
00:22:02,069 --> 00:22:04,6
I still don't know what I bloody want.

[club music playing]

469
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:15,6
[Lucifer] Detective?

470
00:22:16,029 --> 00:22:17,5
-Hi.
-What are you doing here?

471
00:22:18,017 --> 00:22:20,1
-We still have a case.
-We do?

472
00:22:20,021 --> 00:22:22,2
Marco's place was cleared out,
so he's still out there.

473
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:25,3
That must explain my lack of closure.

474
00:22:26,009 --> 00:22:28,6
-Right. Wait there. I'll grab my jacket.
-Okay.

475
00:22:28,076 --> 00:22:30,5
Oh, my God, Chloe!

476
00:22:31,014 --> 00:22:32,8
You came out to celebrate.

477
00:22:32,093 --> 00:22:34,4
No, working. Working.

478
00:22:35,018 --> 00:22:38,2
This jacket is so fuzzy and amazing.

479
00:22:39,002 --> 00:22:40,0
Oh.

480
00:22:40,065 --> 00:22:43,1
It must be like being hugged by a muppet.

481
00:22:43,052 --> 00:22:45,4
-Okay.
-Oh, my God.

482
00:22:45,086 --> 00:22:48,6
Oh, my God,
I've got someone you have to meet.

483
00:22:49,003 --> 00:22:49,8
This...

484
00:22:50,066 --> 00:22:52,1
is Eve.

485
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,3
Yes, we have met.

486
00:22:53,045 --> 00:22:54,4
She gave me drugs.

487
00:22:54,091 --> 00:22:55,7
Really?

488
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,4
I need orange juice.

489
00:22:58,004 --> 00:23:00,1
Oh, my God. Isn't she amazing?

490
00:23:00,021 --> 00:23:03,3
I can see why Lucifer loves
working with you guys so much.

491
00:23:03,046 --> 00:23:05,1
Oh, that's nice.

492
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:07,3
Want my last Molly?
I was going to take it,

493
00:23:07,046 --> 00:23:09,8
but you look like someone
who could use it more than I do.

494
00:23:09,088 --> 00:23:10,8
Who are you?

495
00:23:10,093 --> 00:23:12,2
Oh, I'm Eve.

496
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:14,2
Okay, well, that doesn't help. Who...

497
00:23:16,035 --> 00:23:19,5
Wait. Do you mean as in Eve Eve,
as in Adam and Eve?

498
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:22,6
I can't believe
they still put his name first.

499
00:23:22,073 --> 00:23:25,1
These are supposed to be
more progressive times.

500
00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:28,2
-Wait. You and Lucifer were together.
-Mm-hmm.

501
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:31,8
So you know him.
You know who he really is.

just leave without the jacket.

I need you to listen to me carefully.

Much as I appreciate
the well-timed interruption,

516
00:23:59,098 --> 00:24:01,4

[man] Everybody, sit down!

524
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:23,9
There's a bomb in this building,

525
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,5
so if anyone thinks they're going
to escape through the crowd,

526
00:24:26,063 --> 00:24:28,7
or anyone tries to rush me-- back up!

527
00:24:29,005 --> 00:24:30,3
everyone dies.

528
00:24:30,084 --> 00:24:33,4
Detective Decker, give me your gun.
Put it on the ground.

529
00:24:33,051 --> 00:24:35,6
And your phone. Now.

530
00:24:38,085 --> 00:24:41,2
[Chloe] Okay, okay, whatever you say.

531
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:44,7
Whatever you say, but this man
needs an ambulance right now

532
00:24:44,081 --> 00:24:47,4
and I will stay with you,
but everybody here should go.

533
00:24:47,048 --> 00:24:48,8
No, shut up! Shut up, no.

534
00:24:49,011 --> 00:24:50,2
Nobody is leaving.

535
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:51,7
You...

536
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:53,7
go around and collect people's phones.

537
00:24:53,086 --> 00:24:55,5
Now! Get up, let's go!

538
00:24:56,007 --> 00:24:56,9
Come on.

539
00:24:57,003 --> 00:24:58,6
[Chloe, whispering] Are you okay?

540
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:01,2
[breathing hard]
A bit of a stomach ache, detective.

541
00:25:01,058 --> 00:25:04,0
[Eve] He's the devil though.
He's going to be okay, right?

542
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:06,2
Yeah. He's going to be fine.

543
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:07,7
We'll get help.

544
00:25:08,042 --> 00:25:10,1
You stay here with him, okay?

545
00:25:10,021 --> 00:25:12,6
[terrified whimpering behind]

546
00:25:12,071 --> 00:25:15,0
I know I should be freaking out right now,

547
00:25:15,034 --> 00:25:17,3
but your hair is so shiny.

548
00:25:18,014 --> 00:25:20,3
Marco, we know
you killed your former partners,

549
00:25:20,043 --> 00:25:23,3
but this is not going to help
the situation.

550
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,4
If you hurt me or anyone else here,

551
00:25:26,056 --> 00:25:28,9
it is only going to make things worse
for you.

552
00:25:28,098 --> 00:25:31,3
I don't want to hurt you, detective.

553
00:25:31,069 --> 00:25:32,6
I need your help.

554
00:25:32,094 --> 00:25:34,9
When I went away, my wife changed her name

555
00:25:35,003 --> 00:25:36,7
and I can't find her now.

556
00:25:37,007 --> 00:25:39,3
-You did all this to find your wife?
-Look...

557
00:25:39,091 --> 00:25:43,8
Shooting him was an accident, okay?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do it.

558
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:46,8
I'm just trying to...
just trying to fix things.

559
00:25:46,092 --> 00:25:48,7
[Lucifer] Oh, don't worry about it, pal.

560
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:51,6
You just give me the gun
and I'll even things up.

561
00:25:52,021 --> 00:25:55,8
[Marco] Look, when I went away to prison
for robbing that bank,

562
00:25:55,088 --> 00:25:56,8
it ruined her.

563
00:25:57,034 --> 00:25:59,9
You know, she disappeared,
and I understand.

564
00:26:00,005 --> 00:26:01,8
But... but I...

565
00:26:01,097 --> 00:26:06,6
I just want one chance to look her
in the eye and tell her that...

566
00:26:08,023 --> 00:26:09,9
I just want to tell her that I'm sorry.

567
00:26:11,011 --> 00:26:12,1
Okay.

568
00:26:12,057 --> 00:26:13,5
I want you...

569
00:26:14,011 --> 00:26:15,4
to find her now.

570
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:16,9
And then...

571
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:19,4
I will think about letting everyone go.

572
00:26:20,095 --> 00:26:21,7
Okay.

573
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:24,6
Got it.

574
00:26:24,091 --> 00:26:26,7
I'll take care of it, Chloe. You just...

575
00:26:27,033 --> 00:26:28,2
You stay safe.

576
00:26:32,013 --> 00:26:34,3
You guys don't go in unless I say so.
You got that?

577
00:26:34,038 --> 00:26:36,8
Perimeters are being set up.
We'll sit tight for now.

578
00:26:36,092 --> 00:26:39,5
Good. Our people are in there.
We're not going to take any risks.

579
00:26:39,068 --> 00:26:40,9
Did you give the breach point?

580
00:26:41,005 --> 00:26:42,3
No, the gunman was listening, but

581
00:26:42,085 --> 00:26:45,6
he did ask for some food to be delivered,
so I think I have an idea.

582
00:26:48,014 --> 00:26:49,3
-Got it?
-Got it.

583
00:26:50,094 --> 00:26:52,1
I heard Lux is under siege.

584
00:26:52,023 --> 00:26:54,1
-Yeah.
-Well, what are we waiting for?

585
00:26:54,023 --> 00:26:56,4
You can't just go in there
swinging your knives around--

586
00:26:56,048 --> 00:26:58,3
-That's exactly what I can do.
-You know what?

587
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,5
He has the entire place wired to blow.
It's too risky.

588
00:27:02,082 --> 00:27:03,9
Fine. What's your plan?

589
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:07,2
I'm looking for Leona.

590
00:27:08,012 --> 00:27:09,3
She's Marco's wife.

591
00:27:09,046 --> 00:27:12,1
Apparently, she changed her name
a few years after he went inside,

592
00:27:12,025 --> 00:27:14,7
but there are no records
of what she actually changed it to.

593
00:27:14,084 --> 00:27:15,8
It's like she vanished.

594
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:18,7
No public records.
No social security number.

595
00:27:19,017 --> 00:27:20,3
No social media footprint.

596
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,7
What is this? 2014?

597
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,8
Yeah, looks like it.

598
00:27:24,064 --> 00:27:27,1
In 2014, there was only one guy
who wasn't in jail

599
00:27:27,022 --> 00:27:29,1
who could help someone disappear
this cleanly.

600
00:27:29,027 --> 00:27:30,9
-So who is he?
-I don't know his name.

601
00:27:31,006 --> 00:27:32,0
But I can find out.

602
00:27:32,015 --> 00:27:34,3
Okay, I'll put together a warrant
so we can trace it.

603
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,1
-You want to get a warrant?
-Well, yeah.

604
00:27:36,019 --> 00:27:38,4
You're the guy who said
the ends justify the means.

605
00:27:38,057 --> 00:27:39,4
Legal means, Maze.

606
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:41,9
You must think like one of us
if you're going to have a shot--

607
00:27:42,003 --> 00:27:44,7
No! You have to think like them.

608
00:27:45,028 --> 00:27:47,9
That is how I catch them,
and that is how we'll get this guy.

609
00:27:52,054 --> 00:27:55,5
[Lucifer quietly coughing]

610
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,1
Lucifer, I'm so sorry I got you into this.

611
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:01,5
Nonsense.

612
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:05,5
You needed my Aston to get in
and nobody drives it but me.

613
00:28:05,085 --> 00:28:08,3
-I could have found another way. It's--
-No.

614
00:28:09,002 --> 00:28:10,2
It's not your fault.

615
00:28:10,093 --> 00:28:11,9
I needed closure.

616
00:28:13,006 --> 00:28:16,1
I just didn't expect it
to be quite so closed.

617
00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:18,3
[half-choking]

618
00:28:21,049 --> 00:28:25,1
This is all they had behind the bar.
Is there anything else I can get him?

619
00:28:25,095 --> 00:28:28,6
-We've got to get him to the hospital.
-No, I'm fine, Detective.

620
00:28:28,074 --> 00:28:30,7
You just get me
within an inch of that dullard

621
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:33,5
and I'll tear his arms off
like a turkey leg. Thank you.

622
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:36,2
[whispering] Focus, Decker. Focus.

623
00:28:36,071 --> 00:28:38,1
Lucifer's out of commission.

624
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,8
Ella is too.

625
00:28:40,059 --> 00:28:42,1
-Eve. Eve?
-Yeah?

626
00:28:42,022 --> 00:28:44,1
Do you have any superpowers or anything?

627
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:45,0
No.

628
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:46,4
I'm just me.

629
00:28:47,022 --> 00:28:49,0
[sighs] Right. So we've got nothing.

630
00:28:50,022 --> 00:28:51,1
No.

631
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,4
Chloe...

632
00:28:52,098 --> 00:28:55,1
we have you, okay?

633
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:57,1
Listen to me.

634
00:28:57,048 --> 00:28:58,6
From what Lucifer's told me,

635
00:28:58,077 --> 00:29:03,9
you are the smartest, most capable,
most resourceful person he's ever known.

636
00:29:04,032 --> 00:29:05,5
So come on, detective...

637
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,6
what's the plan?

638
00:29:08,074 --> 00:29:09,5
Okay.

639
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,5
-Yeah, plan.
-Yeah.

640
00:29:12,054 --> 00:29:13,9
Okay, Eve, you tend to Lucifer.

641
00:29:14,004 --> 00:29:15,2
Keep pressure on the wound

642
00:29:15,037 --> 00:29:16,4
to stop the bleeding.

643
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:18,4
I'm going to find
where he planted this bomb.

644
00:29:18,071 --> 00:29:21,0
And when I do, Ella... Ella!

645
00:29:21,013 --> 00:29:22,2
Can you diffuse it?

646
00:29:22,034 --> 00:29:23,3
Sure.

647
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:26,5
[Ella] You guys, I read the file

648
00:29:26,059 --> 00:29:29,9
on the demolition charges
Marco's unit built. Pff!

649
00:29:30,005 --> 00:29:31,6
Easy as pie. [laughs]

650
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:34,7
Lucifer, you have a job too.

651
00:29:34,081 --> 00:29:36,5
How do we sober up Ella?

652
00:29:37,027 --> 00:29:38,1
Hold this.

653
00:29:39,036 --> 00:29:40,4
I love you guys.

654
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:42,4
Not sober, but...

655
00:29:42,061 --> 00:29:43,6
[groans]

656
00:29:43,074 --> 00:29:44,7
how about focused?

657
00:29:45,015 --> 00:29:46,1
[coughs]

658
00:29:46,045 --> 00:29:48,9
It's the best way to lose your roll,
detective.

659
00:29:49,007 --> 00:29:50,3
[coughs]

660
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:59,1
Shared office workspace.

661
00:30:00,013 --> 00:30:01,9
Even I find this a bit cruel...

662
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,8
torture wise.

663
00:30:05,005 --> 00:30:10,3
Still, great place to hide if you're
selling fake IDs on the dark web.

664
00:30:12,001 --> 00:30:15,3
Erm, I'm... I don't know
what you're talking about.

665
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,1
My partner wanted to come in here
and question you,

666
00:30:18,027 --> 00:30:20,9
but I know someone like you
wouldn't just give it up.

667
00:30:21,094 --> 00:30:23,8
So I suggested we torture you.

668
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,3
Just a little bit.

669
00:30:26,036 --> 00:30:28,2
But he didn't like that idea.

670
00:30:28,032 --> 00:30:29,4
And then...

671
00:30:29,057 --> 00:30:30,4
Phew.

672
00:30:30,053 --> 00:30:32,3
he said something kind of smart.

673
00:30:32,087 --> 00:30:35,1
What's a criminal like you most afraid of?

674
00:30:37,046 --> 00:30:38,7
Losing your anonymity.

675
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:42,7
So I get to torture you after all.

676
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:46,7
Expose you to all of these people,
show them...

677
00:30:47,055 --> 00:30:49,6
what you've been trying to keep private.

678
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,3
[sighs]

679
00:30:51,076 --> 00:30:52,6
Please...

680
00:30:53,043 --> 00:30:54,2
I...

681
00:30:54,089 --> 00:30:58,6
I just do fan subtitles for anime.
I don't make fake IDs.

682
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,5
[whimpers]

683
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:01,9
I know.

684
00:31:02,002 --> 00:31:05,6
I was just trying to flush out the bad guy
and he just ran out the back.

685
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:07,7
[heavy footsteps]

686
00:31:07,082 --> 00:31:09,7
-[thud]
-[clatter]

687
00:31:09,082 --> 00:31:11,7
-[groans]
-[thud]

688
00:31:12,053 --> 00:31:13,4
Hi, Sergei.

689
00:31:13,058 --> 00:31:14,5
What do you want?

690
00:31:14,066 --> 00:31:17,4
I just help people disappear.
I didn't hurt anybody.

691
00:31:17,054 --> 00:31:18,7
Yeah, yeah. We know.

692
00:31:19,029 --> 00:31:21,5
And if you want to keep people
from being hurt...

693
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:26,0
you're going to tell us
everything you know about Leona Franklin.

694
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,6
[sighs]
The bleeding has slowed down a little.

695
00:31:46,048 --> 00:31:48,7
I gave him another drink.
That seemed to help.

696
00:31:50,024 --> 00:31:53,7
[sighs] Well, I've seen Lucifer
survive worse than this, so...

697
00:31:54,053 --> 00:31:55,9
I'm sure he'll pull through.

698
00:31:57,066 --> 00:31:58,7
He has to.

699
00:32:00,096 --> 00:32:02,0
I can't lose him.

700
00:32:03,075 --> 00:32:05,9
Not after we just found each other again.

701
00:32:07,063 --> 00:32:08,9
So you've seen...

702
00:32:09,055 --> 00:32:10,4
his devil face?

703
00:32:11,055 --> 00:32:12,4
Mm-hmm.

704
00:32:13,034 --> 00:32:14,3
Does it scare you?

705
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,5
Why would it?

706
00:32:17,072 --> 00:32:18,6
[sighs]

707
00:32:18,085 --> 00:32:19,6
I don't know.

708
00:32:22,056 --> 00:32:23,5
You know...

709
00:32:24,081 --> 00:32:27,9
I was literally created
to be someone's wife.

710
00:32:30,044 --> 00:32:33,1
No-one ever asked me
if that's what I really wanted.

711
00:32:35,041 --> 00:32:36,4
Except for him.

712
00:32:47,054 --> 00:32:50,4
[Eve] The key is in a wireless trigger.
It's either Bluetooth or cellular.

713
00:32:50,055 --> 00:32:52,2
Cellular would be a lot less complicated.

714
00:32:52,034 --> 00:32:53,8
The relay's got no proximity handicap.

715
00:32:53,093 --> 00:32:55,5
I see the cocaine is working.

716
00:32:55,064 --> 00:32:58,2
Really? How can you tell?
I don't feel any different.

717
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:01,6
Do you have any left?
I'd hate to return to hell sober.

718
00:33:01,072 --> 00:33:03,1
You are not going to hell.

719
00:33:03,018 --> 00:33:04,6
You need to stop saying that.

720
00:33:04,077 --> 00:33:06,1
Know what you also need to do?

721
00:33:06,023 --> 00:33:07,8
Stop talking about this as your last case.

722
00:33:08,006 --> 00:33:11,1
It's a real bummer, okay?
And I've really got to stay positive.

723
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,4
The detective and I
have worked together for far too long...

724
00:33:15,003 --> 00:33:18,1
to not accept each other
for who we truly are.

725
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:19,6
Sadly...

726
00:33:20,037 --> 00:33:22,6
I don't think that'll ever happen,
Miss Lopez.

727
00:33:22,075 --> 00:33:24,9
That is crazy. That is crazy.

728
00:33:25,029 --> 00:33:27,4
You guys are the best team ever. I mean,

729
00:33:27,054 --> 00:33:29,2
you care about each other so much.

730
00:33:29,034 --> 00:33:30,7
What do you need her to do?
Take a bullet for you?

731
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,9
[frightened murmurs]

732
00:33:32,042 --> 00:33:34,0
Oh, sorry.

733
00:33:34,047 --> 00:33:37,0
But seriously, okay,
you keep talking about closure.

734
00:33:37,014 --> 00:33:38,8
What the hell does that even mean?

735
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:40,1
That's the point.

736
00:33:40,076 --> 00:33:41,6
I don't know.

737
00:33:45,002 --> 00:33:47,7
[Chloe] Okay, he keeps looking upstairs.
I think I've found the bomb.

738
00:33:50,031 --> 00:33:52,8
[Leona]
I spent years building a new life here.

739
00:33:53,003 --> 00:33:56,4
I have a job and a boyfriend.
He doesn't know anything about my past.

740
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:58,2
-Leona--
-Amy.

741
00:33:59,003 --> 00:33:59,9
My name is Amy now.

742
00:34:00,037 --> 00:34:02,0
[Dan] Amy. Sorry.

743
00:34:02,024 --> 00:34:04,2
Look, after everything you went through,

744
00:34:04,037 --> 00:34:07,3
I'm sure that this is probably
your worst nightmare.

745
00:34:08,033 --> 00:34:10,1
But we only need you to talk to Marco.

746
00:34:10,054 --> 00:34:11,7
I'm sorry, I just...

747
00:34:14,026 --> 00:34:15,8
I don't think that I could face him again.

748
00:34:16,017 --> 00:34:18,0
Ready to do it my way?

749
00:34:21,055 --> 00:34:23,8
Look, I know this is a lot to ask of you.

750
00:34:26,027 --> 00:34:27,7
But there are lives at stake.

751
00:34:29,065 --> 00:34:31,5
People I care about are in that bar.

752
00:34:34,086 --> 00:34:36,1
And to be honest with you...

753
00:34:37,061 --> 00:34:40,3
I don't think I can handle
losing another person right now.

754
00:34:42,045 --> 00:34:43,4
Look, I'm trying...

755
00:34:45,045 --> 00:34:48,0
so hard to do things the right way.

756
00:34:50,096 --> 00:34:53,0
And maybe it's not right
for me to ask this of you...

757
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:55,3
but you can help them.

758
00:34:57,084 --> 00:34:59,3
And you may be the only one who can.

759
00:35:07,031 --> 00:35:08,3
[footsteps]

760
00:35:08,048 --> 00:35:09,8
[woman whimpers]

761
00:35:10,006 --> 00:35:11,0
[Marco] Finally.

762
00:35:12,061 --> 00:35:14,9
Argh, I ordered food over an hour ago.

763
00:35:18,036 --> 00:35:19,6
Green onions and ranch dressing.

764
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:25,1
Who the hell puts green onions
and ranch dressing on a sandwich?

765
00:35:25,066 --> 00:35:28,5
You'd better hope that your friends
are better at finding people

766
00:35:28,058 --> 00:35:30,4
than they are at taking food orders.

767
00:35:30,087 --> 00:35:32,6
Because I'm beginning to lose my patience!

768
00:35:32,071 --> 00:35:34,7
[frightened whimpers]

769
00:35:35,084 --> 00:35:36,7
Ah.

770
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:38,9
Dan wouldn't make a mistake like that.

771
00:35:39,005 --> 00:35:40,2
Are you sure?

772
00:35:40,042 --> 00:35:42,9
I once saw him eat a marble
because it was in a candy dish.

773
00:35:43,001 --> 00:35:44,6
No, no. Chloe's right.

774
00:35:44,076 --> 00:35:47,4
Now's not the time to make a mistake.
I'm not going to make a mistake.

775
00:35:47,056 --> 00:35:49,0
I'll defuse a bomb I've never seen

776
00:35:49,014 --> 00:35:51,4
before this crazy hangry bomber
blows us up. I can do that.

777
00:35:51,056 --> 00:35:52,4
I can do that.

778
00:35:53,094 --> 00:35:56,9
I don't think I can do that.
This is wrong, this is wrong.

779
00:35:57,002 --> 00:35:58,0
Sandwich is wrong.

780
00:35:58,015 --> 00:35:59,7
Maybe the sandwich isn't wrong.

781
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:01,1
Maybe there's a message in it.

782
00:36:01,057 --> 00:36:03,7
-I can't do that.
-We're going to be fine.

783
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:06,1
[Eve] Lucifer says
you're the smartest nerd he knows.

784
00:36:06,024 --> 00:36:08,0
[Ella]
But look what I've done to my brain.

785
00:36:08,012 --> 00:36:12,0
Okay, I have been partying all the time.
Like all the time.

786
00:36:12,012 --> 00:36:15,3
I think... I really think
I've just been looking for a connection.

787
00:36:15,042 --> 00:36:18,4
Something, anything, since I lost
what I had with the big guy and now I'm--

788
00:36:20,017 --> 00:36:21,3
Ladies...

789
00:36:21,097 --> 00:36:24,8
Oh, it's a comfort to know
I'll expire erect.

790
00:36:25,043 --> 00:36:26,3
Cheers.

791
00:36:28,068 --> 00:36:29,7
Oh, bollocks.

792
00:36:29,085 --> 00:36:30,8
This is the answer.

793
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:32,5
This is the answer.

794
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:35,2
[Chloe] It's a southwestern sandwich
from Luis's.

795
00:36:35,035 --> 00:36:37,1
Dan sent this because I'd recognize it.

796
00:36:37,027 --> 00:36:39,6
He's telling us that they'll breach
from the southwest.

797
00:36:40,028 --> 00:36:41,3
Is that a good thing?

798
00:36:42,032 --> 00:36:45,3
If we can get Ella to the bomb in time,
then yes.

799
00:36:46,099 --> 00:36:48,4
All you do is press this button.

800
00:36:48,078 --> 00:36:49,8
This isn't going to work.

801
00:36:50,062 --> 00:36:51,8
Look, you're going to be fine.

802
00:36:52,058 --> 00:36:55,3
-You have nothing to worry about.
-Except an ex-boyfriend with a bomb.

803
00:36:56,046 --> 00:36:59,8
Hearing me on a walkie-talkie isn't
going to be enough. I need to go in there.

804
00:36:59,096 --> 00:37:00,8
No.

805
00:37:01,034 --> 00:37:02,5
It's way too dangerous.

806
00:37:02,084 --> 00:37:04,5
No, I know that he wants to see me.

807
00:37:05,026 --> 00:37:07,1
Those people in there,
the ones you can't lose...

808
00:37:08,085 --> 00:37:10,1
this is how we save them.

809
00:37:10,026 --> 00:37:13,6
[sirens wailing]

810
00:37:13,073 --> 00:37:15,7
[pacing footsteps]

811
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:19,1
If they're following protocol,
the food delivery started a countdown,

812
00:37:19,019 --> 00:37:21,7
which probably means we have
about ten minutes until SWAT arrives.

813
00:37:21,098 --> 00:37:24,9
So we have to get the bomb taken care of
before that. Ella, are you good?

814
00:37:25,057 --> 00:37:26,4
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

815
00:37:27,099 --> 00:37:30,9
Eve, back her up in case anything happens.
You're...

816
00:37:31,049 --> 00:37:33,6
good at... calming her down.

817
00:37:33,075 --> 00:37:34,7
But what about--

818
00:37:34,087 --> 00:37:35,7
He's going to be fine.

819
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:37,9
We just need a distraction
to get you guys up there.

820
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,0
[Leona] Marco.

821
00:37:42,013 --> 00:37:43,8
I can't believe it.

822
00:37:45,034 --> 00:37:46,5
You're actually here.

823
00:37:48,084 --> 00:37:49,8
[Leona] I am so sorry.

824
00:37:50,081 --> 00:37:53,2
I know that all of this is my fault.
Everything...

825
00:37:53,093 --> 00:37:55,1
is my fault.

826
00:37:55,077 --> 00:37:57,3
-No.
-No, no, just let me...

827
00:37:58,052 --> 00:37:59,4
Let me say this.

828
00:38:03,015 --> 00:38:03,9
I have made...

829
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:06,2
so many mistakes.

830
00:38:08,066 --> 00:38:10,7
You didn't deserve what happened to you,
Marco.

831
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,0
I am so...

832
00:38:16,046 --> 00:38:17,2
sorry.

833
00:38:25,055 --> 00:38:26,4
[sound of metal]

834
00:38:30,034 --> 00:38:33,6
[Marco gasps]

835
00:38:34,006 --> 00:38:35,0
[thud]

836
00:38:35,018 --> 00:38:36,3
[cries of shock]

837
00:38:36,048 --> 00:38:39,4
Okay, Leona,
give me the gun and the detonator.

838
00:38:39,056 --> 00:38:40,9
It's okay. I'm a cop.

839
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:42,1
Yeah.

840
00:38:43,048 --> 00:38:44,6
You're a cop.

841
00:38:45,094 --> 00:38:48,1
And I don't know
what Marco told you, so...

842
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:50,3
I can't take any chances.

843
00:38:56,066 --> 00:38:58,3
[Leona] Everybody, get in the corner.

844
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,8
Hurry.

845
00:39:00,075 --> 00:39:01,7
Move!

846
00:39:01,092 --> 00:39:08,4
[Lucifer gasping]

847
00:39:08,055 --> 00:39:11,7
[panting]

848
00:39:11,089 --> 00:39:14,1
Doesn't feel so great, does it?

849
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,9
[Lucifer giggles]

850
00:39:18,085 --> 00:39:19,6
[click]

851
00:39:23,065 --> 00:39:25,0
What's going on? The wife came in?

852
00:39:25,015 --> 00:39:27,4
So is it all good?
Maybe I don't have to do this anymore.

853
00:39:27,074 --> 00:39:29,0
Yeah, actually...

854
00:39:29,065 --> 00:39:30,9
you might want to hurry up.

855
00:39:34,008 --> 00:39:36,1
-[Marco coughs]
-[Leona] Is he still alive?

856
00:39:36,087 --> 00:39:39,3
Yeah, he always was tougher
than he was smart.

857
00:39:40,025 --> 00:39:41,6
You were involved in the robbery.

858
00:39:42,008 --> 00:39:45,3
I wasn't involved in the robbery.
I masterminded it.

859
00:39:45,096 --> 00:39:49,0
This idiot and his army bros
couldn't plan a trip to the beach.

860
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:53,0
So Marco never wanted us to find you
so he could apologize. He wanted to...

861
00:39:54,005 --> 00:39:55,3
take out his final partner.

862
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:56,7
Yeah.

863
00:39:57,026 --> 00:39:58,9
It was a pretty good trap.

864
00:39:59,027 --> 00:40:00,8
Force the police to find me.

865
00:40:01,006 --> 00:40:05,1
If I don't show, he blows my cover
and, if I do, well...

866
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,2
[laughs]

867
00:40:07,053 --> 00:40:10,1
I mean, that was the plan,
wasn't it, Marco?

868
00:40:10,095 --> 00:40:13,6
You weren't expecting me
to play on your emotions, were you?

869
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,9
You always were such a softie.
[Marco yells]

870
00:40:17,049 --> 00:40:18,4
[Chloe] What now?

871
00:40:18,099 --> 00:40:22,4
You go outside and tell them
Marco apologized and let you go.

872
00:40:23,058 --> 00:40:26,3
[Chloe] Then what? The place explodes
and it's all Marco's fault?

873
00:40:26,075 --> 00:40:28,2
Sounds like a pretty solid plan to me.

874
00:40:28,088 --> 00:40:31,3
[Ella, breathing hard]

875
00:40:31,038 --> 00:40:33,7
I don't want to freak you out,
but we're kind of out of time.

876
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,8
Like, right now.

877
00:40:34,093 --> 00:40:36,7
Okay, this is not like the diagram online.

878
00:40:39,043 --> 00:40:40,9
Okay. Big guy...

879
00:40:41,085 --> 00:40:43,9
I know it's been a while, but...

880
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:46,6
I'm going to really need a sign here.

881
00:40:47,006 --> 00:40:49,4
[Chloe] You don't need to do this, Leona.

882
00:40:49,048 --> 00:40:50,4
Sorry.

883
00:40:51,003 --> 00:40:53,0
I have worked too hard to go to jail now.

884
00:40:53,053 --> 00:40:54,7
After rebuilding my life.

885
00:40:55,061 --> 00:40:57,8
Do you know what kind of ordnance
Marco used?

886
00:40:58,008 --> 00:40:59,6
How far away you need to be...

887
00:41:00,033 --> 00:41:01,7
before you hit the detonator?

888
00:41:02,041 --> 00:41:05,0
What are you going to do with that thing
after you hit the button?

889
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:06,4
Nice try.

890
00:41:06,058 --> 00:41:08,7
You're not getting in my head that easily.

891
00:41:08,084 --> 00:41:10,5
You're not going to talk me down.

892
00:41:10,084 --> 00:41:12,9
[quietly] I'm not trying to talk you down.

893
00:41:15,047 --> 00:41:17,8
I'm trying to get you
to the southwest corner.

894
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:19,2
[electric whistle]

895
00:41:19,031 --> 00:41:21,3

902
00:41:47,037 --> 00:41:49,8
[LAPD men shouting]

903
00:41:49,096 --> 00:41:51,3
[shouting]

904
00:41:51,046 --> 00:41:52,5
[Ella sighs]

905
00:41:52,071 --> 00:41:53,8
That was a rush.

906
00:41:54,034 --> 00:41:56,1
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

907
00:41:56,051 --> 00:41:59,1
-You did it. You did it!
-Are you alive? Am I alive?

908
00:41:59,047 --> 00:42:00,4
Oh, my God!

909
00:42:01,031 --> 00:42:04,3
-[coughing]
-[chatter]

910
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:06,0
[Chloe sighs]

911
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:08,8
Are you okay?

912
00:42:09,044 --> 00:42:11,1
You landed on my bullet wound.

913
00:42:11,082 --> 00:42:15,7
That's exactly the jolt of blinding pain
I needed to bring me round.

914
00:42:16,074 --> 00:42:17,6
I'm sorry.

915
00:42:17,091 --> 00:42:19,4
No, detective.

916
00:42:19,099 --> 00:42:21,2
[breathes shakily]

917
00:42:21,028 --> 00:42:22,9
You threw yourself onto me.

918
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:25,0
[breathes shakily]

919
00:42:25,008 --> 00:42:28,8
You were willing to sacrifice yourself
to save me.

920
00:42:32,059 --> 00:42:34,5
Ha. Ah.

921
00:42:37,038 --> 00:42:38,9
Medic. Medic!

922
00:42:41,076 --> 00:42:42,6
One second.

923
00:42:46,014 --> 00:42:47,1
Detective.

924
00:42:48,006 --> 00:42:49,0
Fancy seeing you here.

925
00:42:50,044 --> 00:42:51,4
How are you feeling?

926
00:42:51,094 --> 00:42:54,9
I started feeling better
the moment I got out on the street.

927
00:42:55,011 --> 00:42:56,0
Funny that.

928
00:42:56,086 --> 00:42:59,4
Also, I have an excellent nurse.

929
00:43:02,007 --> 00:43:03,4
I'll give you two a moment.

930
00:43:05,074 --> 00:43:06,7
[Chloe] Thanks.

931
00:43:09,046 --> 00:43:11,4
So anyhow, I just...

932
00:43:14,017 --> 00:43:16,1
I wanted to make sure you were okay.

933
00:43:17,017 --> 00:43:19,9
And, about this being your last case...

934
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:21,9
[sighs emotionally]

935
00:43:22,001 --> 00:43:23,9
well, I just wanted you to know that...

936
00:43:25,047 --> 00:43:27,1
I understand how you're feeling.

937
00:43:28,014 --> 00:43:31,7
And now I understand
how you feel as well, detective.

938
00:43:32,073 --> 00:43:35,7
And, for what it's worth,
I think I've got my closure.

939
00:43:36,036 --> 00:43:37,1
Good.

940
00:43:39,028 --> 00:43:40,2
For our next case,

941
00:43:40,028 --> 00:43:42,9
try not to bring a trigger-happy murderer
to one of my parties.

942
00:43:42,099 --> 00:43:44,1
It kills the buzz.

943
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,2
You still want to be partners?

944
00:43:49,033 --> 00:43:50,3
You know me, detective.

945
00:43:51,017 --> 00:43:52,9
I go off and do something dramatic

946
00:43:53,004 --> 00:43:55,3
and then I realize
I'm right where I'm supposed to be.

947
00:43:57,025 --> 00:43:58,1
Ah.

948
00:44:04,018 --> 00:44:05,5
This is all on me.

949
00:44:07,064 --> 00:44:09,4
I should have realized
what she intended to do.

950
00:44:09,073 --> 00:44:11,4
No, you should have let me go in there.

951
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:14,9
Marco wouldn't be in an ambulance.
The woman was an amateur.

952
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:16,3
It was right there.

953
00:44:16,098 --> 00:44:18,9
The connections she had for the fake ID.

954
00:44:19,065 --> 00:44:21,7
Insisting I let her go inside to face him.

955
00:44:21,086 --> 00:44:24,7
Like I said Dan,
you have to think like a criminal.

956
00:44:25,087 --> 00:44:29,0
And remember the woman
who actually knows how to use her knife.

957
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:31,9
[Ella] Dan! Dan.

958
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,1
Don't beat yourself up, okay?

959
00:44:33,025 --> 00:44:36,4
You can't get inside the head
of every psycho. Look, it all worked out.

960
00:44:36,063 --> 00:44:39,4
-Thank God you were in there, Ella.
-That is just it.

961
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,6
I was in there.

962
00:44:40,071 --> 00:44:42,9
I was in there.
I was right in the middle of it.

963
00:44:43,043 --> 00:44:46,1
And I asked him for a sign

964
00:44:46,039 --> 00:44:50,0
and that's when I realized,
Dan, I wasn't going to get one.

965
00:44:50,043 --> 00:44:54,5
I wasn't going to get one
because I had to count on myself,

966
00:44:54,085 --> 00:44:55,7
because...

967
00:44:56,002 --> 00:44:59,1
God doesn't exist!

968
00:44:59,019 --> 00:45:01,1
-Are you on drugs?
-A little ecstasy.

969
00:45:01,028 --> 00:45:02,7
And some cocaine.

970
00:45:03,024 --> 00:45:06,1
-What?
-Oh, my God, you smell amazing.

971
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:07,2
Come here.

972
00:45:08,058 --> 00:45:09,4
[tapping]

973
00:45:09,099 --> 00:45:10,9
[door clicks]

974
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,7
Amenadiel, hey.

975
00:45:12,096 --> 00:45:13,8
Chloe.

976
00:45:14,083 --> 00:45:17,2
Uh, you wanted to see me?

977
00:45:17,092 --> 00:45:18,7
Yeah.

978
00:45:19,034 --> 00:45:20,8
Yeah, I did. I...

979
00:45:21,021 --> 00:45:24,0
I know we haven't had a chance to talk
since I...

980
00:45:24,068 --> 00:45:25,5
found out...

981
00:45:26,043 --> 00:45:28,6
-well, everything.
-Yeah.

982
00:45:29,018 --> 00:45:30,1
That I'm an angel.

983
00:45:30,031 --> 00:45:31,1
[laughs]

984
00:45:31,056 --> 00:45:32,3
How are you?

985
00:45:33,002 --> 00:45:34,8
I mean, it is a lot to process.

986
00:45:34,098 --> 00:45:35,8
Yeah.

987
00:45:36,015 --> 00:45:37,9
It is, it is.

988
00:45:38,006 --> 00:45:42,2
But I didn't know who else to talk to
about this.

989
00:45:42,082 --> 00:45:45,9
Right? My job is to read people, to...

990
00:45:46,074 --> 00:45:51,1
understand their motives,
to make sense of the world.

991
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:53,6
And, right now, my world is...

992
00:45:54,029 --> 00:45:55,4
celestials and...

993
00:45:56,008 --> 00:45:57,8
immortals and...

994
00:45:59,004 --> 00:46:00,9
Okay, look. Is Eve...

995
00:46:01,071 --> 00:46:02,8
okay?

996
00:46:03,034 --> 00:46:04,2
Is Eve...

997
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,5
secretly evil or...

998
00:46:07,022 --> 00:46:09,8
some supernatural threat to the world?

999
00:46:10,047 --> 00:46:12,3
Not that I know of, no.

1000
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,2
Okay, good.

1001
00:46:14,031 --> 00:46:15,5
I thought so.

1002
00:46:16,035 --> 00:46:17,9
Because, you know, I like her.

1003
00:46:18,077 --> 00:46:19,7
I do too.

1004
00:46:19,086 --> 00:46:22,6
Yeah, and I think she genuinely...

1005
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,1
cares deeply about Lucifer.

1006
00:46:26,003 --> 00:46:29,4
And she is so protective over him.

1007
00:46:30,003 --> 00:46:32,7
I practically had to force her
to leave his side and...

1008
00:46:34,095 --> 00:46:36,4
I think she might be good for him.

1009
00:46:37,058 --> 00:46:40,3
I think she might be
exactly what he needs.

1010
00:46:41,034 --> 00:46:42,5
I hope that's the case.

1011
00:46:43,034 --> 00:46:44,3
Yeah, me too.

1012
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:50,1
After all that you've been through,
Chloe...

1013
00:46:51,085 --> 00:46:55,9
what you're worried about most is
what's best for those that you care about.

1014
00:46:58,031 --> 00:47:00,7
No wonder your dad is so proud of you.

1015
00:47:02,094 --> 00:47:05,9
Oh, that's sweet,
but, you know, my dad, he...

1016
00:47:07,015 --> 00:47:08,2
He...

1017
00:47:11,082 --> 00:47:12,8
Oh!

1018
00:47:14,054 --> 00:47:15,7
[chuckles]

1019
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:17,1
Right.

1020
00:47:19,025 --> 00:47:20,1
Thank you.

1021
00:47:22,096 --> 00:47:25,5
["Good As Gold" by Moon Taxi playing]

1022
00:47:35,031 --> 00:47:37,6
You know, I'm really happy
you're going back to work.

1023
00:47:38,052 --> 00:47:42,5
Adam's idea of paradise
was laying around all day doing nothing.

1024
00:47:43,036 --> 00:47:45,4
Once we got ESPN up there, forget it.

1025
00:47:45,057 --> 00:47:47,6
Well, sadly
there'll be a lot less lying around here

1026
00:47:47,078 --> 00:47:49,7
now that I'm back to catching killers.

1027
00:47:50,045 --> 00:47:54,4
But there are certain perks to having
a boyfriend who works with the LAPD.

1028
00:47:55,033 --> 00:47:57,3
An endless supply of handcuffs, for one.

1029
00:47:58,054 --> 00:47:59,7
Boyfriend?

1030
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:00,8
Well, I...

1031
00:48:01,025 --> 00:48:04,0
once someone tends to you
when you're bleeding to death,

1032
00:48:04,017 --> 00:48:06,0
it's only good manners
to make it official.

1033
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:15,3
So...

1034
00:48:16,005 --> 00:48:17,3
we're really doing this?

1035
00:48:18,002 --> 00:48:20,6
I'll finish making your drink
and we'll toast to it.

1036
00:48:21,056 --> 00:48:23,1
-Ooh!
-Careful!

1037
00:48:25,015 --> 00:48:25,9
You're fine.

1038
00:48:29,015 --> 00:48:31,7
What is it with you
only getting injured sometimes?

1039
00:48:31,095 --> 00:48:34,0
Oh, I'm only vulnerable
when the detective's around.

1040
00:48:34,032 --> 00:48:35,2
What?

1041
00:48:35,066 --> 00:48:36,4
Oh...

1042
00:48:37,028 --> 00:48:41,2
I totally forgot.
My snake costume finally arrived.

1043
00:48:41,096 --> 00:48:43,5
You are going to love this.
