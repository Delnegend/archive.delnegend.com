00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:27,2
No. Actually, he and I
aren't working together anymore.

-What? For real?
-Yep.

You know,
I don't really want to talk about it.

8
00:00:34,053 --> 00:00:35,3
Okay.

You're okay though, right?

10

Totally. Totally fine.

11

You know, I was fine before Lucifer,
I'll be fine after.

It's really for the best.

hotshot jewelry designer
from Beverly Hills,

17
00:00:50,005 --> 00:00:52,5
-just back from the Middle East.
-[Ella] Cause of death, pretty obvi.

18
00:00:52,063 --> 00:00:54,2
Manual strangulation.

19
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,0
Not a fun way to go.

20
00:00:56,072 --> 00:00:58,0
Unless it's your thing.

21
00:00:58,018 --> 00:01:00,1
Ella found pistachio shells
under the body.

22
00:01:00,022 --> 00:01:02,7
So weird, because there's
no pistachios anywhere on the plane.

23

But the cabin's full of other great stuff.

from the evidence

No.

30
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,6

to be working with us anymore.

Yeah, we built it together, ground up.

-Not yet.
-What necklace?

Pablo was transporting our latest piece,
The Desert Mirage.

40
00:01:40,072 --> 00:01:44,0
It's a $3 million original
he finished in Dubai.

41
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,1
Why Dubai?

42
00:01:45,023 --> 00:01:47,5
It's where we get our best deals,
buying gold and diamonds.

43
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,9
And you were here to pick him up?

44
00:01:48,098 --> 00:01:52,9
No. My assistant and I were prepping
for an investors' meeting

45
00:01:53,002 --> 00:01:56,5
and I didn't hear his voicemail
until after we were finished.

46
00:01:56,061 --> 00:01:58,1
I come racing down here and...

47
00:01:58,082 --> 00:02:00,4
You know, I find him like this.

Hey, Toby. It's Pablo.

50
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:09,0
I messed up, man. I'm in some serious debt
with these dangerous dudes

51
00:02:09,012 --> 00:02:11,0

to give them the Mirage.

Do you know who Pablo
was referring to there?

57

I didn't even know
he was in any kind of trouble until this.

58
00:02:24,014 --> 00:02:25,9
Well, do you know anyone
who speaks Arabic?

59
00:02:26,031 --> 00:02:28,1
A lot of our business associates.

60
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,0
Really? Great.
Okay, we'll need a list of those people.

61
00:02:31,094 --> 00:02:35,1
Maybe Pablo's dangerous dudes killed him
because he didn't get their payment.

62
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:38,9
Wait, pistachios. There's a thug that
I heard of, eats those things obsessively.

63
00:02:39,007 --> 00:02:41,3
The dude definitely qualifies
as dangerous.

64
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:42,8
And guess what his first language is?

65
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:43,9

00:09:26,056 --> 00:09:29,4
Tell me where the necklace is
or I'll shoot your friend in the face.

190
00:09:29,048 --> 00:09:31,4
-There's no need to be so rude.
-[bang]

191
00:09:31,057 --> 00:09:33,8
[screams] Lucifer! Oh, my God!

192
00:09:33,094 --> 00:09:35,4
[Eve screams]

193
00:09:35,057 --> 00:09:36,4
Help!

194
00:09:36,057 --> 00:09:38,0
Oh, my God. Help!

195
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,2
[Lucifer gasps]

196
00:09:41,028 --> 00:09:42,7
-Oh, my...
-[gasps]

197
00:09:43,004 --> 00:09:44,0
You're okay?

198
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:47,1
Well, I may need another drink
and a bottle of ibuprofen,

199
00:09:47,025 --> 00:09:48,7
but, yes, I'll survive.

200
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,0
[Eve] Oh, my God.

201
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:54,7
But I would love an explanation from you,
Eve.

202
00:10:04,077 --> 00:10:05,7
So...

203
00:10:07,094 --> 00:10:09,6
Who the hell was that, mm?

204
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:13,1
It's not every day
I get shot in the face over some necklace.

205
00:10:13,044 --> 00:10:16,7
[Eve]
I have no idea who that scary driver was.

206
00:10:17,045 --> 00:10:19,4
The only necklace I can think of is...

207
00:10:20,003 --> 00:10:20,8
Pablo's.

208
00:10:20,095 --> 00:10:22,5
And Pablo is?

209
00:10:22,066 --> 00:10:24,9
The guy who gave me a ride here
on his jet.

210
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:29,9
On the way over, he kept showing off
this really expensive necklace he made.

211
00:10:30,025 --> 00:10:34,5
Said it was for some Arab guy
with a weird name.

212
00:10:34,075 --> 00:10:35,7
Byron?

213
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,2
Buster?

214
00:10:38,034 --> 00:10:39,4
Doesn't sound very Arab.

215
00:10:39,051 --> 00:10:40,4
Bashir?

216
00:10:40,051 --> 00:10:42,8
Not Bashir Al-Fassad?

217
00:10:42,097 --> 00:10:45,1
Yes, that's it! You know him?

218
00:10:45,026 --> 00:10:48,3
Yes. He calls himself
the concierge of crime.

219
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,1
If Bashir thinks
you've taken something from him,

220
00:10:51,023 --> 00:10:53,1
then he'll stop at nothing to get it back.

221
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,0
But I don't have his necklace.

222
00:10:55,015 --> 00:10:58,2
Well, then I suppose
we should pay Bashir a visit,

223
00:10:58,036 --> 00:10:59,9
sort this whole mess out, yes?

224
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,2
[nurse] And how have we been feeling?

225
00:11:06,037 --> 00:11:10,0
Great actually.
Tons of energy, sleeping well.

226
00:11:10,012 --> 00:11:14,0
Not to mention
I have a truly supernatural support team.

227
00:11:18,042 --> 00:11:20,3
Okay, ready to see your baby--
[gasps]

228
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:23,4
Maze! Maze.

229
00:11:23,051 --> 00:11:26,3
It's just ultrasound gel.

230
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,4
-Continue.
-Good.

231
00:11:36,023 --> 00:11:37,1
[Amenadiel mumbles]

232
00:11:37,094 --> 00:11:39,3
It's okay.

233
00:11:43,061 --> 00:11:44,4
[nurse] Okay.

234
00:11:46,012 --> 00:11:50,0
Okay, do you see
that little protrusion right there?

235
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:52,0
You're having a boy.

236
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:53,0
A boy?

237
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,0
Better luck next time.

238
00:11:56,034 --> 00:11:59,8
Do you see a second protrusion anywhere?
Maybe even a third?

239
00:12:00,063 --> 00:12:03,1
Typically, there's only one penis.

240
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,4
Nah. I was looking for the wings.

241
00:12:06,051 --> 00:12:07,5
The wings?

242
00:12:07,076 --> 00:12:10,7
[laughing] You know what?

243
00:12:10,081 --> 00:12:14,7
I guess, at some point, we all like
to think of our babies as little angels.

244
00:12:14,085 --> 00:12:15,8
[nurse] Oh, yes!

245
00:12:15,094 --> 00:12:17,3
[both laugh]

246
00:12:17,073 --> 00:12:18,9
Wait, wings?

247
00:12:22,045 --> 00:12:23,9
See? Isn't this nice?

248
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:27,4
Just a couple of sensible,
law-abiding detectives on a case.

249
00:12:27,066 --> 00:12:30,5
No hidden flasks, no random drug use.

250
00:12:30,087 --> 00:12:32,3
No crazy shenanigans.

251
00:12:32,096 --> 00:12:36,1
You don't have to convince me
that life's better without Lucifer.

252
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,4
[man] Detectives.

253
00:12:42,051 --> 00:12:43,4
Welcome.

254
00:12:44,043 --> 00:12:45,6
Can I get you a mojito?

255
00:12:45,072 --> 00:12:47,5
Pete, get the detectives a mojito.

256
00:12:48,005 --> 00:12:50,5
No, we're not here to drink,
Mr. Al-Fassad.

257
00:12:50,064 --> 00:12:52,0
We're here about Pablo Silva.

258
00:12:52,014 --> 00:12:53,1
Mm.

259
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:55,8
I'm afraid you're out of luck.
We don't know any Pablo.

260
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:58,8
So you didn't go to Mr. Silva's hangar
and strangle him to death?

261
00:12:59,015 --> 00:13:00,2
[Bashir] Pablo's dead?

262
00:13:00,036 --> 00:13:01,5
He was alive when we left him.

263
00:13:02,036 --> 00:13:04,1
Oh, and when was that?

264
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:05,4
Um...

265
00:13:06,003 --> 00:13:07,2
A long time ago.

266
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:10,2
So, you see,
it appears we cannot help you.

267
00:13:10,028 --> 00:13:11,2
So very sorry.

268
00:13:11,058 --> 00:13:15,0
Well, if you can't help us,
then maybe Turkish Pete here can.

269
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:18,4
Maybe a DNA test on these shells
will place you at the crime scene.

270
00:13:18,054 --> 00:13:19,3
Dan.

271
00:13:19,046 --> 00:13:20,4
-Hmm?
-Dan.

272
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,5
I wanted you here
because you're not like Lucifer, okay?

273
00:13:26,063 --> 00:13:28,9
-So can you please relax?
-Did you say, "Lucifer"?

274
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,0
-Lucifer Morningstar?
-Uh-huh.

275
00:13:32,052 --> 00:13:33,8
I love that guy.

276
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,7
Are you that partner of his
he's always gushing about?

277
00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:39,0
Er... yeah.

278
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,5
[Bashir laughs] Fabulous.

279
00:13:42,023 --> 00:13:44,1
So, where is he?

280
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:45,4
[groans]

281
00:13:45,082 --> 00:13:47,3
[Chloe] Erm. He's home.

282
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,1
Sick.

283
00:13:50,099 --> 00:13:54,5
Erm, as I recall,
don't you owe him a favor?

284
00:13:55,025 --> 00:13:56,7
He told you about that, did he?

285
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,7
Yeah, he did.

286
00:13:58,029 --> 00:14:02,8
And you're in luck, because he said I
could collect on your debt in his absence.

287
00:14:03,013 --> 00:14:04,8
You know, square you away for good.

288
00:14:04,092 --> 00:14:05,7
Well..

289
00:14:06,005 --> 00:14:07,2
As Lucifer would say...

290
00:14:08,009 --> 00:14:09,2
what is it you desire?

291
00:14:09,097 --> 00:14:10,8
The truth.

292
00:14:11,047 --> 00:14:12,4
Alright then.

293
00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:13,7
Yes.

294
00:14:14,022 --> 00:14:15,2
I know Pablo.

295
00:14:16,002 --> 00:14:19,8
I, shall we say, connect him
with the things that he desires.

296
00:14:20,044 --> 00:14:23,5
Exotic women, exotic drugs etc., etc.

297
00:14:24,044 --> 00:14:25,7
He racked up quite a tab.

298
00:14:26,007 --> 00:14:27,3
But we worked out a deal.

299
00:14:27,044 --> 00:14:30,4
Debt forgiven in exchange
for a one-of-a-kind piece of jewelry.

300
00:14:30,057 --> 00:14:32,0
-The Desert Mirage.
-Bingo.

301
00:14:32,016 --> 00:14:34,7
But Pablo managed to lose it
before we had a chance to get it back.

302
00:14:34,087 --> 00:14:35,8
So you killed him.

303
00:14:35,095 --> 00:14:37,8
[laughs] This guy.

304
00:14:37,091 --> 00:14:40,5
Why would I kill a man
who owes me millions? No, no.

305
00:14:40,067 --> 00:14:43,5
We roughed him up a bit, told him
he'd better find it before we did

306
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:46,0
and then we left him in the hangar.
Very much alive.

307
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,4
Mm-hmm. Do you have an alibi for all that?

308
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:51,5
We made a long stop
at the grocery store on the way home.

309
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,0
Refilled my pistachios.

310
00:14:54,014 --> 00:14:56,9
I'm sure the store's security cameras
can verify that.

311
00:14:57,006 --> 00:14:58,8
Oh, there's something else
I want to show you.

312
00:14:59,077 --> 00:15:01,6
To prove my claim on the necklace.

313
00:15:03,048 --> 00:15:06,0
Pablo sent this on the way over.

314
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:10,0
Bashir!

315
00:15:10,053 --> 00:15:15,3
Hey, bud. Be there in no time.
Your necklace is in safe hands.

316
00:15:15,095 --> 00:15:17,1
Hers!

317
00:15:17,024 --> 00:15:18,4
[Dan] Who are these women?

318
00:15:19,004 --> 00:15:22,0
[Bashir] Don't know. But find them
and you'll probably find my necklace.

319
00:15:22,017 --> 00:15:24,2
-And Pablo's killer.
-[Bashir] Mm!

320
00:15:24,084 --> 00:15:26,6
Feels good to finally repay Lucifer.

321
00:15:27,025 --> 00:15:29,0
Good thing you two are partners, huh?

322
00:15:29,076 --> 00:15:31,5
[Eve] This is so exciting!

323
00:15:31,059 --> 00:15:35,1
Oh, wow.
You against a dangerous crime lord.

324
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,6
What are you going to do to him?

325
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:40,6
Ooh, are you going to toss him in the
pool? No, are you going to break his arm?

326
00:15:40,068 --> 00:15:42,5
Or, you know, bash him in the balls?

327
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,0
Ah, I always wanted to try that.

328
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:47,1
No-one will be bashing anyone in the
balls. A simple conversation will suffice.

329
00:15:47,027 --> 00:15:50,2
[Dan] I never thought I would say
this, but Lucifer actually came in handy.

330
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,4
What are we doing?
Not that I'm complaining.

331
00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:53,3
Shh.

332
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,6
[Dan] There's no way you knew
Bashir owed Lucifer a favor.

333
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,7
[Eve] Who are those two?

334
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,8
[Chloe] A total gamble.

335
00:15:58,016 --> 00:15:59,1
The police.

336
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:03,3
And I would prefer to avoid her...
them... at any cost.

337
00:16:03,042 --> 00:16:05,4
[car doors slam, engine starts]

338
00:16:08,071 --> 00:16:11,2
[Bashir] Lucifer! So good to see you.

339
00:16:11,084 --> 00:16:13,7
You just missed the lovely detective.

340
00:16:14,022 --> 00:16:15,6
She said you were home sick.

341
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,2
Yes, well, I'm up and about now.

342
00:16:17,072 --> 00:16:19,1
What, may I ask, was she here for?

343
00:16:19,085 --> 00:16:23,8
Enquiring about the murder
of a client of mine. RIP, Pablo Silva.

344
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:25,6
Can I get you a mojito?

345
00:16:25,069 --> 00:16:27,4
You didn't mention this man was murdered.

346
00:16:27,048 --> 00:16:29,6
-Did you have anything to do with this?
-Of course not.

347
00:16:30,015 --> 00:16:33,3
This is the first I'm hearing of this.
Poor Pablo.

348
00:16:34,061 --> 00:16:36,4
Uncle, I added more mint this time.

349
00:16:37,049 --> 00:16:38,3
What the...

350
00:16:39,012 --> 00:16:40,1
I shot you in the face!

351
00:16:40,024 --> 00:16:41,9
Yes, and I gave you a terrible rating.

352
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,1
George! What have I told you?

353
00:16:44,033 --> 00:16:46,2
No more shooting without my permission.

354
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:48,2
I was trying to get your necklace back.

355
00:16:48,038 --> 00:16:49,8
And this lady was--

356
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:51,1
Wait a second.

357
00:16:52,017 --> 00:16:53,5
You're that woman from the plane.

358
00:16:53,067 --> 00:16:55,8
-That's why we're here, Bashir.
-Yes.

359
00:16:56,043 --> 00:16:57,5
I don't have your necklace.

360
00:16:57,064 --> 00:17:00,8
So how about you leave her be
and we'll consider your debt to me paid.

361
00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:02,4
A little too late, my friend.

362
00:17:02,098 --> 00:17:06,0
Your partner collected your favor
in exchange for some info.

363
00:17:08,019 --> 00:17:09,3
Clever detective.

364
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,2
Fine.

365
00:17:12,019 --> 00:17:13,0
Partner?

366
00:17:13,015 --> 00:17:14,7
[Lucifer]
Why not have a new arrangement?

367
00:17:14,082 --> 00:17:16,5
How about I just pay you for the necklace?

368
00:17:16,091 --> 00:17:18,0
Sorry, but no.

369
00:17:18,016 --> 00:17:19,1
I don't want money.

370
00:17:19,028 --> 00:17:22,4
I want the Desert Mirage.
It was supposed to be a gift for my wife.

371
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,2
Mira, she will accept no substitutes.

372
00:17:25,066 --> 00:17:27,2
The things we do for our women, right?

373
00:17:28,004 --> 00:17:30,9
What? Her? No, no.
We're not together together.

374
00:17:31,005 --> 00:17:32,3
But we used to be.

375
00:17:32,046 --> 00:17:34,9
Maybe you've read about it
in a little book called The Bible.

376
00:17:35,047 --> 00:17:36,3
Read about what?

377
00:17:36,047 --> 00:17:38,6
You know, the garden, the snake,
the apple.

378
00:17:38,072 --> 00:17:40,2
The metaphors were a bit off.

379
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:44,3
That's true. The forbidden fruit was less
of an apple and more like a banana.

380
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:47,4
-A very large banana.
-It's true.

381
00:17:47,056 --> 00:17:49,0
You never forget your first.

382
00:17:52,015 --> 00:17:54,7
I have no idea
what you two are talking about.

383
00:17:55,086 --> 00:17:57,9
Right. No, of course. Er, ooh!

384
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,9
Erm, look, why don't we
just strike a new deal? [clap]

385
00:18:01,045 --> 00:18:05,0
You and your goons agree to leave
this young lady alone, unharmed,

386
00:18:05,008 --> 00:18:06,7
whilst I attempt
to retrieve your necklace?

387
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,6
Deal.

388
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:09,9
Less work for me anyway.

389
00:18:10,004 --> 00:18:12,8
-[Eve claps]
-Excellent. Once it's back in your hands,

390
00:18:12,096 --> 00:18:15,3
we'll call it even
and everyone can go their separate ways.

391
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:22,9

393
00:18:30,002 --> 00:18:31,2
Can you believe it?

394
00:18:31,094 --> 00:18:32,9
A son.

395
00:18:34,023 --> 00:18:36,6
There's so many things
I can't wait to teach him.

396
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,5
I mean, how to fight, obviously.

397
00:18:39,086 --> 00:18:40,9
How to fly.

398
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,7
[laughs]

399
00:18:42,078 --> 00:18:45,8
My very own mini Amenadiel.
No, no, wait, wait.

400
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,8
A-mini-diel.

401
00:18:48,054 --> 00:18:50,7
Baby warrior angel. Ha!

[ceiling fan throbbing]

403
00:18:52,088 --> 00:18:53,8
Linda?

404
00:18:54,034 --> 00:18:56,7
[noise intensifies]

405
00:18:56,084 --> 00:18:57,6
Nope.

406
00:18:58,055 --> 00:19:00,4
-Nope, can't do it.
-Do what?

407
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:04,8
My house is not prepared
for a flying baby.

408
00:19:05,006 --> 00:19:09,6
Other parents put up baby gates
and cover up power outlets.

409
00:19:10,044 --> 00:19:11,8
What are we supposed to do?

410
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:13,6
Baby proof the ceiling?

411
00:19:13,081 --> 00:19:15,1
You know, that's a good idea.

412
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:16,9
Amenadiel, how are we supposed to do this?

413
00:19:17,003 --> 00:19:20,2
How are we supposed
to keep an angel baby safe?

414
00:19:20,032 --> 00:19:22,3
I don't know. I've never seen one before.
No-one has.

415
00:19:22,066 --> 00:19:23,6
You're joking.

416
00:19:23,074 --> 00:19:25,4
You see, angels, we didn't grow up.

417
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:27,5
We just appeared fully formed.

418
00:19:27,062 --> 00:19:29,2
That's how Mom and Dad created us.

419
00:19:29,066 --> 00:19:32,5
So what you're telling me
is that what's happening to me,

420
00:19:32,067 --> 00:19:36,0
what's growing inside my body...

421
00:19:36,084 --> 00:19:37,7
is a first...

422
00:19:39,009 --> 00:19:40,7
in all of human history?

423
00:19:41,001 --> 00:19:43,3
All of angel history, too.

424
00:19:44,009 --> 00:19:45,1
Isn't this exciting?

425
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:46,0
No!

426
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,3
No, it's not exciting, Amenadiel.

427
00:19:48,093 --> 00:19:50,1
It's terrifying.

428
00:19:50,018 --> 00:19:51,8
Linda, it's going to be okay.

429
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:54,1
I'll come over anytime that you need help.

430
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:55,1
I appreciate that,

431
00:19:55,023 --> 00:19:57,9
but how can you say
everything's going to be fine when...

432
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,5
none of us know what to expect?

433
00:20:06,053 --> 00:20:09,3
So do you have any idea where it could be?

434
00:20:09,045 --> 00:20:12,2
You seem extremely motivated
to find this necklace.

435
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:15,2
Does this have anything to do with your...

436
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,2
-partner?
-No.

437
00:20:17,063 --> 00:20:19,7
And former partner, just to be clear.

438
00:20:20,034 --> 00:20:23,1
You know,
you really don't have to do this for me.

439
00:20:23,068 --> 00:20:25,8
Nonsense. I'd never hang you out to dry.

440
00:20:26,093 --> 00:20:29,3
Not with dangerous men like Bashir
after you.

441
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:33,6
So, uh, necklace... [claps]

442
00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:38,1
Was there anyone else on Pablo's jet?
Anyone who could have stolen it?

443
00:20:38,094 --> 00:20:40,2
There was actually.

444
00:20:40,094 --> 00:20:45,1
A real party girl named Odessa something.

445
00:20:45,024 --> 00:20:46,6
What do you know about her?

446
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,9
[Eve] Not much.

447
00:20:48,003 --> 00:20:51,5
She seemed
to really enjoy giggling and, uh,

448
00:20:52,025 --> 00:20:53,9
flirting and...

449
00:20:55,042 --> 00:20:56,5
come to think of it...

450
00:20:57,025 --> 00:20:59,1
trying on expensive jewelry.

451
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,9
She said she had this friend named Dalton.

452
00:21:03,001 --> 00:21:05,3
She kept mentioning
spending time at his place.

453
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,8
Dalton's Place?

454
00:21:07,047 --> 00:21:09,3
That's not her friend. That's a bar.

455
00:21:10,043 --> 00:21:11,8
It's a good place to start.

456
00:21:13,031 --> 00:21:14,2
[Lucifer] Come on!

457
00:21:17,073 --> 00:21:21,6
Hey, so facial recognition kicked back
zilch on the one with the white dress,

458
00:21:21,069 --> 00:21:25,1
but the woman modeling the necklace,
tons of hits.

459
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,0
-Tons?
-Yeah.

460
00:21:26,011 --> 00:21:30,1
Necklace woman is a con artist.
Usually goes by Odessa something or other.

461
00:21:30,024 --> 00:21:33,2
Her real name is Sandy Bumford.
[laughs] No wonder she changes it.

462
00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:35,8
Her MO is targeting guys in bars,
going back to their place

463
00:21:35,096 --> 00:21:38,1
and cleaning them out
before they can offer her breakfast.

464
00:21:38,025 --> 00:21:41,8
Here is a list
of Odessa's known hunting grounds in LA.

465
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:44,5
A bunch of high-end spots, some dives,
a few airport bars.

466
00:21:44,067 --> 00:21:46,7
This lady gets around.
How the hell can we find her?

467
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,8
We're going to have to canvas each
and every one of these places one by one.

00:21:57,073 --> 00:21:58,8
Real gold?

471
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:00,3
[man] Want to bite it to see?

472
00:22:00,044 --> 00:22:02,5
[lady, laughing] I trust you.

473
00:22:04,061 --> 00:22:05,9
Want to get us some drinks?

474
00:22:11,074 --> 00:22:13,2
Looking to add to your collection?

475
00:22:14,004 --> 00:22:15,9
Howdy, stranger.

476
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,9
Howdy.

477
00:22:17,091 --> 00:22:19,5
Oh, hey, it's you.

478
00:22:19,058 --> 00:22:20,9
What are you doing here?

479
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,1
We are here for the necklace.

480
00:22:23,025 --> 00:22:26,1
So hand it over and we'll let you
get back to conning this poor schmuck.

481
00:22:26,026 --> 00:22:27,2
Necklace? What necklace?

482
00:22:27,034 --> 00:22:29,2
The one you're hiding...

483
00:22:30,014 --> 00:22:31,2
in there.

484
00:22:36,031 --> 00:22:40,2
I see. You've paid off security
to help assist you with your little scam.

485
00:22:40,031 --> 00:22:41,2
Quite the entrepreneur.

486
00:22:41,056 --> 00:22:43,4
Tell me we're about to have
my first bar fight.

487
00:22:43,052 --> 00:22:45,5
I could get things started
with the ball bashing.

488
00:22:46,003 --> 00:22:47,6

Didn't know you were here.

Let's just talk about how you're involved
with Pablo's murder, okay?

551
00:26:03,089 --> 00:26:06,8
I had nothing to do with that.
I'm a grifter, not a murderer.

552
00:26:06,089 --> 00:26:09,9
I worked my way onto Pablo's jet
to steal the necklace.

-When I left, Pablo was alive.
-Where's the necklace now?

who hired me to steal it.

555
00:26:15,094 --> 00:26:16,9
An independent broker.

556
00:26:17,032 --> 00:26:18,6
-Who?
-No idea.

557
00:26:18,074 --> 00:26:24,4
But if you agree to give me immunity
for liberating that necklace...

558
00:26:25,025 --> 00:26:27,6
I can tell you where to find them.

559
00:26:28,033 --> 00:26:29,2
It's fine with me.

560
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:32,2
Alright then. Downtown tomorrow night.

561
00:26:32,029 --> 00:26:34,2
There's a black market jewelry auction,

562
00:26:34,034 --> 00:26:36,7
exclusively for the rich and shady.

563
00:26:36,092 --> 00:26:39,1
That's where they're planning
on reselling the necklace

564
00:26:39,026 --> 00:26:42,7
Now that it's Pablo's last work, I bet
the necklace will go for twice as much.

565
00:26:43,043 --> 00:26:46,6
The broker realized he could
double his payday if he killed Pablo.

566
00:26:46,068 --> 00:26:48,7
Money.
It's always a solid motive for murder.

567
00:26:48,081 --> 00:26:50,5
Right. Find the broker, find the killer.

568
00:26:51,023 --> 00:26:52,5

00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,0
Maze, hi.

570
00:27:03,012 --> 00:27:03,9
Hey.

571
00:27:07,066 --> 00:27:09,2
Have we been avoiding each other?

572
00:27:10,092 --> 00:27:12,7
Yeah. I guess we have been.

573
00:27:13,046 --> 00:27:16,9
I've just been trying to give you,
you know, space, as Linda suggested.

574
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:21,3
Trying to be understanding of the fact
that you are a backstabbing liar

575
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:25,6
who's been secretly plotting against
Lucifer and keeping me away from Trixie.

576
00:27:26,043 --> 00:27:27,6
You know what, you're right.

577
00:27:27,068 --> 00:27:29,8
But, Maze, for a second,

578
00:27:30,014 --> 00:27:33,5
can you at least try to understand
what I've been going through?

579
00:27:33,073 --> 00:27:36,5
To be the only human that knows.

580
00:27:36,086 --> 00:27:37,6
Who knows what?

581
00:27:37,078 --> 00:27:39,8
That heaven and hell...

582
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:42,2

583
00:27:43,082 --> 00:27:44,7
I get it.

584
00:27:45,062 --> 00:27:46,4
You're weak.

585
00:27:47,004 --> 00:27:48,3
You can't handle this.

586
00:27:49,066 --> 00:27:51,1
Maybe I should just move out.

587
00:28:00,026 --> 00:28:01,1
By the way...

588
00:28:02,005 --> 00:28:04,3
you're not the only human who knows.

589
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,4
Linda handled it much better than you.

590
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:12,9
[Chloe] You've known this whole time?

591
00:28:13,052 --> 00:28:16,1
Well, not the whole time, but...

592
00:28:16,082 --> 00:28:18,3
for quite a while, yes.

593
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:21,6
[Chloe] I just wish I'd have known
that you knew.

594
00:28:22,049 --> 00:28:24,5
I don't know how to deal with this, Linda.

595
00:28:25,007 --> 00:28:26,5
When I found out...

596
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,8
what Lucifer was...

597
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,7
who he truly was...

598
00:28:32,025 --> 00:28:34,5
I ran away for a month.

599
00:28:34,067 --> 00:28:37,9
An understandable reaction
in the situation.

600
00:28:38,067 --> 00:28:40,1
Have you seen his...

601
00:28:41,072 --> 00:28:42,8
face when it...

602
00:28:42,097 --> 00:28:44,2
[Linda] It was...

603
00:28:44,047 --> 00:28:46,0
It was quite alarming.

604
00:28:46,085 --> 00:28:48,4
Yeah. Yeah.

605
00:28:49,085 --> 00:28:53,6
And, Maze, how is it being friends
with her, knowing what she is?

606
00:28:54,073 --> 00:28:55,5
Well...

607
00:28:55,094 --> 00:28:57,6
it wasn't easy.

608
00:28:58,098 --> 00:29:00,0
None of it is.

609
00:29:00,053 --> 00:29:02,7
The devil, a demon...

610
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:06,0
Dating an angel. Having his baby.

611
00:29:06,066 --> 00:29:07,4
Right.

612
00:29:07,091 --> 00:29:09,2
Wait, what? You're pregnant?

613
00:29:09,028 --> 00:29:10,1
Yeah.

614
00:29:10,054 --> 00:29:12,0
With an...

615
00:29:12,087 --> 00:29:14,7
angel baby.

616
00:29:17,054 --> 00:29:18,3
Ha!

617
00:29:20,055 --> 00:29:24,0
Truth be told I'm freaking out, Chloe.
I mean, it's all just...

618
00:29:24,042 --> 00:29:25,8
It's all just hitting me...

619
00:29:26,043 --> 00:29:29,0
all at once, you know,
just how dangerous...

620
00:29:29,072 --> 00:29:32,0
How dangerous my friends are

621
00:29:32,014 --> 00:29:32,9
and how...

622
00:29:33,048 --> 00:29:38,2
How dangerous this baby inside me
might be. I mean...

623
00:29:39,015 --> 00:29:41,6
There's a good chance
it could come out with wings.

624
00:29:42,011 --> 00:29:42,9
Wings!

625
00:29:43,023 --> 00:29:45,3
Is that even safe for a human to deliver?

626
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:49,4
Should I have a C-section? Will insurance
cover any of this? I mean, who knows?

627
00:29:49,057 --> 00:29:50,6
Who knows, Chlo?

628
00:29:50,074 --> 00:29:52,9
[Chloe] Okay. Linda? Linda.

629
00:29:53,054 --> 00:29:56,0
If anyone can handle this...

630
00:29:56,054 --> 00:29:57,4
it's you.

631
00:29:57,067 --> 00:29:59,9
You're different than me. You're stronger.

632
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,7
You could have run, but you didn't.

633
00:30:03,084 --> 00:30:04,8
Why didn't you?

634
00:30:07,043 --> 00:30:10,5
I don't know. I guess...

635
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,3

636
00:30:18,031 --> 00:30:19,5

640

And this baby.

641
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:40,0
Who saw that coming?

642
00:30:40,096 --> 00:30:43,0
I guess, as freaked out as I am...

643
00:30:44,021 --> 00:30:46,4
I'm really looking forward to being a mom.

644
00:30:49,001 --> 00:30:50,2
And meeting my son.

646
00:30:58,094 --> 00:31:00,5

all comes down to is one...

00:31:10,099 --> 00:31:12,2

with your case.

656
00:31:38,073 --> 00:31:41,6
So you're the other woman
from Pablo's private jet?

657
00:31:42,056 --> 00:31:43,4
That's me.

Oh, I'm not from around here.

So let's start with...
do you know who killed Pablo?

You know, I heard someone mention
the name Bashir Al-Fassad.

00:31:54,007 --> 00:31:55,0
Does that help?

663
00:31:55,012 --> 00:31:56,7
[Chloe] Not so much.

664
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:03,2
Do you know of anyone
who would want to hurt Pablo?

665
00:32:05,034 --> 00:32:08,6
No, I really only just met him
at the airport bar,

666
00:32:08,071 --> 00:32:12,6

and that other girl onto his jet, sorry.

and very kind.

So if you have it,
I could really use your help.

743
00:35:31,033 --> 00:35:33,5
If we help you,
you'll let us leave with the necklace.

744
00:35:33,058 --> 00:35:36,0
-You know I can't promise that.
-Oh, can't you?

745
00:35:36,042 --> 00:35:38,8
Come on, Luce.
Where else do we have to be?

746
00:35:39,088 --> 00:35:40,7
It'll be fun.

747
00:35:44,026 --> 00:35:45,7
Oh, bloody hell.

748
00:35:45,085 --> 00:35:50,2
[auctioneer]
Ladies and gentlemen, item number 45005.

749
00:35:50,073 --> 00:35:53,3
Pablo Silva's Desert Mirage.

750
00:35:53,073 --> 00:35:55,4
-Starting bid, one million.
-[gasps]

751
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,8
[auctioneer] One million.

752
00:36:02,091 --> 00:36:04,3
Can I get one five?

753
00:36:04,099 --> 00:36:06,9
One five. How about two?

754
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,9
Two five?

755
00:36:12,092 --> 00:36:13,7
Three?

756
00:36:17,004 --> 00:36:17,9
Three five?

757
00:36:22,059 --> 00:36:23,8
Four?

758
00:36:27,001 --> 00:36:28,3
[auctioneer] Four!

759
00:36:28,047 --> 00:36:30,3
For crying out loud. 10 million!

760
00:36:30,077 --> 00:36:32,2
[gasps]

761
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:34,4
Going once, going twice.

762
00:36:34,056 --> 00:36:38,6
Sold for 10 million
to the dapper gentleman in the back.

763
00:36:38,069 --> 00:36:40,1
[laughing] Stop it.

764
00:36:40,028 --> 00:36:43,5
[applause]

765
00:36:45,091 --> 00:36:47,1
[Lucifer] Champagne.

766
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,8
Can't celebrate without my bubbles.

767
00:36:51,045 --> 00:36:53,5
Sir, the winning bidder's here.

768
00:36:53,087 --> 00:36:54,7
[laughs]

769
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:57,4
Turkish Pete?

770
00:36:57,050 --> 00:37:00,4
Why am I going to all this trouble
trying to find your boss's necklace

771
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:01,5
when you had it all along?

772
00:37:02,051 --> 00:37:04,4
I love working for Mr. Al-Fassad...

773
00:37:05,005 --> 00:37:06,7
but the Desert Mirage is worth millions

774
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,0
he'll just give it to his wife.

775
00:37:08,014 --> 00:37:12,0
So you Odessa to steal it from Pablo
while you and Bashir went to beat him up?

776
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:13,1
You could sell it here.

777
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:14,1
You fool.

778
00:37:14,027 --> 00:37:17,8
Not only do you not get the money, but now
you're going to jail for Pablo's murder.

779
00:37:17,094 --> 00:37:19,3
-Actually, he's not.
-He's not?

780
00:37:19,073 --> 00:37:20,8
No, Pete's alibi checks out.

781
00:37:20,094 --> 00:37:22,2
The grocery store security footage

782
00:37:22,036 --> 00:37:24,7
shows him there
during the time of Pablo's death.

783
00:37:24,082 --> 00:37:25,9
He's not the killer.

784
00:37:26,007 --> 00:37:28,2
Course not, I would never kill Pablo.
He was our cash cow.

785
00:37:28,049 --> 00:37:30,7
Always in debt, always getting bailed out.

786
00:37:30,095 --> 00:37:31,7
Bailed out by who?

787
00:37:31,087 --> 00:37:33,0
His business partner, Toby.

788
00:37:33,008 --> 00:37:36,0
Toby said he had no idea
that Pablo was into any trouble.

789
00:37:36,017 --> 00:37:38,2
Oh, well, imagine that.
You've been lied to.

790
00:37:53,072 --> 00:37:54,5
[click]

791
00:37:55,031 --> 00:37:57,1
Dan, I got the seller,
but he's not the killer.

792
00:37:57,019 --> 00:37:59,6
Have the team get ready
to take this place down anyhow.

793
00:37:59,077 --> 00:38:00,7
Copy that.

794
00:38:01,044 --> 00:38:04,1
You know who the killer is though,
don't you? Is it this Toby fellow?

795
00:38:04,019 --> 00:38:06,0
-[Chloe] I thought you didn't care.
-I don't.

796
00:38:06,011 --> 00:38:07,1
Just checking your logic,

797
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,4
since you've probably made
a lot of mistakes without me.

798
00:38:09,062 --> 00:38:12,7
Well, contrary to what you think,
I don't need your help.

799
00:38:15,012 --> 00:38:16,6
[Eve screaming] Lucifer, help!

800
00:38:17,021 --> 00:38:18,0
Eve?

801
00:38:18,012 --> 00:38:19,4
[Toby] Hand me the necklace.

802
00:38:21,075 --> 00:38:23,2
[Chloe] Drop the weapon.

803
00:38:23,042 --> 00:38:24,8
Toby, let her go.

804
00:38:24,092 --> 00:38:26,2
Back off! Back off.

805
00:38:26,097 --> 00:38:30,1
I am walking out of here
with this necklace. It belongs to me.

806
00:38:30,064 --> 00:38:33,1
Toby, I know everything and I understand.

807
00:38:33,022 --> 00:38:34,7
You understand? What do you understand?

808
00:38:34,085 --> 00:38:36,8
That I spent our entire budget
on this necklace?

809
00:38:36,093 --> 00:38:40,2
That I'm ruined without it? That I only
snuck in here to get what's mine?

810
00:38:40,035 --> 00:38:42,6
No. I understand you.

811
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,4
The reasonable one.

812
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:46,9
The one always taking care
of their partner.

813
00:38:47,078 --> 00:38:49,0
Cleaning up his messes.

814
00:38:49,086 --> 00:38:51,6
[Toby] Everybody loves Pablo.

815
00:38:52,066 --> 00:38:53,5
The fun one.

816
00:38:53,062 --> 00:38:55,4
But if they knew who he really was...

817
00:38:55,058 --> 00:38:56,6
He was a train wreck.

818
00:38:56,075 --> 00:38:59,4
He wasted all our money on hookers
and blow.

819
00:38:59,096 --> 00:39:01,7
That doesn't sound like such a bad guy
to me.

820
00:39:02,038 --> 00:39:04,2
[Toby] And after that voice mail...

821
00:39:04,096 --> 00:39:09,2
I rushed down there, found him beaten up,
the Mirage gone. I just...

822
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:11,0
I got so angry.

823
00:39:11,018 --> 00:39:12,6
Drop the gun and let her go.

824
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,0
Eve...

825
00:39:15,051 --> 00:39:17,4
you know that thing
you've always wanted to do?

826
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,9
-[whack]
-[Eve screams]

827
00:39:23,019 --> 00:39:24,3
-[wham]
-[thump]

828
00:39:24,077 --> 00:39:26,5
Turn over. Hands behind your back.

829
00:39:28,044 --> 00:39:29,4
-Oh, my...
-Are you alright?

830
00:39:29,057 --> 00:39:31,1
Yes. Did you see that?

831
00:39:31,024 --> 00:39:32,6
I did. You nailed it.

832
00:39:32,074 --> 00:39:33,6
[Eve gasps]

833
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:36,8
Daniel...

834
00:39:37,033 --> 00:39:39,5
I'd like that necklace,
thank you very much.

835
00:39:40,062 --> 00:39:43,5
What? Do you really think
we would just hand you stolen evidence?

836
00:39:45,013 --> 00:39:46,1
Turn over.

837
00:39:51,038 --> 00:39:52,3
Detective.

838
00:39:55,097 --> 00:39:57,2
we need that necklace.

839
00:39:59,085 --> 00:40:03,2
Ah, I'm sorry, Lucifer.
I wish I could help you.

840
00:40:05,073 --> 00:40:06,6
Come on.

841
00:40:16,062 --> 00:40:17,4
[sighs]

842
00:40:18,062 --> 00:40:19,6
[Amenadiel] See?

843
00:40:20,025 --> 00:40:21,1
We've got this.

844
00:40:22,033 --> 00:40:24,0
[sighing] We do, don't we?

845
00:40:24,008 --> 00:40:25,0
Mm-hmm.

846
00:40:28,038 --> 00:40:29,8
Bring it, angel baby.

847
00:40:30,001 --> 00:40:31,5
[Amenadiel chuckles]

848
00:40:32,009 --> 00:40:32,9
[door clunks]

849
00:40:34,043 --> 00:40:35,2
[door bangs]

850
00:40:37,014 --> 00:40:39,0
This some weird fetish
I don't know about?

851
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:41,1
Maze, hi. What are you doing here?

852
00:40:42,044 --> 00:40:43,2
Erm...

853
00:40:44,031 --> 00:40:46,1
well, I decided to...

854
00:40:46,081 --> 00:40:48,2
end Chloe's misery.

855
00:40:49,044 --> 00:40:50,3
I'm moving out.

856
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:53,5
Going somewhere where I'm wanted.

857
00:40:55,028 --> 00:40:56,8
Somewhere like here.

858
00:41:00,004 --> 00:41:00,8
[Linda] Oh.

859
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,8
Wow.

860
00:41:03,096 --> 00:41:05,3
Yeah, you know...

861
00:41:06,004 --> 00:41:08,7
Linda's not really prepared
for a house guest.

862
00:41:08,084 --> 00:41:11,2
This is happening, okay? Deal with it.

863
00:41:12,021 --> 00:41:15,5
Auntie Maze is here to help
with the baby, whether you like it or not.

864
00:41:15,068 --> 00:41:17,0
[Linda] Auntie Maze.

865
00:41:17,093 --> 00:41:18,7
I love it.

866
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:21,0
We can use all the help we can get.

867
00:41:21,064 --> 00:41:23,1
[Maze] Good. It's settled.

868
00:41:23,027 --> 00:41:25,3
Now, where do I put my knives?

869
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,4
[crash]

870
00:41:32,015 --> 00:41:36,3
So... if I can just get you to sign
my final paperwork of the night.

871
00:41:41,029 --> 00:41:42,4
The silent treatment.

872
00:41:43,062 --> 00:41:44,4
I get it.

873
00:41:44,066 --> 00:41:46,5
I shouldn't have told Lucifer that stuff.

874
00:41:46,062 --> 00:41:48,9
It was really unprofessional
and I'm so sorry.

875
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:51,0
Ella, I'm not mad at you.

876
00:41:52,034 --> 00:41:53,8
I just... I've...

877
00:41:54,092 --> 00:41:56,6
just been thinking about things.

878
00:41:57,013 --> 00:41:58,1
Between you and Lucifer?

879
00:42:00,055 --> 00:42:01,3
Yeah.

880
00:42:01,093 --> 00:42:02,7
Yeah.

881
00:42:03,043 --> 00:42:04,3
I miss him.

882
00:42:05,068 --> 00:42:08,1
I mean, he pisses me off all the time.

883
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:12,2
And there are so many things about him
that...

884
00:42:14,019 --> 00:42:15,7
that I find hard to accept,

885
00:42:15,082 --> 00:42:18,0
but I just have to believe
I can find a way.

886
00:42:19,032 --> 00:42:20,2
Because...

887
00:42:22,033 --> 00:42:24,4
I'd rather have him in my life than not.

888
00:42:26,075 --> 00:42:27,7
Well, then...

889
00:42:28,062 --> 00:42:30,3
I think you know what you need to do.

890
00:42:30,088 --> 00:42:32,7
[rock music playing]

891
00:42:48,014 --> 00:42:49,5
[Lucifer] I don't believe this.

892
00:42:49,081 --> 00:42:51,5
We were cheated out of that necklace.

893
00:42:52,094 --> 00:42:53,7
Well...

894
00:42:55,015 --> 00:43:00,3
on the bright side,
now we can break into the precinct and...

895
00:43:00,086 --> 00:43:02,0
steal it right back.

896
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:05,2
Doesn't that sound like fun?

897
00:43:05,095 --> 00:43:07,2
Yes, it does, actually.

898
00:43:07,029 --> 00:43:08,1
[laughs]

899
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:13,6
I had a really nice time with you tonight.

900
00:43:14,084 --> 00:43:15,7
As did I.

901
00:43:16,092 --> 00:43:19,4
Setback aside,
I think that we should celebrate.

902
00:43:20,093 --> 00:43:22,0
I'll get some champagne.

903
00:43:22,047 --> 00:43:23,7
[chink of metal]

904
00:43:24,047 --> 00:43:25,4
What's this?

905
00:43:32,052 --> 00:43:33,7
[Eve] I can explain that.

906
00:43:35,044 --> 00:43:36,8
How long have you had this?

907
00:43:37,057 --> 00:43:40,7
It dropped out of Toby's pocket when
you flipped him and I just grabbed it.

908
00:43:41,028 --> 00:43:42,8
And you weren't going to tell me?

909
00:43:42,091 --> 00:43:44,9
Of course I was. I just...

910
00:43:45,049 --> 00:43:46,7
Maybe not right away.

911
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:49,1
-Why?
-Because...

912
00:43:49,075 --> 00:43:52,5
you made it very clear
that once we found the necklace,

913
00:43:52,067 --> 00:43:54,5
we would go our separate ways and...

914
00:43:56,046 --> 00:43:58,3
I didn't want the fun to end.

915
00:43:58,071 --> 00:44:00,1
What else are you hiding from me?

916
00:44:00,022 --> 00:44:01,0
Nothing.

917
00:44:01,068 --> 00:44:02,5
You're lying.

918
00:44:05,064 --> 00:44:08,6
Okay, everything I told you is true.

919
00:44:10,077 --> 00:44:15,2
Except for maybe
one little, teeny, tiny part.

920
00:44:17,069 --> 00:44:22,1
I did come back to Earth for the fun
and the excitement.

921
00:44:23,007 --> 00:44:25,0
But, more specifically...

922
00:44:26,053 --> 00:44:27,5
I came back...

923
00:44:28,024 --> 00:44:29,1
for you.

924
00:44:30,041 --> 00:44:31,2
To be...

925
00:44:31,075 --> 00:44:32,6
with you.

926
00:44:33,058 --> 00:44:34,4
You know?

927
00:44:35,021 --> 00:44:36,5
Like old times.

928
00:44:37,017 --> 00:44:38,0
That was...

929
00:44:38,059 --> 00:44:40,3
thousands of years ago.

930
00:44:40,042 --> 00:44:44,1
Yes, but it was also
the best time of my life.

931
00:44:45,068 --> 00:44:49,4
Lucifer, I never felt more like myself
than when I was with you.

932
00:44:50,031 --> 00:44:51,1
Eve...

933
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:54,6
I'm sorry,
if you've come all this way for me...

934
00:44:56,023 --> 00:44:57,0
then...

935
00:44:58,002 --> 00:44:59,1
you've made a mistake.

936
00:45:00,053 --> 00:45:01,3
Why?

937
00:45:03,036 --> 00:45:04,8
It's because of her, isn't it?

938
00:45:06,024 --> 00:45:07,0
No.

939
00:45:07,074 --> 00:45:09,2
I told you, that's over.

940
00:45:11,004 --> 00:45:11,8
No.

941
00:45:13,075 --> 00:45:15,3
I mean your insecurity.

942
00:45:17,004 --> 00:45:18,2
I'm not insecure.

943
00:45:18,075 --> 00:45:20,0
Now who's lying?

944
00:45:21,092 --> 00:45:22,8
I'm not blind.

945
00:45:24,001 --> 00:45:26,5
I know what rejection looks like.

946
00:45:28,014 --> 00:45:29,3
What it feels like.

947
00:45:31,072 --> 00:45:34,6
The detective doesn't accept you
for who you are, does she?

948
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:39,7
No.

949
00:45:40,052 --> 00:45:41,3
She doesn't.

950
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,3
Well, I'm not her.

951
00:45:47,011 --> 00:45:48,3
You don't know me, Eve.

952
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:52,3
Who I truly am.

953
00:45:53,087 --> 00:45:54,7
Show me.

954
00:46:02,005 --> 00:46:02,8
Very well.

955
00:46:05,063 --> 00:46:06,7
You asked for it.

956
00:46:20,052 --> 00:46:21,3
[sniffs]

957
00:46:22,032 --> 00:46:23,6
I told you.

958
00:46:29,028 --> 00:46:30,8
I think you're amazing.

959
00:46:34,033 --> 00:46:35,2
All of you.

960
00:46:38,062 --> 00:46:43,0
["Hypnos" by Delhia de France playing]

961
00:47:11,024 --> 00:47:14,0
[music continues]
