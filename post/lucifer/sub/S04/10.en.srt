00:08:51,094 --> 00:08:52,8
I know who did it.

186
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:54,7
-You do?
-Yeah.

187
00:08:55,003 --> 00:08:56,7
Based on what Holla said in that video.

188
00:08:56,086 --> 00:08:58,8
The guy coming over
was obviously going to be...

189
00:08:58,091 --> 00:09:01,2
-Monopolize.
-Monopolize, exactly.

190
00:09:01,087 --> 00:09:02,8
Who's that?

191
00:09:03,033 --> 00:09:05,2
You've never heard
of the Mo-Holla squalla?

192
00:09:05,071 --> 00:09:07,2
-Uh-uh.
-Well, he's a rapper.

193
00:09:08,008 --> 00:09:09,5
-Monopolize.
-[Ella] Yeah.

194
00:09:09,084 --> 00:09:11,8
[Ella raps] "Mo, Monopolize,

195
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,7
Don't apologize.

196
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,5
Mo, monopolize,

197
00:09:15,063 --> 00:09:17,1
Don't ask me for my size."

198
00:09:17,026 --> 00:09:21,0
[raps] "You'll appreciate me
when I'm in your mother-effing thighs."

199
00:09:21,014 --> 00:09:22,8
-Nothing, huh?
-I've never, no.

200
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:26,5
He accused him of killing his BFF,
Fat Cannon.

201
00:09:26,064 --> 00:09:30,8
Nothing's ever been proven, but still,
biggest beef since Biggie and Tupac.

202
00:09:31,073 --> 00:09:32,5
Oh.

203
00:09:33,015 --> 00:09:34,5
-Yeah.
-[knocking on window]

204
00:09:34,061 --> 00:09:37,2
[knocking]
Detective! Detective!

205
00:09:38,003 --> 00:09:39,3
Why didn't you call me?

206
00:09:39,091 --> 00:09:43,7
-[Chloe] I told you, you need a break.
-I told you everything is under control.

207
00:09:44,008 --> 00:09:46,7
For now.
But how do you know it won't come back?

208
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:48,9
It won't. Trust me.

209
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:50,2
Look, I promise...

210
00:09:50,071 --> 00:09:53,4
you'll never have to see
anything monstrous ever again.

211
00:09:54,046 --> 00:09:55,3
Okay.

212
00:10:13,094 --> 00:10:15,1
[engine switches off]

213
00:10:15,099 --> 00:10:16,8
[doors slam]

214
00:10:21,091 --> 00:10:24,1
Lifestyles of the rich and tasteless.

215
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,8
Looks like Liberace had a yard sale.

216
00:10:27,062 --> 00:10:30,6
Yeah. Well, Mo's manager, Isaac,
lives here.

217
00:10:30,075 --> 00:10:32,5
Looks like he's home. Maybe Mo's here too.

218
00:10:32,067 --> 00:10:33,7
What are you doing?

219
00:10:34,084 --> 00:10:37,3
Don't worry, detective.
Now that everything's sorted,

220
00:10:37,047 --> 00:10:39,7
I've all the perks of devilhood
with no drawbacks.

221
00:10:39,084 --> 00:10:42,4
So rest assured,
nothing evil will be released.

222
00:10:42,055 --> 00:10:43,4
[gates clatter]

223
00:10:43,055 --> 00:10:44,9
-[gunshots]
-[Chloe gasps]

224
00:10:45,006 --> 00:10:47,2
-[Lucifer] Hell!
-[gunshots]

225
00:10:47,073 --> 00:10:48,9
[Chloe] LAPD!

226
00:10:49,052 --> 00:10:50,4
Stand down!

227
00:10:50,056 --> 00:10:51,5
[man] LAPD?

228
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:54,2
Why didn't you say so?

229
00:10:54,032 --> 00:10:57,0
Yeah, before you broke
my goddamn gate, y'all.

230
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:01,2
[Mo] I apologize for shooting at you.
Seriously.

231
00:11:02,003 --> 00:11:03,3
I'm not a violent man.

232
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:07,2
Well, the Desert Eagle that you just
opened up on us says differently.

233
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:09,2
Hot pocket?

234
00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:10,2
Oh, no thank you.

235
00:11:10,071 --> 00:11:14,1
Look, Holla and I had conflict.

236
00:11:14,021 --> 00:11:17,1
But we were about to bury the hatchet,
supposed to meet up this morning

237
00:11:17,025 --> 00:11:19,9
to announce we're dropping
a joint album and tour.

238
00:11:20,005 --> 00:11:21,9
Instead, he was the one who got dropped.

239
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,1
Come on, Mo.
You tell them what you told me.

240
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,3
Speak the truth, bro.

241
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:30,0
Sorry, look, this is going to sound crazy,

242
00:11:30,027 --> 00:11:32,3
but Holla isn't actually dead.

243
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,5
Well, that's impossible.
Forensic says he's dead.

244
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:36,7
I don't care what they say.
I'm telling you,

245
00:11:36,086 --> 00:11:38,3
I was walking to the studio

246
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,6
and I see a man dressed in leather
in the doorway.

247
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:43,3
I see his hands are all bloody,
so I back up quick.

248
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,4
Then a few seconds later,
Holla comes out,

249
00:11:45,057 --> 00:11:48,3
all bloody and shit
with a knife sticking out of his chest.

250
00:11:48,054 --> 00:11:50,9
-He was happy as a goddamn lamb.
-Clam.

251
00:11:51,004 --> 00:11:52,1
It's clam, bro.

252
00:11:52,025 --> 00:11:55,4
And tell them what you told me about
the car. That's pretty whack too, right?

253
00:11:55,054 --> 00:11:58,6
Didn't you say they got in
a pizza delivery car or some shit?

254
00:11:58,071 --> 00:12:01,1
Yeah, yeah. Pazo Papollo's Pizza.

255
00:12:01,022 --> 00:12:03,7
Right. Puff a bit of this before you left,
did you?

256
00:12:05,026 --> 00:12:07,8
A little bit. But I swear I ain't lying.

257
00:12:08,035 --> 00:12:11,6
We're going to need you to come down
to the station to verify your story.

258
00:12:11,073 --> 00:12:13,1
Gladly. Safer there than out here.

259
00:12:13,064 --> 00:12:16,5
[rap music playing]

260
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:21,6
[Ella] Hey, guys.

261
00:12:22,028 --> 00:12:25,1
So I've been monitoring social media
for any mention of Holla,

262
00:12:25,024 --> 00:12:27,0
and a fan just posted this.

263
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,1
Check it out...

264
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,9
looks like Monopolize
was telling the truth.

265
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,3
-[Chloe] Yeah.
-Can you see,

266
00:12:32,046 --> 00:12:35,4
"Hashtag fake death,"
"Hashtag publicity stunt."

267
00:12:35,058 --> 00:12:37,8
What? So the whole thing's a hoax?
No murder?

268
00:12:38,042 --> 00:12:40,0
Does that mean case closed then?

269
00:12:40,013 --> 00:12:41,9
[Ella] We've still got to find Holla.

270
00:12:42,001 --> 00:12:43,8
-He's got some explaining to do--
-No, yes.

271
00:12:44,068 --> 00:12:46,1
Yep, correct. Case closed.

272
00:12:46,026 --> 00:12:48,7
So you should probably head home, Lucifer,

273
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,6
because no victim, no case.

274
00:12:50,068 --> 00:12:53,8
Oh, very well. I suppose there'll be
another murder tomorrow.

275
00:12:53,093 --> 00:12:54,9
Fingers crossed.

276
00:13:06,074 --> 00:13:09,7
[church bell rings]

277
00:13:13,045 --> 00:13:14,3
Holla?

278
00:13:15,021 --> 00:13:16,1
Holla Bae?

279
00:13:18,054 --> 00:13:19,5
Father Kinley?

280
00:13:20,054 --> 00:13:21,6
[door bangs]

281
00:13:43,007 --> 00:13:43,9
[bump]

282
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:45,7
[click]

283
00:13:52,062 --> 00:13:53,5
[gun clicks]

284
00:13:53,062 --> 00:13:54,7
-Chloe.
-Maze.

285
00:13:55,004 --> 00:13:56,5
What are you doing here?

286
00:13:56,075 --> 00:13:58,1
I was tracking Kinley.

287
00:13:58,021 --> 00:14:00,9
Thought for sure he'd be here,
but now the trail's gone cold.

288
00:14:01,017 --> 00:14:02,1
Now you.

289
00:14:03,021 --> 00:14:04,2
I'm on a case.

290
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,0
A dead rapper.

291
00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:08,3
Well, not dead now, it seems.

292
00:14:08,038 --> 00:14:10,8
But a witness told us this crazy story

293
00:14:10,089 --> 00:14:13,0
that he saw the victim
with a knife in his chest.

294
00:14:13,014 --> 00:14:15,0
-I've no idea what's going on.
-Wait--

295
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:16,5
Dead, then not dead?

296
00:14:17,098 --> 00:14:18,9
I think I do.

297
00:14:20,098 --> 00:14:24,8
[club music playing]

298
00:14:25,061 --> 00:14:26,7
[man roars] Lucifer!

299
00:14:28,065 --> 00:14:29,5
Lucifer.

300
00:14:30,061 --> 00:14:31,4
Lucifer!

301
00:14:32,003 --> 00:14:32,9
Lucifer!

302
00:14:33,091 --> 00:14:35,1
[grating laugh]

303
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,5
Lucifer. Oh! [claps back]

304
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:38,7
Oh!

305
00:14:39,062 --> 00:14:41,7
We've missed you so damn much.

306
00:14:44,034 --> 00:14:45,8
Oh. Mm!

307
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:47,0
Put me down!

308
00:14:48,067 --> 00:14:50,7
Forgive me, my king.

309
00:14:51,084 --> 00:14:52,6
Hey.

310
00:14:53,051 --> 00:14:55,3
It's just so great to see you.

311
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:03,3
Dromos?

312
00:15:05,098 --> 00:15:08,9
You see, Squee?
I told you he'd recognize me.

313
00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:10,4
But...

314
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,4
what are you doing here?

315
00:15:13,016 --> 00:15:14,6
We're here for you, of course.

316
00:15:15,016 --> 00:15:16,4
To help you get back home.

317
00:15:19,033 --> 00:15:20,2
[light chuckle]

318
00:15:22,033 --> 00:15:27,7
So you're saying there are two murderous
demons on the loose in Los Angeles?

319
00:15:27,096 --> 00:15:30,7
Yeah. And one appears to have entered
Kinley's body.

320
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,0
And they, or you...

321
00:15:33,093 --> 00:15:36,3
can just jump into a human's body
whenever you want?

322
00:15:36,064 --> 00:15:37,4
No.

323
00:15:38,022 --> 00:15:41,7
The... body has to belong
to a dead, doomed soul

324
00:15:41,081 --> 00:15:45,3
or a demon wouldn't know where or when
there was a recent vacancy.

325
00:15:45,052 --> 00:15:46,8
So someone killed Kinley.

326
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:49,6
At least I don't have to worry about him
hurting Lucifer anymore.

327
00:15:49,094 --> 00:15:50,7
No.

328
00:15:51,007 --> 00:15:54,0
But whatever demon's taken over
his body better be worried.

329
00:15:54,045 --> 00:15:57,7
Lucifer's going to be pissed.
He banned possession years ago.

330
00:15:59,054 --> 00:16:01,2
Well, something's clearly changed.

331
00:16:01,054 --> 00:16:04,2
So there I am, hanging in hell...

332
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,6
popping out eyeballs
like any other Tuesday,

333
00:16:07,075 --> 00:16:08,7
and this priest...

334
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:11,4
he just shows up on my docket.

335
00:16:11,051 --> 00:16:14,4
Is this one of those "priest
walks into a bar" jokes? I love them.

336
00:16:14,064 --> 00:16:16,8
Dude was boring.

337
00:16:16,093 --> 00:16:20,8
I mean, all he kept saying was,
"Prophecy this, prophecy that.

338
00:16:20,093 --> 00:16:24,2
I've got a stupid accent.
Makes me sound like a pirate. Argh!"

339
00:16:24,031 --> 00:16:25,1
[laughs]

340
00:16:25,065 --> 00:16:29,4
Anyway, he says that he needs help
getting you back to hell, so...

341
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:31,0
of course...

342
00:16:31,036 --> 00:16:33,3
Dromos, ever loyal...

343
00:16:33,099 --> 00:16:35,0
I did not hesitate.

344
00:16:35,049 --> 00:16:37,5
I came straight here to answer your call.

345
00:16:38,003 --> 00:16:39,5
[Lucifer laughs]

346
00:16:39,062 --> 00:16:40,6
Of course.

347
00:16:41,025 --> 00:16:43,4
This is Kinley's hail Mary.

348
00:16:43,054 --> 00:16:48,4
His final attempt to subvert the prophecy
by tricking me into returning.

349
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,8
[laughing] Voluntarily!

350
00:16:51,055 --> 00:16:54,3
Well, it's an admirable plan,
but he needn't have bothered.

351
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:56,4
I've just beaten the prophecy on my own.

352
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,1
Besides...

353
00:16:59,005 --> 00:17:00,9
no way in hell I'd ever return to...

354
00:17:01,068 --> 00:17:03,1
well, you know...

355
00:17:03,085 --> 00:17:04,7
Lucifer.

356
00:17:05,073 --> 00:17:07,7
You've been on vacation forever.

357
00:17:09,015 --> 00:17:10,9
You didn't write, you didn't call.

358
00:17:11,057 --> 00:17:14,5
You didn't even send a burnt offering.
The demons of Hell...

359
00:17:15,086 --> 00:17:17,1
they need a king.

360
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,0
Very well.

361
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,8
Dromos of the Lilim,

362
00:17:22,045 --> 00:17:25,0
by the power of Grayskull,
blah-di-blah-di-blah,

363
00:17:25,016 --> 00:17:27,5
I hereby name you King of Hell.

364
00:17:27,058 --> 00:17:29,1
There you go. Throne's all yours.

365
00:17:30,009 --> 00:17:32,5
[short laugh]
Yeah, that's really funny.

366
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:35,1
But we all know that the king...

367
00:17:35,092 --> 00:17:37,1
he needs to be an angel.

368
00:17:39,005 --> 00:17:40,4
Fair point, yeah.

369
00:17:40,055 --> 00:17:41,4
Lucifer.

370
00:17:42,043 --> 00:17:45,5
Hell has been really bad since you left.

371
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:49,7
Oh, that's a shame, because it was
a real vacation destination before.

372
00:17:50,086 --> 00:17:52,6
What's so great about Earth, anyway?

373
00:17:52,078 --> 00:17:55,5
Well, no offense,
but the company's far greater,

374
00:17:55,061 --> 00:17:59,0
the work more interesting
and the liquor far superior.

375
00:17:59,028 --> 00:18:00,1
Mm!

376
00:18:00,095 --> 00:18:04,2
And I've just become an uncle and someone
needs to teach my nephew about sex,

377
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:06,5
because...
my brother's certainly not capable.

378
00:18:07,058 --> 00:18:08,4
So.

379
00:18:09,008 --> 00:18:10,7
Back to hell you go, it seems.

380
00:18:11,084 --> 00:18:13,9
Those eyeballs won't pop themselves out.

381
00:18:16,084 --> 00:18:17,9
Alright.

382
00:18:18,043 --> 00:18:20,3
I think we might stay for a little bit.

383
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,5
I've never tortured...

384
00:18:23,006 --> 00:18:23,8
a live one.

385
00:18:25,085 --> 00:18:27,2
-[clap]
-[groan]

386
00:18:27,031 --> 00:18:30,1
You will not lay a hand on anyone.

387
00:18:30,085 --> 00:18:33,6
You're lucky I haven't incinerated you
already for disobeying my orders.

388
00:18:33,077 --> 00:18:35,9
No more possession.

389
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:40,0
Time for all good demons...

390
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:41,6
to go home.

391
00:18:42,074 --> 00:18:43,5
Now.

392
00:18:47,066 --> 00:18:48,5
Yes...

393
00:18:49,046 --> 00:18:50,5
my lord.

394
00:18:58,034 --> 00:19:04,9
[animal noises in background]

395
00:19:05,076 --> 00:19:06,8
What is that?

396
00:19:08,006 --> 00:19:09,8
Arias of the humpback whale.

397
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,1
Isn't it amazing?

398
00:19:12,002 --> 00:19:14,1
And perfect for a nice, relaxing bath,

399
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:17,1
which I've just drawn you, so...

400
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:20,5
if you wouldn't mind
handing little Charlie over to me...

401
00:19:20,065 --> 00:19:22,5
You know, I'm good. Thank you though.

402
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:24,2
Okay.

403
00:19:27,012 --> 00:19:30,3
Linda, you'll have to put him down
at some point. Your arms will atrophy.

404
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,5
I suppose you're right.

405
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:34,1
I could use a nap.

406
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,7
Or maybe I should feed him again.

407
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:42,0
Or get him another blanket.

408
00:19:42,051 --> 00:19:43,6
Or take this blanket off.

409
00:19:43,076 --> 00:19:46,6
How do you know what temperature
babies like when they can't talk?

410
00:19:47,097 --> 00:19:50,9
Okay, I admit I could be
being a little bit...

411
00:19:51,069 --> 00:19:53,9
helicopter-y, but I mean, I just...

412
00:19:53,098 --> 00:19:54,8
[laughs]

413
00:19:56,036 --> 00:19:58,9
I just love him so much.

414
00:20:00,011 --> 00:20:00,9
[baby coos]

415
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:04,9
I just spent so much time worrying.

416
00:20:06,095 --> 00:20:08,0
But you were right.

417
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,3
We've got this.

418
00:20:11,075 --> 00:20:14,3
And we're going to give him
a beautiful life, aren't we?

419
00:20:16,025 --> 00:20:17,0
Yeah.

420
00:20:18,063 --> 00:20:20,4
[Linda sighs]

421
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,1
Here we go, dada.

422
00:20:29,043 --> 00:20:30,4
Okay.

423
00:20:31,056 --> 00:20:33,4
Oh, you know what? I almost forgot.

424
00:20:33,052 --> 00:20:35,0
I hired a night nurse.

425
00:20:35,065 --> 00:20:38,5
Her name's Kim
and she'll be here any minute.

426
00:20:39,073 --> 00:20:41,9
So we can both get some rest.

427
00:20:43,028 --> 00:20:45,1
Yeah. Come on, bub-bub.

428
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:47,2
[kiss]

429
00:21:04,026 --> 00:21:05,0
Lucifer!

430
00:21:05,018 --> 00:21:07,5
[gasps]

431
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,1
Am I dreaming?

432
00:21:09,064 --> 00:21:11,3
No, I can't be, you're both dressed.

433
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,7
We've got a situation.
Demons are roaming the Earth.

434
00:21:14,098 --> 00:21:16,2
Oh, is that all?

435
00:21:17,002 --> 00:21:18,9
Well, I already know. I saw them earlier.

436
00:21:19,002 --> 00:21:22,3
It seems Kinley summoned them
to take me back to Hell.

437
00:21:22,069 --> 00:21:25,1
His last-ditch attempt
to squash the prophecy.

438
00:21:25,024 --> 00:21:28,3
But don't worry, crisis averted.
I sent them packing.

439
00:21:29,003 --> 00:21:32,4
And besides, the demons in question,
Dromos and Squee,

440
00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:35,7
hardly the brightest bulbs
in the hellfire chandelier.

441
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,8
I hate those two. Especially Squee.

442
00:21:37,092 --> 00:21:39,4
Well, everyone hates Squee.

443
00:21:39,084 --> 00:21:41,3
Anyway, I'm getting my knives.

444
00:21:41,071 --> 00:21:44,7
In case those two idiots
get lost on their way home.

445
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,7
You do that.

446
00:21:46,076 --> 00:21:49,1
[Chloe sighs]
Lucifer, what if we're wrong?

447
00:21:50,005 --> 00:21:53,7
What if we're wrong about the prophecy
and "evil shall be released"

448
00:21:53,085 --> 00:21:56,2
really means that demons
are going to be running around?

449
00:21:56,035 --> 00:21:57,2
You know, may--

450
00:21:58,035 --> 00:22:01,1
Maybe you should leave town
until we figure this out.

451
00:22:01,057 --> 00:22:04,1
I assure you,
there's no need for me to flee and...

452
00:22:05,007 --> 00:22:08,9
-how did Maze rope you into this, anyway?
-I ran into her. Sort of.

453
00:22:09,095 --> 00:22:11,2
Following a lead about Kinley.

454
00:22:12,033 --> 00:22:13,2
Without me?

455
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,6
Yeah. I was afraid.

456
00:22:19,012 --> 00:22:20,5
Of what he might trigger in you.

457
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:23,9
Afraid he might turn me
back into a monster.

458
00:22:24,038 --> 00:22:25,3
Yes.

459
00:22:26,009 --> 00:22:26,9
Er, no.

460
00:22:27,001 --> 00:22:29,0
There's no need for you to explain.
I get it.

461
00:22:30,026 --> 00:22:32,1
Perhaps you should leave, detective.

462
00:22:32,093 --> 00:22:35,1
I mean, you never know
what might be triggered.

463
00:22:35,027 --> 00:22:36,4
[phone buzzes]

464
00:22:36,052 --> 00:22:37,4
[Chloe sighs]

465
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,6
We need to go to Linda's. Now.

466
00:22:39,069 --> 00:22:42,2
[police sirens wail]

467
00:22:42,031 --> 00:22:43,1
Linda!

468
00:22:48,078 --> 00:22:50,0
[Linda whimpers]

469
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,1
What happened?

470
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,1
Charlie...

471
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,1
[sniffs]

472
00:22:58,025 --> 00:22:59,9
He's... [sniffs]

473
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,9
He's gone.

474
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:07,3
[sniffs, whimpers]

475
00:23:10,009 --> 00:23:12,5
I just questioned Kim Fisher,
the night nurse Linda was expecting.

476
00:23:12,064 --> 00:23:14,3
Turns out she never made it to the house.

477
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:16,7
Agency called her,
said the family canceled last minute.

478
00:23:16,085 --> 00:23:19,0
And no-one's heard from Amenadiel yet?

479
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:22,7
But there's still no reason to believe
he doesn't have the baby, right?

480
00:23:22,085 --> 00:23:25,3
Yeah, I'm sure
there's a totally reasonable explanation

481
00:23:25,044 --> 00:23:28,5
for why he's been gone for hours,
without answering his phone.

482
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:30,2
I'm going to call Chloe.

483
00:23:33,057 --> 00:23:35,7
No, I didn't call the agency,
so that means,

484
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,5
-Amenadiel probably did.
-Yeah.

485
00:23:37,095 --> 00:23:40,0
Yeah, I'm sure Amenadiel
canceled the nurse,

486
00:23:40,012 --> 00:23:44,6
because he wanted to spend some more time
with the baby.

487
00:23:44,092 --> 00:23:46,1
And then Charlie...

488
00:23:46,096 --> 00:23:48,7
probably got fussy and...

489
00:23:49,013 --> 00:23:51,3
and... and he didn't want to wake me.

490
00:23:52,034 --> 00:23:53,2
And, erm...

491
00:23:54,005 --> 00:23:56,9
so he probably took him for a ride
in the car.

492
00:23:57,006 --> 00:23:59,5
[breathes shakily]

493
00:24:00,031 --> 00:24:02,7
I'm sure they're somewhere safe and sound,
right?

494
00:24:03,048 --> 00:24:04,4
-Yeah, right.
-Um...

495
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,2
Linda...

496
00:24:07,019 --> 00:24:09,5
there's something
I think I need to tell you.

497
00:24:09,094 --> 00:24:14,5
The good news is I think you're right,
I think Amenadiel has the child safe.

498
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,9
The bad news is
I think it's my least favorite place.

499
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:19,6
Heaven.

500
00:24:23,096 --> 00:24:26,2
Are you trying to tell me
that Charlie is...

501
00:24:26,033 --> 00:24:28,8
Oh, no! No, no. Of course not.

502
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,2
That baby is half-angel.

503
00:24:30,034 --> 00:24:33,0
He can come and go from heaven freely.
He just needs...

504
00:24:33,018 --> 00:24:34,5
someone to bring him.

505
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:40,1
So Amenadiel took our baby from me?

506
00:24:42,068 --> 00:24:43,6
To live in heaven?

507
00:24:43,094 --> 00:24:44,9
I'll kill him.

508
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,7
I am so sorry, Linda.

509
00:24:46,086 --> 00:24:49,2
I should have gleaned
Amenadiel's intentions earlier.

510
00:24:49,036 --> 00:24:50,7
He tried to tell me in the hospital

511
00:24:50,082 --> 00:24:54,4
and I thought we were talking
about turtle necks versus crew necks.

512
00:24:54,049 --> 00:24:56,0
[laughs]
But if it's any consolation,

513
00:24:56,011 --> 00:24:59,4
I do think Amenadiel
is simply trying to keep Charlie safe.

514
00:24:59,095 --> 00:25:01,0
[door rattles]

515
00:25:03,025 --> 00:25:04,0
Hey.

516
00:25:05,033 --> 00:25:07,2
[yells] How could you? [thump]

517
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:09,2
You go back and get him!

518
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,4
You go back!

519
00:25:10,071 --> 00:25:13,4
-What? I never took Charlie--
-You heard. Right now!

520
00:25:13,055 --> 00:25:14,3
Wait, wait.

521
00:25:15,084 --> 00:25:17,8
-Wait a minute. He's not here?
-No.

522
00:25:17,093 --> 00:25:20,9
-Because you took him up there.
-No, Linda, I swear I didn't.

523
00:25:22,072 --> 00:25:24,8
Look, I was going to,

524
00:25:24,098 --> 00:25:25,9
but then I...

525
00:25:26,014 --> 00:25:27,0
I couldn't.

526
00:25:27,019 --> 00:25:29,7
What you said to me
right before you went to sleep, I...

527
00:25:30,048 --> 00:25:34,4
I was just so confused,
and I just needed to clear my head, so...

528
00:25:35,053 --> 00:25:37,2
I decided to go for a long walk.

529
00:25:37,028 --> 00:25:39,2
But I handed Charlie to the night nurse.

530
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,9
The nurse never came to the house,
Amenadiel.

531
00:25:42,054 --> 00:25:43,6
[Amenadiel] What?

532
00:25:44,012 --> 00:25:47,9
Yes. Yes, she was. She was rocking
Charlie to sleep when I left.

533
00:25:50,067 --> 00:25:52,8
Is that the woman
you handed Charlie off to?

534
00:25:55,005 --> 00:25:55,8
No.

535
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:57,7
No, that's not her.

536
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,6
[Dan] Hey, Chloe.
We tracked the call to the agency.

537
00:26:07,073 --> 00:26:10,7
-The one canceling the nurse.
-Phone is registered to a Lyla Claybourne.

538
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:12,4
SWAT is on their way to her apartment.

539
00:26:12,052 --> 00:26:13,3
[Chloe] Okay.

540
00:26:13,044 --> 00:26:14,7
Will you send a photo of Lyla?

541
00:26:14,082 --> 00:26:17,7
I want to confirm with Amenadiel
it's the same person that took the baby.

542
00:26:17,082 --> 00:26:18,6
Of course.

543
00:26:18,074 --> 00:26:20,7
Hey, Chloe,
could you tell Linda and Amenadiel

544
00:26:20,087 --> 00:26:24,1
that everyone here is praying for them--
pulling for them. Okay?

545
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:26,2
Okay, thanks.

546
00:26:31,084 --> 00:26:32,7
Ella, are you okay?

547
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:37,3
Hey... I hope you know
that I'm here for you.

548
00:26:37,076 --> 00:26:38,6
You're not alone.

549
00:26:39,018 --> 00:26:42,4
See, that's just it.
I never used to feel alone.

550
00:26:44,014 --> 00:26:45,8
Because I always had the big guy.

551
00:26:47,027 --> 00:26:48,6
I really miss him.

552
00:26:49,006 --> 00:26:51,1
I was just so mad.

553
00:26:52,073 --> 00:26:54,0
So mad after...

554
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,1
you know, Charlotte.

555
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,4
I've been mad too.

556
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,2
Really mad.

557
00:27:01,095 --> 00:27:03,4
It's just so much.

558
00:27:04,033 --> 00:27:06,1
-Yeah.
-But I don't think it's right for me

559
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,5
to base my faith
on whether everything is...

560
00:27:09,016 --> 00:27:12,0
good and unicorns and ice cream.

561
00:27:13,025 --> 00:27:16,2
I don't think it's God's job
to stop the bad.

562
00:27:18,084 --> 00:27:19,9
I actually think...

563
00:27:21,018 --> 00:27:23,8
he's there to give us the strength
to get through it.

564
00:27:24,001 --> 00:27:24,8
[sniffs]

565
00:27:28,027 --> 00:27:29,1
[kiss]

566
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:34,2
[phone buzzes]

567
00:27:35,052 --> 00:27:36,3
Amenadiel...

568
00:27:38,086 --> 00:27:39,7
That's her.

569
00:27:43,074 --> 00:27:45,8
That's Lyla? That's who's got Charlie?

570
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:48,4
Detective, I saw her last night in Lux.

571
00:27:49,091 --> 00:27:51,5
I think I know who has the baby.

572
00:27:56,054 --> 00:27:57,9
-[baby cries]
-Shh.

573
00:27:59,071 --> 00:28:02,0
You're such a little cutie.

574
00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:05,0
-I'm going to teach you so much.
-[bash]

575
00:28:05,022 --> 00:28:06,1
Yes, I am.

576
00:28:06,047 --> 00:28:07,9
-Everything I know.
-[thud]

577
00:28:08,014 --> 00:28:09,1
Shh.

578
00:28:09,064 --> 00:28:12,1
[baby cries]

579
00:28:12,027 --> 00:28:14,1
That's right, my little angel.

580
00:28:15,073 --> 00:28:18,7
-[baby cries]
-Who's da new king of Hell?

581
00:28:18,098 --> 00:28:20,2
Yes, you are.

582
00:28:20,086 --> 00:28:22,8
-That's right.
-[knife scrapes]

583
00:28:23,045 --> 00:28:24,5
Can you say...

584
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,8
"Lucifer who?"

585
00:28:26,095 --> 00:28:28,5
[baby cries]

586
00:28:28,062 --> 00:28:31,2
Lucifer who? Shh.

587
00:28:35,008 --> 00:28:37,2
[Dan]
SWAT just cleared Lyla's apartment.

588
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:38,2
What about Lyla?

589
00:28:38,029 --> 00:28:41,4
She's not there either. But there is
a big pool of blood in the bedroom.

590
00:28:42,092 --> 00:28:44,3
Another blood pool without a body.

591
00:28:44,047 --> 00:28:48,2
I still can't find any connection between
Kinley, Holla Bae or Lyla Claybourne.

592
00:28:48,035 --> 00:28:50,0
Maybe Kinley brainwashed the other two,

593
00:28:50,014 --> 00:28:51,6
like he did that Los Xs guy, remember?

594
00:28:51,077 --> 00:28:55,9
That's a really weird, weird choice
in new minions, but yeah, maybe.

595
00:28:56,015 --> 00:28:58,5
And maybe we'll get a hit
on the APB we put out.

596
00:28:58,094 --> 00:29:01,0
[Lucifer] Detective... a word.

597
00:29:01,082 --> 00:29:02,7
[Chloe] Excuse me.

598
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,3
[clears throat]

599
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:11,0
Detective, another blood pool with no body
means another demon.

600
00:29:11,012 --> 00:29:14,1
Yeah.
Should we just tell Dan and Ella the truth

601
00:29:14,025 --> 00:29:16,6
about who or what these cadavers
really are?

602
00:29:16,075 --> 00:29:20,1
I mean, the more teammates playing
the real game, the better, right?

603
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:23,1
No. They'll never believe us. [chuckles]

604
00:29:23,051 --> 00:29:25,3
I mean, not unless I show them,

605
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:29,4
and you certainly know how long it takes
to recover, or not recover, from that.

606
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:34,2
Yes. Back at the penthouse,
I was trying to tell you that I'm not--

607
00:29:34,035 --> 00:29:35,8
Detective,
I can't believe I'm saying this,

608
00:29:35,094 --> 00:29:37,9
but there are more important things
than me right now.

609
00:29:38,065 --> 00:29:39,5
Okay.

610
00:29:39,061 --> 00:29:40,9
Then we need to figure out

611
00:29:41,007 --> 00:29:44,2
why demon Kinley and his crew
would take Charlie.

612
00:29:44,099 --> 00:29:48,0
Well, it's clearly all about me.
I ordered them to go home,

613
00:29:48,016 --> 00:29:50,6
they got angry, and they're doing this
to get back at me.

614
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:52,8
How do we find three demons and a baby?

615
00:29:52,095 --> 00:29:56,4
Uh... three demons and a baby?
That's one of my favorite movies.

616
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:59,5
-Not as good as the original though.
-[laughing] So true, so true.

617
00:30:00,021 --> 00:30:03,3
Why don't we go back to my penthouse
where we can strategize freely?

618
00:30:03,042 --> 00:30:04,2
Yeah, yeah.

619
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,6
Yeah.

620
00:30:12,014 --> 00:30:14,1
[Eve] Dromos, what are you doing here?

621
00:30:15,077 --> 00:30:17,1
Did you find Lucifer?

622
00:30:17,094 --> 00:30:20,6
Have you convinced him
to go back to Hell?

623
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:22,9
How did you find me?

624
00:30:23,044 --> 00:30:24,9
I used a Find My Phone app.

625
00:30:25,053 --> 00:30:27,2
Because you still have my phone.

626
00:30:27,028 --> 00:30:30,6
Remember? The one I gave you
to give me updates on.

627
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:32,5
The one you are not answering.

628
00:30:32,066 --> 00:30:35,9
Ah. Yeah, it makes sense. Want some wine?

629
00:30:36,045 --> 00:30:37,4
No!

630
00:30:37,075 --> 00:30:38,8
I don't want wine.

631
00:30:39,012 --> 00:30:41,1
I want to know what you've been up to.

632
00:30:41,092 --> 00:30:44,6
-Have you even spoken to Lucifer yet?
-Yeah.

633
00:30:45,042 --> 00:30:46,5
Well, didn't go so well.

634
00:30:49,043 --> 00:30:52,9
Well, yeah, he can be stubborn.

635
00:30:54,035 --> 00:30:57,2
-Maybe we can talk to him together.
-No.

636
00:30:57,098 --> 00:30:58,8
Change of plans.

637
00:31:00,014 --> 00:31:01,0
Dromos...

638
00:31:02,023 --> 00:31:03,4
I think we've got enough.

639
00:31:04,069 --> 00:31:07,2
-We're ready for The Mayan.
-Who are you?

640
00:31:07,036 --> 00:31:10,2
[baby crying]

641
00:31:14,012 --> 00:31:16,4
Dromos, this stupid thing won't shut up.

642
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,4
Can I cut its tongue out?

643
00:31:18,054 --> 00:31:20,5
No. You may not.

644
00:31:20,062 --> 00:31:21,5
What's going on?

645
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:23,2
[Dromos] Like I said.

646
00:31:23,096 --> 00:31:24,9
change of plans.

647
00:31:25,042 --> 00:31:28,7
Look, I summoned you here to get Lucifer,

648
00:31:28,084 --> 00:31:32,6
not terrorize some poor, innocent child.

649
00:31:32,072 --> 00:31:33,6
You listen to me.

650
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,4
I...

651
00:31:36,043 --> 00:31:37,6
I command you--

652
00:31:37,068 --> 00:31:39,3
[yells] Stop talking!

653
00:31:40,081 --> 00:31:43,1
[baby crying]

654
00:31:45,027 --> 00:31:46,2
[Eve gasps]

655
00:31:48,007 --> 00:31:50,6
I don't take orders from you.

656
00:31:51,099 --> 00:31:55,6
You are not our king.

657
00:31:58,016 --> 00:32:00,8
Speaking of,
we don't need Lucifer anymore.

658
00:32:02,033 --> 00:32:04,2
Or you, for that matter.

659
00:32:06,017 --> 00:32:07,3
[swish]

660
00:32:08,025 --> 00:32:09,0
[thud]

661
00:32:13,043 --> 00:32:16,3
No news from my brother or Maze.
Perhaps I should get them here as well.

662
00:32:18,047 --> 00:32:20,1
-[whispers] Lucifer!
-[sighs]

663
00:32:21,018 --> 00:32:22,3
[Lucifer] They did this.

664
00:32:22,081 --> 00:32:26,4
Vile demons, trying to get back at me
with aimless destruction.

665
00:32:26,052 --> 00:32:27,7
This wasn't aimless.

666
00:32:28,057 --> 00:32:29,9
They were searching for something.

667
00:32:31,086 --> 00:32:32,9
Detective, my safe's open.

668
00:32:33,091 --> 00:32:35,6
What? Is anything missing?

669
00:32:35,074 --> 00:32:37,2
It doesn't appear so.

670
00:32:37,074 --> 00:32:39,0
Cash is all here.

671
00:32:40,045 --> 00:32:41,4
Oh, no.

672
00:32:42,096 --> 00:32:44,1
The vial's gone.

673
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,9
Kinley's vial?

674
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:48,2
You kept that?

675
00:32:48,034 --> 00:32:51,0
I didn't think it was something
I could just toss down the drain.

676
00:32:52,005 --> 00:32:55,0
I was going to chuck it out
with our spent batteries.

677
00:32:55,059 --> 00:32:57,3
What would they want with the vial?

678
00:32:59,085 --> 00:33:01,3
They're not trying to get back at me.

679
00:33:01,085 --> 00:33:03,3
They're trying to replace me.

680
00:33:05,065 --> 00:33:07,1
How could they possibly do that?

681
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:11,1
Hell was built so that no demon
could take control of the throne.

682
00:33:11,019 --> 00:33:12,3
Only a celestial could rule.

683
00:33:12,094 --> 00:33:14,0
An angel. But...

684
00:33:14,078 --> 00:33:16,4
I suppose half an angel would do.

685
00:33:17,024 --> 00:33:18,2
Baby Charlie.

686
00:33:19,033 --> 00:33:20,7
Since I refused to return,

687
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:23,2
it seems they're intent on raising
their own king.

688
00:33:24,029 --> 00:33:26,7
Luce, thank God you're here.
Something awful's--

689
00:33:26,083 --> 00:33:29,1
Not now, Eve!
We are dealing with our own situation.

690
00:33:29,025 --> 00:33:30,6
It's about Kinley.

691
00:33:31,071 --> 00:33:35,3
Or at least the body
formerly known as Kinley anyway.

692
00:33:35,043 --> 00:33:37,0
What do you know about that?

693
00:33:37,093 --> 00:33:40,3
I was the one who broke him out of jail.
Yeah.

694
00:33:40,093 --> 00:33:43,3
And then he attacked me, so...

695
00:33:44,023 --> 00:33:45,7
I, well...

696
00:33:46,073 --> 00:33:47,9
I killed him.

697
00:33:49,036 --> 00:33:53,1
And then I kind of, sort of...

698
00:33:53,065 --> 00:33:56,7
summoned a demon from Hell
into his body.

699
00:33:58,045 --> 00:33:59,3
What?

700
00:33:59,041 --> 00:34:01,6
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

701
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:06,1
I thought maybe he could convince you
that the prophecy was nonsense.

702
00:34:07,012 --> 00:34:09,7
But he wouldn't budge
and then he gave me this idea

703
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:12,8
that maybe if I could get you out of here,
back to Hell,

704
00:34:12,088 --> 00:34:14,7
that everything would be good again.

705
00:34:15,063 --> 00:34:17,5
I didn't mean for anyone to get hurt.

706
00:34:18,013 --> 00:34:21,4
-Especially not that poor little baby.
-That's my nephew, Eve.

707
00:34:21,055 --> 00:34:23,2
Eve, how could you do this?

708
00:34:23,035 --> 00:34:26,8
How could you be so selfish? Naive?

709
00:34:26,093 --> 00:34:28,6
Where's the baby now, Eve?

710
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:31,1
[gasping] I don't know.

711
00:34:31,044 --> 00:34:35,2
I don't know. They were in a church
and they knocked me out,

712
00:34:35,032 --> 00:34:37,9
and by the time I came to, they were gone.

713
00:34:42,087 --> 00:34:43,7
[Chloe] Okay.

714
00:34:44,008 --> 00:34:45,6
Alright, if they took the vial,

715
00:34:45,075 --> 00:34:48,7
they're probably planning
on performing the same ceremony...

716
00:34:49,017 --> 00:34:51,1
-that Kinley was going to perform on--
-On me?

717
00:34:51,025 --> 00:34:53,3
-Yes.
-So come on, tell us, detective,

718
00:34:53,084 --> 00:34:56,0
once you'd served up
this holy, anointed sedative,

719
00:34:56,009 --> 00:34:59,5
where was this ceremony to take place,
back when you wanted me in Hell?

720
00:35:00,072 --> 00:35:01,9
Well, as you know,

721
00:35:02,047 --> 00:35:03,8
I didn't go through with it.

722
00:35:05,001 --> 00:35:06,6
I know he mentioned a church.

723
00:35:07,018 --> 00:35:10,4
Great. There's what,
only 2, 3,000 of those in LA?

724
00:35:12,036 --> 00:35:16,5
He said specifically that it had to be
a house of worship,

725
00:35:16,065 --> 00:35:18,2
but also a den of sin.

726
00:35:18,078 --> 00:35:22,7
One of the demons mentioned something
about one of those old civilizations.

727
00:35:24,058 --> 00:35:26,9
Aztec? Or Inca?

728
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:30,6
Do you think they could be going
to one of those ancient temples

729
00:35:30,071 --> 00:35:32,9
where they used to have human sacrifices?

730
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:34,4
-Love him.
-Listen.

731
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,4
I used to hate him.

732
00:35:35,092 --> 00:35:38,5
But we're going to make an announcement
about my tour kicking off

733
00:35:38,059 --> 00:35:39,8
tomorrow night at The Mayan.

734
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:41,1
The Mayan, that's it!

735
00:35:41,022 --> 00:35:44,3
Okay, it's a venue.
Rents to concerts and also...

736
00:35:44,064 --> 00:35:45,8
I think, church groups.

737
00:35:45,093 --> 00:35:47,6
Sex, drugs, rock and roll and my dad.

738
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:49,8
That sounds like the oxymoronic venue
we're after.

739
00:35:49,093 --> 00:35:51,6
It's going to be empty and available,

740
00:35:51,073 --> 00:35:54,2
especially since Holla isn't playing there
tonight.

741
00:35:56,036 --> 00:35:57,4
You stay here.

742
00:35:57,094 --> 00:35:58,9
You've done enough.

743
00:35:59,069 --> 00:36:00,6
But...

744
00:36:01,053 --> 00:36:02,3
[doors thud]

745
00:36:14,058 --> 00:36:17,1
[baby cries]

746
00:36:18,038 --> 00:36:20,8
If I wanted to hear screaming,
I would have stayed home.

747
00:36:21,051 --> 00:36:23,4
He's just a hungry boy.

748
00:36:28,006 --> 00:36:29,2
[Dromos] Idiot.

749
00:36:29,031 --> 00:36:31,1
It's way too hot.

750
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:35,7
We don't want to burn
our itty-bitty new king.

751
00:36:36,048 --> 00:36:37,6
Just let it cool.

752
00:36:40,053 --> 00:36:42,2
He's just not used to the heat.

753
00:36:44,016 --> 00:36:44,9
Yet.

754
00:36:45,007 --> 00:36:46,6
[baby cries]

755
00:36:47,049 --> 00:36:48,5
Yeah.

756
00:36:51,004 --> 00:36:52,0
Shh.

757
00:36:55,092 --> 00:36:58,4
[Chloe] Anything I need to know
about how to fight a demon?

758
00:36:58,054 --> 00:37:01,7
[Lucifer] Not really. Just that they're
super strong, scary and mean.

759
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,7
Like Maze.

760
00:37:02,084 --> 00:37:05,8
Except these don't feel pain,
because they're only renting their bodies.

761
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:07,0
-Right.
-Good news is...

762
00:37:07,047 --> 00:37:09,7
they're killable.
Just requires a little extra oomph.

763
00:37:09,085 --> 00:37:12,8
But you don't worry about that
since you're not going inside.

764
00:37:13,018 --> 00:37:14,1
Oh, yes, I am.

765
00:37:14,056 --> 00:37:17,9
Demons or no demons,
there's no way I'm not helping.

766
00:37:17,098 --> 00:37:21,5
Need I remind you, detective,
it is less helpful if you're there.

767
00:37:21,078 --> 00:37:23,4
You make me vulnerable, remember?

768
00:37:24,065 --> 00:37:25,7
[Eve] But I don't.

769
00:37:26,045 --> 00:37:27,3
Eve.

770
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:30,2
-You're supposed to be at the penthouse.
-Right.

771
00:37:31,016 --> 00:37:34,6
But I needed to apologize...
for all of it.

772
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:38,1
And everything I've put you through.
[sniffs]

773
00:37:40,017 --> 00:37:45,1
But I realized you're not this perfect guy
I've made you out to be.

774
00:37:45,026 --> 00:37:46,7
You suck at apologies.

775
00:37:48,026 --> 00:37:49,3
What I mean is...

776
00:37:51,081 --> 00:37:54,2
I thought I wanted you,

777
00:37:54,056 --> 00:37:56,5
but I realized I've...

778
00:37:57,073 --> 00:38:00,9
just been missing the person I used to be
when I was with you.

779
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:06,5
I hope you find what you want, Eve,
but I really wish you'd had this epiphany

780
00:38:06,061 --> 00:38:08,9
before you let demons loose
on Los Angeles.

781
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:10,8
[Eve] You and me both.

782
00:38:10,099 --> 00:38:12,4
Look, I understand that...

783
00:38:13,037 --> 00:38:16,0
there's nothing I can do
to make up for what I've done.

784
00:38:17,029 --> 00:38:19,1
But I'm going to have to try, so...

785
00:38:19,083 --> 00:38:22,8
that's why there's nothing you can do
to stop me from going in there.

786
00:38:25,088 --> 00:38:26,7
Very well.

787
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:30,3
We'll just have to wait
for my brother and Maze to arrive.

788
00:38:33,056 --> 00:38:34,8
What are you doing here?

789
00:38:35,043 --> 00:38:37,8
Yes, Lucifer told us what you did.

790
00:38:37,098 --> 00:38:39,9
Put your claws away.
There's no time for that.

791
00:38:40,094 --> 00:38:42,6
We need all the help we can get.

792
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:56,6
[Dromos] Mm.

793
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:03,8
Ha! Just right.

794
00:39:24,073 --> 00:39:25,6
Dromos!

795
00:39:27,028 --> 00:39:29,9
Surely you've heard breast is best.

796
00:39:32,045 --> 00:39:33,7
[Dromos laughs]

797
00:39:35,028 --> 00:39:36,1
Now, you see...

798
00:39:36,066 --> 00:39:37,6
the thing is...

799
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:41,0
I don't take orders from you anymore.

800
00:39:42,033 --> 00:39:45,5
Not since the whole abdication thing.

801
00:39:46,013 --> 00:39:46,9
So...

802
00:39:47,055 --> 00:39:49,3
long live King Charlie.

803
00:39:51,026 --> 00:39:53,0
He's going to be a hell of a ruler.

804
00:39:54,035 --> 00:39:55,2
Pun intended.

805
00:39:56,056 --> 00:40:01,8
Because I am going to mold him
into exactly what I want.

806
00:40:02,031 --> 00:40:05,6
You know, you've got to admit
you've been a bit of a selfish king.

807
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:08,5
Keeping the whole Earth thing to yourself.

808
00:40:08,065 --> 00:40:10,1
[yells] Give me my son!

809
00:40:10,049 --> 00:40:11,6
Over my dead body.

810
00:40:12,061 --> 00:40:16,0
Oh, that's right. It's already dead, so...

811
00:40:16,095 --> 00:40:18,6
you're going to have to get creative.

812
00:40:24,029 --> 00:40:25,1
[thud]

813
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:29,6
[thud]

814
00:40:30,009 --> 00:40:32,2
[sound of blades]

815
00:40:40,072 --> 00:40:41,8
[Dromos] Come, my king.

816
00:40:54,045 --> 00:40:57,3
[Dromos] Ah! I wouldn't come any closer
if I were you.

817
00:40:57,074 --> 00:40:59,7
[sound of fighting]

818
00:41:01,054 --> 00:41:03,1
You are going to pay, Dromos.

819
00:41:04,017 --> 00:41:05,0
Really?

820
00:41:05,017 --> 00:41:06,3
My money's on me, pal.

821
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:07,7
[grunting]

822
00:41:10,063 --> 00:41:11,6
You're getting soft.

823
00:41:12,076 --> 00:41:15,3
Getting all mushy with the humans.

824
00:41:15,051 --> 00:41:16,9
It's disgusting.

825
00:41:20,006 --> 00:41:21,0

826
00:41:23,052 --> 00:41:24,8

827
00:41:24,098 --> 00:41:27,0
You're quite good at that these days.

828
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:29,0
[grunts]

829
00:41:29,011 --> 00:41:30,5
Go. Run. Run!

830
00:41:40,024 --> 00:41:41,8

831
00:41:41,091 --> 00:41:43,1

[Eve breathing heavily]

850
00:42:59,049 --> 00:43:00,7
That was amazing.

851
00:43:03,003 --> 00:43:03,9
[Chloe gasps]

852
00:43:04,095 --> 00:43:05,9

[Chloe gasps]

855
00:43:12,008 --> 00:43:13,2
Got her.

856
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:17,3
[baby cries]

857
00:43:30,077 --> 00:43:33,0
[Lucifer] There's no-one left, Dromos.

858
00:43:33,065 --> 00:43:34,6
Party's over.

859
00:43:35,073 --> 00:43:37,4
I think it's time you went home.

860
00:43:39,061 --> 00:43:40,5
Make me.

861
00:43:43,032 --> 00:43:44,2
Very well.

862
00:43:51,096 --> 00:43:53,3
[blade rings]

863
00:43:53,042 --> 00:43:55,0
Oh, look who's here.

864
00:43:58,021 --> 00:43:59,0
Shit.

865
00:44:02,018 --> 00:44:04,2
Detective, what are you doing?

866
00:44:04,035 --> 00:44:05,8
I'm sorry, I know...

867
00:44:06,026 --> 00:44:07,1
I sh--

868
00:44:07,026 --> 00:44:09,8
It sounded like everything was okay.
I just want to make sure. Are you alright?

869
00:44:09,093 --> 00:44:11,8
You need to leave, detective.

870
00:44:12,031 --> 00:44:14,7
I know... I make you vulnerable.

871
00:44:15,036 --> 00:44:16,5
No, that's not it.

872
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:19,1
I don't want you to see me like this.

873
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,4
I know it scares you.

874
00:44:21,078 --> 00:44:24,9
No, that's... that's what I was trying
to tell you. I'm not...

875
00:44:25,091 --> 00:44:27,1
I'm not afraid of you anymore.

876
00:44:27,074 --> 00:44:28,6
You're not?

877
00:44:30,004 --> 00:44:33,4
You see, this is what I'm talking about.
It's so sweet. I'm going to puke.

878
00:44:34,054 --> 00:44:36,3
[Lucifer] Then why've you been so worried?

879
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:39,5
Worried about my face,
about all of it coming back.

880
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:41,0
I wasn't afraid of you.

881
00:44:42,055 --> 00:44:43,9
I was afraid of losing you.

882
00:44:45,026 --> 00:44:48,6
That all this will take over,
you'll forget about this place and...

883
00:44:50,081 --> 00:44:52,3
And that you'd forget about me.

884
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,2
Lucifer...

885
00:44:56,015 --> 00:44:57,1

[snarling of demons]

888
00:45:01,082 --> 00:45:05,5
It's amazing how many demon souls
you can source

889
00:45:05,061 --> 00:45:07,7
from a little church confession.

No!

[groans demonically]

898
00:45:40,098 --> 00:45:42,5
You'll bow down...

899
00:45:43,099 --> 00:45:45,4
to your king.

00:45:45,053 --> 00:45:47,5
[Chloe gasps]

You do not belong here.

Go home!

I'm so sorry.

909
00:46:52,035 --> 00:46:53,2
Are you okay?

910
00:46:54,064 --> 00:46:56,0
Not that I care.

911
00:47:00,094 --> 00:47:02,1
I know that's not true.

912
00:47:04,086 --> 00:47:06,2
I think you care a lot.

913
00:47:07,028 --> 00:47:08,2
I've just been...

914
00:47:08,099 --> 00:47:10,4
too blind to notice.

915
00:47:11,045 --> 00:47:14,2
Yeah, I thought there was something
between us, but...

916
00:47:15,049 --> 00:47:16,4
Maze...

917
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:20,9
[scoffs] you're not delusional.

918
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:23,0
There is a connection.

919
00:47:24,017 --> 00:47:27,4
But I've realized
the way I've been acting with Lucifer

920
00:47:27,051 --> 00:47:30,4
is the exact same way
I've acted with Adam.

You know, I keep...

be this person I think they want me to be.

924
00:47:38,006 --> 00:47:40,2
I would never ask you to change, Eve.

925

I'm going to need to do that on my own.
