1
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,5
[lady] It'll be great for entertaining
or whatever you guys wanna do.

2
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,2
-It's just kind of the perfect house.
-[2nd lady] It's gorgeous.

3
00:00:23,031 --> 00:00:25,2
-And those marble countertops.
-Right.

4
00:00:25,031 --> 00:00:27,4
They really tie
the whole kitchen together.

5
00:00:27,052 --> 00:00:30,8
And now here's the garage,
room for two cars and storage.

6
00:00:31,015 --> 00:00:34,4
Say, the Murphy twins,
they're your older sisters, right?

7
00:00:34,095 --> 00:00:36,9
-Yes.
-It must be so amazing.

8
00:00:37,007 --> 00:00:40,7
[laughs] It really is. You know, it's nice
to be a part of a family business.

9
00:00:41,024 --> 00:00:42,3
Are they gonna come by?

10
00:00:42,045 --> 00:00:45,6
They can get pretty busy,
but sometimes they like to pop in

11
00:00:45,075 --> 00:00:47,0
and surprise people.

12
00:00:47,017 --> 00:00:50,1
And there's really nice neighbors
all around. These neighbors--

13
00:00:50,059 --> 00:00:52,4
[shocked gasps]

14
00:01:00,085 --> 00:01:01,6
Lucifer!

15
00:01:02,018 --> 00:01:03,0
Hi.

16
00:01:03,068 --> 00:01:04,5
Erm...

17
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:09,4
Listen, about everything
that you said last night.

18
00:01:09,052 --> 00:01:10,4
It doesn't matter.

19
00:01:10,052 --> 00:01:12,3
Er, I really think it does.

20
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,4
No, I'm way beyond that, detective.
You see, I've made a breakthrough.

21
00:01:15,095 --> 00:01:17,9
Really? What is it?

22
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:19,9
I hate myself.

23
00:01:21,091 --> 00:01:24,0
Well, I'm not quite sure what to do
with that,

24
00:01:24,012 --> 00:01:26,0
but it doesn't sound like a good thing.

25
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:28,0
But of course it is, detective.

26
00:01:28,008 --> 00:01:31,8
All my time with Dr. Linda has been
about exploring the denial that I'm in,

27
00:01:31,092 --> 00:01:35,4
but I've overcome that now,
I've had an honest-to-Devil epiphany.

28
00:01:35,055 --> 00:01:38,2
Now all my problems should just,
you know, go away.

29
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:40,9
Well, a new case just came in,

30
00:01:41,005 --> 00:01:43,0
but I really do wanna talk about this more
later.

31
00:01:44,002 --> 00:01:45,4
-I'm gonna grab my keys.
-Alright.

32
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:49,4
-Hey, Lucifer.
-Ah! Morning, Miss Lopez.

33
00:01:49,077 --> 00:01:50,9
Whoa!

34
00:01:51,031 --> 00:01:52,5
What's wrong with your hand?

35
00:01:52,086 --> 00:01:53,6
Mm?

36
00:01:54,032 --> 00:01:57,9
Lucifer, that is the worst case
of psoriasis I've ever seen.

37
00:01:58,049 --> 00:01:59,5
This is impossible.

38
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:01,9
I have some creams in my lab. Hold on.

39
00:02:11,021 --> 00:02:14,5
[sobbing]

40
00:02:15,021 --> 00:02:19,2
-[sobbing]
-[knife clangs]

41
00:02:21,005 --> 00:02:22,3
What are you doing?

42
00:02:22,043 --> 00:02:24,2
[ratting]

43
00:02:24,081 --> 00:02:27,1
I'm gonna punish Lucifer
for what he did to you.

44
00:02:28,031 --> 00:02:30,0
Where is my shuriken?

45
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,9
I had to hide most of my weapons
so Linda wouldn't get rid of them.

46
00:02:35,002 --> 00:02:35,8
Oh, yeah!

47
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:38,3
-[rip]
-Thanks.

48
00:02:39,036 --> 00:02:41,6
Maze, you can't hurt Lucifer.

49
00:02:42,016 --> 00:02:43,4
[metallic ring]

50
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:45,2
Oh, I definitely can.

51
00:02:45,066 --> 00:02:48,4
No, you can't hurt him because I love him.

52
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,5
[sobs] I want him back.

53
00:02:51,012 --> 00:02:53,6
I just don't understand
why he would say that...

54
00:02:54,071 --> 00:02:56,9
he doesn't love himself
when he is with me.

55
00:02:57,001 --> 00:02:58,8
What does that even mean?

56
00:02:58,092 --> 00:03:00,5
[Maze] It means,

57
00:03:00,059 --> 00:03:01,5
he is an idiot,

58
00:03:02,034 --> 00:03:04,1
which is typical for Lucifer.

59
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,1
Not realizing how lucky he is.

60
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:09,8
[sniffs]

61
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:10,8
Thanks.

62
00:03:12,044 --> 00:03:14,0
[Eve sighs, sniffs]

63
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:17,4
How do I get him back?

64
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,2
[sighs]

65
00:03:20,032 --> 00:03:21,9
Lucifer is like any other man.

66
00:03:22,078 --> 00:03:24,2
He wants what he can't have.

67
00:03:24,091 --> 00:03:25,8
Okay.

68
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,3
Okay...

69
00:03:30,004 --> 00:03:34,8
I can do that. You know,
I just need to show him that I'm fine.

70
00:03:34,092 --> 00:03:36,9
You know, that I'm fine without him.

71
00:03:38,038 --> 00:03:40,0
-[crying] I can do that.
-Yeah.

72
00:03:41,026 --> 00:03:43,8
[crying] Okay, maybe I can't do that.
Okay.

73
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:44,7
[sniffs]

74
00:03:45,072 --> 00:03:46,8
Unless you help me.

75
00:03:48,068 --> 00:03:50,3
-Please!
-Well...

76
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,3
In the old days,

77
00:03:54,015 --> 00:03:58,2
I could just enter your body
and take over.

78
00:03:58,086 --> 00:04:03,1
Um... demons used to be able
to possess humans.

79
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,1
But only when they'd just died.
But then Lucifer forbade it.

80
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:07,3
Why?

81
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:08,9
Above my pay grade.

82
00:04:09,012 --> 00:04:11,5
Must have pissed off someone
in the Silver City.

83
00:04:11,058 --> 00:04:13,0
[laughs]
It was fun, though.

84
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:17,6
The looks on their faces
when you pop up and be "Rah!"

85
00:04:17,071 --> 00:04:19,5
[laughs]

86
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,0
[sighs, laughs]

87
00:04:22,051 --> 00:04:24,4
[giggles]

88
00:04:27,093 --> 00:04:31,1
But it'd have to be coming from Hell, Eve,
so no luck there.

89
00:04:31,056 --> 00:04:32,4
Mm.

90
00:04:33,027 --> 00:04:34,1
[Eve sighs]

91
00:04:34,031 --> 00:04:36,4
We'll have to do this
the old fashioned way.

92
00:04:36,073 --> 00:04:37,6
What is that?

93
00:04:38,036 --> 00:04:40,1
You're gonna get your shit together.

94
00:04:41,007 --> 00:04:44,1
And then we are gonna go
and rub in Lucifer's face

95
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,3
just how much you don't...

96
00:04:47,003 --> 00:04:48,0
need him.

97
00:04:51,012 --> 00:04:57,4
[playing Tall Days: "All In My Way"]

98
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,1
[Chloe] Thank you.

99
00:05:12,006 --> 00:05:14,7
Since when do you voluntarily wear
evidence gloves?

100
00:05:14,085 --> 00:05:16,8
Detective, it's... well, I...

101
00:05:17,044 --> 00:05:19,6
This is about the other night, isn't it?

102
00:05:20,015 --> 00:05:21,6
Lucifer, I don't want you to feel

103
00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:24,4
like you have to be someone you're not
when you are around me.

104
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:27,4
And if this is part of the reason
why you think you hate yourself--

105
00:05:27,049 --> 00:05:29,5
No need to worry on that front, detective.

106
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:33,5
All my self-hatred is also self-inflicted.
No one to blame but myself on that.

107
00:05:34,025 --> 00:05:37,6
But I still don't see how this epiphany
solves anything.

108
00:05:37,075 --> 00:05:39,0
-[Lucifer sighs]
-[Ella] Stop!

109
00:05:40,021 --> 00:05:42,3
-"Hammer time!"
-[camera shutter clicks]

110
00:05:43,096 --> 00:05:45,8
'Cause she was killed with a hammer!

111
00:05:46,005 --> 00:05:48,3
Come on, guys,
I've been waiting years to do that one.

112
00:05:48,093 --> 00:05:50,0
[Ella] Anyway.

113
00:05:50,035 --> 00:05:52,6
Victim's name is Megan Murphy, 34.

114
00:05:52,076 --> 00:05:54,7
-One half--
-[Chloe] Of the Murphy Twins.

115
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:58,0
Yeah, they're local celebrities
for their twin shtick.

116
00:05:58,023 --> 00:06:00,9
-Any suspects?
-The other twin, actually. Moira.

117
00:06:01,006 --> 00:06:03,1
She was found standing over the body,
hammer in hand.

118
00:06:03,052 --> 00:06:05,1
She bolted after eyewitnesses saw her.

119
00:06:05,023 --> 00:06:07,3
We have a BOLO out,
but no luck finding her yet.

120
00:06:07,053 --> 00:06:10,1
The realtor who found the body
was the twins' younger sister, Beth.

121
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,4
And according to interviews,

122
00:06:11,049 --> 00:06:13,9
Beth wasn't aware of any tension
between the sisters.

123
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:16,9
Sometimes there's a darkness
waiting just under the surface.

124
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:20,0
-Waiting for a chance to emerge--
-You can't touch this!

125
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:22,1
Yes, I get it.
It's the lyrics to the song.

126
00:06:22,038 --> 00:06:25,2
No, it's because I haven't bagged it yet
and you never wear gloves.

127
00:06:25,088 --> 00:06:27,3
Wait, you're wearing gloves.

128
00:06:27,063 --> 00:06:29,2
-Did the cream not work?
-Cream?

129
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:32,6
[sound of motorbike approaching]

130
00:06:36,002 --> 00:06:37,1
You know what this is?

131
00:06:37,056 --> 00:06:38,7
Haven't a clue.

132
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:52,1
[Maze] Heard you got a suspect on the run.
We'll catch her in no time.

133
00:06:52,024 --> 00:06:54,0
We?
What, you two are working together now?

134
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,1
Yeah.

135
00:06:55,024 --> 00:06:56,2
We're partners.

136
00:06:56,091 --> 00:07:00,3
She's got a natural talent
for hunting bounties.

137
00:07:00,046 --> 00:07:03,0
Er, don't you need an actual bounty
to be put out?

138
00:07:03,013 --> 00:07:04,6
Because right now there isn't one.

139
00:07:04,084 --> 00:07:07,6
Like to get a head start
on the competition, Chloe.

140
00:07:07,076 --> 00:07:09,1
[sighs] Eve.

141
00:07:10,005 --> 00:07:11,9
There was no need to make a scene
at my work.

142
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:13,5
I'm not!

143
00:07:17,068 --> 00:07:18,6
Listen...

144
00:07:19,023 --> 00:07:20,0
Luce...

145
00:07:20,044 --> 00:07:21,4
What you said...

146
00:07:22,044 --> 00:07:23,8
hurt a lot,

147
00:07:24,006 --> 00:07:27,7
but I really think that the break-up was
the best thing that's ever happened to me.

148
00:07:28,044 --> 00:07:29,9
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

149
00:07:30,095 --> 00:07:33,0
I'm having more fun than ever with Maze.

150
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,4
I think it's exactly what I needed.

151
00:07:35,095 --> 00:07:37,9
Well, that's wonderful news.

152
00:07:38,016 --> 00:07:39,1
[Maze] Come on, Eve.

153
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:42,0
We've got a murderous twin to catch.

154
00:07:42,037 --> 00:07:43,5
Sounds fun. [sighs]

155
00:07:48,096 --> 00:07:49,9
How did I do?

156
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:53,3
Pretty damn good, lady.
[chuckles]

157
00:07:53,043 --> 00:07:55,6
Is he still looking?
I bet you he's still--

158
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,2
Detective, I need to talk to you inside,
now!

159
00:07:59,014 --> 00:07:59,9
Okay.

160
00:08:00,043 --> 00:08:02,4

[motorbike starts and leaves]

162
00:08:06,061 --> 00:08:08,4
Detective, I'm afraid you were right.

163
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:10,9
Things aren't as simple as I thought.

164
00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:13,2
In fact, my epiphany may have backfired
on me.

165
00:08:13,032 --> 00:08:14,3
What do you mean?

166
00:08:18,003 --> 00:08:19,4
[gasps, sniffs]

167
00:08:20,075 --> 00:08:23,9
-Is that how your face gets--
-Yes.

168
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:27,1
Though "devil hand" doesn't have
quite the same ring to it.

169
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:29,5
Detective, this hasn't happened to me
before.

170
00:08:29,067 --> 00:08:31,8
It's going to be okay.
We'll figure it out.

171
00:08:32,063 --> 00:08:35,9
Put the glove back on and I'm sure
it will go away in no time.

172
00:08:36,001 --> 00:08:37,3
That's just it, detective!

173
00:08:37,043 --> 00:08:39,6
It started out as a patch of skin,
but now...

174
00:08:40,035 --> 00:08:41,3
it's spreading.

175
00:08:51,086 --> 00:08:52,6
[door rattles]

176
00:08:53,053 --> 00:08:54,7
This is all your fault.

177
00:08:54,095 --> 00:08:56,2
You and your epiphanies.

178
00:08:56,061 --> 00:08:59,5
Turns out self-help is actually self-harm.

179
00:08:59,066 --> 00:09:03,5
Hey, Lucifer, it's okay to be afraid.
That means we're making progress.

180
00:09:03,066 --> 00:09:08,2
Oh, we're making progress
in precisely the wrong direction.

181
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:09,9
Oh, Lucifer!

182
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:12,0
What's happening to you?

183
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,8
Exactly what I'd like to find out,
and quickly,

184
00:09:13,097 --> 00:09:17,5
because I can't walk around
like O. J. bloody Simpson forever.

185
00:09:17,097 --> 00:09:18,9
[Linda groans]

186
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:20,1
[sighs]

187
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:23,1
Thank you for feeling my pain.
At least it’s not my wanking ha--

188
00:09:23,018 --> 00:09:25,4
[Linda groans]

189
00:09:25,052 --> 00:09:28,0
Please tell me you are not giving birth
to that child now.

190
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:31,1
[gasps] No, no. I'm not due
for another couple of weeks.

191
00:09:31,027 --> 00:09:34,4
[gasps]
It's just Braxton Hicks contractions. Ah!

192
00:09:35,049 --> 00:09:37,6
Doesn't mean they don't hurt
like a son of a--

193
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,5
Alright.

194
00:09:39,057 --> 00:09:40,9
-Better.
-Good.

195
00:09:41,016 --> 00:09:42,2
So.

196
00:09:43,012 --> 00:09:45,0
[sighs]
We know subconsciously...

197
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:48,4
you control what happens to your own body.

198
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,2
So, some part of you is reacting
to this revelation.

199
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,4
Yes, and it doesn't seem thrilled,

200
00:09:55,055 --> 00:09:58,2
so if you could just de-enlighten me,
that'd be lovely, thank you.

201
00:09:58,034 --> 00:10:02,3
Look, Lucifer, I think you need
to step forward, not backward.

202
00:10:03,006 --> 00:10:04,5
You need to dig deeper.

203
00:10:05,068 --> 00:10:07,5
If you really hate yourself...

204
00:10:08,023 --> 00:10:09,9
you need to figure out why.

205
00:10:11,015 --> 00:10:11,9
[sighs]

206
00:10:12,006 --> 00:10:18,8
[playing David Luning: "In Hell I Am"]

207
00:10:19,003 --> 00:10:19,9
[Lucifer] Daniel.

208
00:10:20,049 --> 00:10:21,7
I've had a realization.

209
00:10:22,058 --> 00:10:24,9
-I really don't care, man.
-I hate myself.

210
00:10:28,004 --> 00:10:28,9
Okay.

211
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,1
What's the punch line?

212
00:10:32,029 --> 00:10:33,9
Well, me, apparently.

213
00:10:34,005 --> 00:10:36,6
Because I haven't the foggiest idea why.
Look at me!

214
00:10:37,001 --> 00:10:39,0
Why would I ever hate me?

215
00:10:39,043 --> 00:10:40,2
[chuckles]

216
00:10:40,051 --> 00:10:43,7
-I might have some ideas.
-Which is exactly why I've come to you.

217
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,0
So please tell me more.

218
00:10:45,064 --> 00:10:48,8
Er... well,
you don't take anything seriously.

219
00:10:50,027 --> 00:10:51,4
You get away with everything,

220
00:10:51,065 --> 00:10:54,5
-make everything about yourself.
-Yes, Daniel, I know all that.

221
00:10:54,061 --> 00:10:56,9
Please, just dig deeper into your cold...

222
00:10:57,094 --> 00:10:58,7
douchy heart.

223
00:11:02,016 --> 00:11:04,4
You are the reason
Charlotte Richards is dead.

224
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:06,8
Daniel...

225
00:11:08,045 --> 00:11:12,0
I need reasons that are actually my fault,
not excuses.

226
00:11:12,058 --> 00:11:15,0
I should have known
you'd be spectacularly useless.

227
00:11:17,042 --> 00:11:18,2
[bang]

228
00:11:22,076 --> 00:11:24,1
So, Moira's on the run.

229
00:11:24,022 --> 00:11:27,1
We have contacted family,
friends, co-workers, nothing.

230
00:11:27,068 --> 00:11:29,1
Still no luck on the BOLO.

231
00:11:29,081 --> 00:11:33,6
So, if you were caught standing
over the dead body of your twin sister,

232
00:11:33,073 --> 00:11:34,7
where would you run to?

233
00:11:34,086 --> 00:11:37,8
I would run and run. And never look back.

234
00:11:38,007 --> 00:11:41,2
I mean, she literally killed someone
with her exact same face.

235
00:11:41,074 --> 00:11:44,3
-How do you do that?
-You'd have to hate yourself.

236
00:11:46,012 --> 00:11:47,4
Hello!

237
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:49,0
Detective...

238
00:11:49,062 --> 00:11:52,0
this woman may have the answer
to my current dilemma,

239
00:11:52,016 --> 00:11:53,9
we need to find her immediately.

240
00:11:54,021 --> 00:11:56,1
Sort of what we're trying to do here,
Lucifer.

241
00:11:56,042 --> 00:11:59,0
So, Moira's phone record finally came in.

242
00:11:59,013 --> 00:12:01,8
First call she made after the murder...
her accountant.

243
00:12:02,063 --> 00:12:05,5
Oh. If I needed money to skip town,
that's who I'd call.

244
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:08,1
-Let's go talk to him.
-Quickly, we can't waste a moment.

245
00:12:09,001 --> 00:12:10,3
Move!

246
00:12:13,073 --> 00:12:15,4
Am I sexier like this...

247
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,2
or...

248
00:12:20,053 --> 00:12:21,4
like this?

249
00:12:21,082 --> 00:12:22,7
Er...

250
00:12:23,065 --> 00:12:24,5
[laughs]

251
00:12:24,074 --> 00:12:26,2
I don't know. Yeah.

252
00:12:28,058 --> 00:12:29,4
What do you think?

253
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:32,3
Oh!

254
00:12:32,071 --> 00:12:34,6
Maybe this isn't going to work.

255
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,5
Where are they, anyway?

256
00:12:36,063 --> 00:12:38,5
They got the same phone records we did.

257
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,3
I promise they will be here.

258
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:43,9
Okay, okay. [sighs]

259
00:12:45,068 --> 00:12:46,6
[Eve] Okay.

260
00:12:47,005 --> 00:12:49,5
[Maze] What about dating someone else?

261
00:12:49,097 --> 00:12:50,8
Someone...

262
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,5
not Lucifer?

263
00:12:57,019 --> 00:12:58,3
Oh, my God!

264
00:12:59,006 --> 00:12:59,9
[gasps]

265
00:13:00,036 --> 00:13:01,8
You're right!

266
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:03,8
-Yeah?
-Yeah!

267
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,1
Of course!

268
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,6
Nothing better to get his jealousy going

269
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:10,4
than to see me happy
with someone else, of course!

270
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,3
How about that detective he hates so much?

271
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,2
You know...

272
00:13:15,046 --> 00:13:16,2
Don?

273
00:13:17,033 --> 00:13:18,3
The douchy one.

274
00:13:18,046 --> 00:13:19,3
-Dan!
-Or...

275
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:24,0
Maybe you deserve better.

276
00:13:24,076 --> 00:13:25,6
Like who?

277
00:13:33,064 --> 00:13:35,8
-[Eve murmurs]
-[kissing]

278
00:13:38,015 --> 00:13:39,8
-[Eve murmurs]
-[kissing]

279
00:13:40,002 --> 00:13:41,2
[Lucifer calls out]

280
00:13:41,098 --> 00:13:43,1
-[door rasps]
-Ah!

281
00:13:43,028 --> 00:13:44,1
[kissing]

282
00:13:45,015 --> 00:13:47,1
Oh. Hi, guys.

283
00:13:47,024 --> 00:13:48,1
Hi!

284
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,8
Didn't see you there.

285
00:13:51,045 --> 00:13:52,3
Ah.

286
00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:54,3
Sure didn't.

287
00:13:54,045 --> 00:13:56,3
[man] Mm!

288
00:13:57,058 --> 00:13:58,4
[Eve sighs]

289
00:14:02,038 --> 00:14:05,1
Oh! Did you see his face?

290
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:08,5
You are a genius. Of course!

291
00:14:08,063 --> 00:14:12,4
Being with you would make him
super-jealous. Oh, my God! Thank you!

292
00:14:12,056 --> 00:14:13,3
[Eve sighs]

293
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:14,8
You're welcome.

294
00:14:15,085 --> 00:14:16,8
[pained shout]

295
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:17,7
Thank you!

296
00:14:18,002 --> 00:14:21,1
These two maniacs barged in here
and tied me up!

297
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,5
Yes, I can see you've had
a most unpleasant time so far.

298
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:26,7
Well, it wasn't all bad.

299
00:14:27,011 --> 00:14:29,2
-Back to--
-I need you to focus.

300
00:14:29,082 --> 00:14:32,9
Tell me,
why did Moira hate herself so much?

301
00:14:33,003 --> 00:14:35,1
Hate herself? She didn't hate herself.

302
00:14:35,024 --> 00:14:37,9
She must have, she literally killed
a mirror image of herself.

303
00:14:38,004 --> 00:14:39,2
I need to understand why.

304
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:41,6
She called you after the murder.
What did she want?

305
00:14:41,071 --> 00:14:43,0
Well, that's the thing.

306
00:14:44,059 --> 00:14:47,1
She called to accuse me of killing Megan.

307
00:14:49,017 --> 00:14:51,3
Why would Moira accuse you of murder?

308
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,3
I tried to ask her that,
but then she hung up on me.

309
00:14:54,089 --> 00:14:57,1
I love those girls.
They're like family to me.

310
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:58,9
[Maze] Less motive, more location.

311
00:14:59,018 --> 00:15:00,8
Where is she? Or I gag you again.

312
00:15:01,098 --> 00:15:05,4
No, you will not. And we're gonna talk
about proper procedure later on.

313
00:15:06,048 --> 00:15:11,1
Um, they owned a lot of properties.
Maybe Moira is at one of those?

314
00:15:11,032 --> 00:15:12,7
I can get you the address.

315
00:15:13,007 --> 00:15:13,9
Great.

316
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:16,3
[cabinet closes]

317
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,3
Sorry you had to see that.

318
00:15:21,008 --> 00:15:23,2
What? Oh, the snogging.

319
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,0
No need to apologize for a bit of fun.

320
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:27,0
Well...

321
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:30,5
when the lightning strikes,
it strikes, I guess.

322
00:15:30,076 --> 00:15:35,3
Oh. So what? You're saying
that you and Maze are together together?

323
00:15:36,043 --> 00:15:39,3
I was just looking for the right time
to tell you.

324
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,6
Well, all I care is that you are happy,
Eve.

325
00:15:42,098 --> 00:15:43,9
Genuinely.

326
00:15:45,006 --> 00:15:47,1
-Are you, though?
-Why wouldn't I be?

327
00:15:47,061 --> 00:15:50,5
[Chloe] Did Megan do anything strange
before she was murdered?

328
00:15:50,061 --> 00:15:52,6
Anything to help us figure out
who killed her?

329
00:15:53,016 --> 00:15:54,2
Her sister killed her.

330
00:15:54,091 --> 00:15:57,5
Maybe, but murderers don't often use
their first phone call

331
00:15:57,066 --> 00:15:58,9
to accuse someone else.

332
00:15:59,045 --> 00:16:01,9
Megan took over her company's finances
a couple of months ago.

333
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:03,2
Is that normal?

334
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:06,5
I figured that she wanted
to be more involved in the business.

335
00:16:06,067 --> 00:16:08,4
But, then, two days ago,

336
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:12,5
she dropped off a thumb drive
with a copy of her financial files.

337
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:14,3
Which isn't strange, but...

338
00:16:15,034 --> 00:16:17,3
she did seem upset.

339
00:16:17,055 --> 00:16:19,4
Did you notice anything odd in the files?

340
00:16:19,056 --> 00:16:22,5
I haven't looked, but the thumb drive
is in the filing cabinet.

341
00:16:22,089 --> 00:16:24,1
-Can I see it?
-Sure.

342
00:16:24,098 --> 00:16:27,1
[Lucifer] Of course I'm fine.
Why wouldn't I be?

343
00:16:29,002 --> 00:16:31,6
[Lucifer] You and Maze...
it's just a bit surprising.

344
00:16:31,099 --> 00:16:34,7
Well, if you think someone else
would make me happier...

345
00:16:35,057 --> 00:16:38,1
-then maybe--
-Hey, Lucifer!

346
00:16:38,024 --> 00:16:41,2
-You look cold.
-Detective, I know I'm wearing gloves,

347
00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:43,9
-but it's actually rather warm--
-No. It's best you stay covered up.

348
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:47,7
Oh! Right.
Always so thoughtful, detective.

349
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,5
[accountant] Detective,
there seems to be a problem.

350
00:16:52,076 --> 00:16:54,4
-What is it?
-The thumb drive's missing.

351
00:16:56,026 --> 00:16:57,6
Someone must have stolen it.

352
00:17:02,077 --> 00:17:05,0
[Amenadiel]
What about the name Zoriel?

353
00:17:05,044 --> 00:17:07,2
That's a good name for a warrior.

354
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:09,5
We can call him Zori for short.

355
00:17:10,086 --> 00:17:12,4
Or Ezekiel.

356
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:13,5
Zek.

357
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,8
Yeah.

358
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:18,5
Erm... I was thinking about the name...

359
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:20,9
Jack.

360
00:17:21,062 --> 00:17:22,5
Mm.

361
00:17:23,058 --> 00:17:24,4
Mm.

362
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,5
Short for Jackiel.

363
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,0
We could definitely put that on the list.

364
00:17:31,046 --> 00:17:32,7
Right after Azmortiel.

365
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:35,6
I was hoping for a more mainstream name.

366
00:17:36,005 --> 00:17:39,6
Our child is going to have
enough challenges considering his nature.

367
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,7
All these names are very mainstream
in the Silver City, Linda.

368
00:17:43,097 --> 00:17:46,6
But that's not where he is going
to be living, is it?

369
00:17:47,085 --> 00:17:48,7
No.

370
00:17:50,044 --> 00:17:51,4
No, of course not.

371
00:17:52,011 --> 00:17:53,8
But I suppose he could visit.

372
00:17:54,023 --> 00:17:56,6
You could fly him up and back down
on holidays.

373
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,0
Do you guys have holidays?

374
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:02,2
No, not really.

375
00:18:03,033 --> 00:18:04,5
But that sounds great.

376
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,6
-What about Michael?
-No.

377
00:18:07,066 --> 00:18:09,1
Definitely not Michael.

378
00:18:09,042 --> 00:18:10,7
Let's keep looking, then.

379
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:11,6
Okay.

380
00:18:14,055 --> 00:18:18,9
Ah! Sorry I'm late, detective. I had
to run home to replace your ghastly scarf.

381
00:18:19,005 --> 00:18:21,7
One thing I refuse to hate about myself
is my style.

382
00:18:23,047 --> 00:18:25,6
Did you think I was Chloe?
[laughs]

383
00:18:26,048 --> 00:18:27,8
Easy mistake, I guess.

384
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:30,0
We are both thoughtful...

385
00:18:30,052 --> 00:18:32,7
-smart--
-Okay, where is the detective?

386
00:18:33,019 --> 00:18:35,7
You haven't murdered her
and assumed her identity, have you?

387
00:18:35,082 --> 00:18:37,7
[sighing] Lucifer... no.

388
00:18:38,028 --> 00:18:40,2
Maze and I brought in the runaway twin.

389
00:18:40,032 --> 00:18:43,1
I believe Chloe is interrogating her
as we speak.

390
00:18:43,066 --> 00:18:44,4
Great.

391
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:46,6
Okay. I'll...

392
00:18:47,033 --> 00:18:49,5
-I'll go and join her in there.
-Great.

393
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,9
I'll just be here, working on the case,

394
00:18:52,004 --> 00:18:54,5
looking for bad guys to bring in
to justice.

395
00:18:55,075 --> 00:18:56,7
Mm-hmm.

396
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,6
[door clicks]

397
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:06,6
Ah, there she is.

398
00:19:07,018 --> 00:19:09,7
-The answer to all my questions.
-Lucifer--

399
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:12,6
Tell me, Moira.
Did killing your sister make it go away?

400
00:19:12,098 --> 00:19:15,9
-What?
-Your self-hatred, of course.

401
00:19:15,098 --> 00:19:18,9
If so, do you think if I made a dummy
of myself and murdered it,

402
00:19:19,007 --> 00:19:20,1
it might work for me?

403
00:19:20,049 --> 00:19:21,8
What are you talking about?

404
00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:24,7
I didn't kill Megan.

405
00:19:25,053 --> 00:19:26,3
Uh?

406
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:30,8
[Moira] Two days ago, I got a notice
of an overdraft on our corporate account.

407
00:19:31,071 --> 00:19:32,7
I called Megan,

408
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:35,4
because she handles more
of the financial side.

409
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:37,1
She is the smarter one.

410
00:19:37,021 --> 00:19:41,9
Ah, so you hated your own lack
of intelligence and took it out on her!

411
00:19:42,005 --> 00:19:45,0
It's not particularly relevant to myself,
but, perhaps...

412
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:46,5
Moira, please go ahead.

413
00:19:47,068 --> 00:19:49,3
Megan told me it was no big deal.

414
00:19:51,006 --> 00:19:54,4
I could tell something was wrong,
but I just figured she'd handle it.

415
00:19:55,036 --> 00:19:56,2
Yesterday...

416
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:59,0
I knew we were showing a house, so I went.

417
00:19:59,069 --> 00:20:00,9
But I found Megan...

418
00:20:02,057 --> 00:20:03,7
dead on the ground.

419
00:20:04,087 --> 00:20:06,8
I picked up the hammer. It was instinct.

420
00:20:07,003 --> 00:20:08,9
But then I saw Beth staring at me,

421
00:20:08,099 --> 00:20:11,9
looking at me like...
like I killed our own sister.

422
00:20:12,033 --> 00:20:14,0
[Chloe] But... but you ran.

423
00:20:14,021 --> 00:20:18,1
If you are innocent, why not just explain
to Beth that you didn't do it?

424
00:20:18,025 --> 00:20:19,7
Because I looked so guilty!

425
00:20:21,022 --> 00:20:24,2
I figured I had to find out
who the real killer was.

426
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:26,0
That's why I called Willy.

427
00:20:26,018 --> 00:20:28,3
He claims that Megan took over
the financials

428
00:20:28,047 --> 00:20:30,8
for the last couple of months, so...
[sighs]

429
00:20:30,089 --> 00:20:32,8
Maybe someone else had access to them?

430
00:20:35,056 --> 00:20:36,5
Megan's husband.

431
00:20:37,048 --> 00:20:39,6
Arnold. Oh, God, it could've been him.

432
00:20:39,094 --> 00:20:42,5
Arnold. Okay, good,
we will bring him in and...

433
00:20:45,007 --> 00:20:46,1
Excuse me.

434
00:20:49,053 --> 00:20:50,9
Lucifer, look at this.

435
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:54,0
Detective, please, we both know I'm not
a paper trail kind of crime solver.

436
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:57,1
-Is something wrong with his eyes?
-Look again!

437
00:20:57,025 --> 00:20:59,5
-[Moira] Mm?
-Mm-mm, no, no.

438
00:20:59,067 --> 00:21:02,9
He just was up all night
going over the case, he is...

439
00:21:03,072 --> 00:21:04,6
tired.

440
00:21:05,009 --> 00:21:06,7
We will be right back, Moira.

441
00:21:09,055 --> 00:21:10,4
[horn honks]

442
00:21:11,022 --> 00:21:12,8
[keys rattle]

443
00:21:17,081 --> 00:21:18,6
[alarm beeps]

444
00:21:19,056 --> 00:21:20,4
[door clicks]

445
00:21:22,069 --> 00:21:23,5
[sighs]

446
00:21:24,019 --> 00:21:25,9
-[Maze] Dan!
-Oh, my!

447
00:21:26,015 --> 00:21:26,9
[gun clicks]

448
00:21:27,099 --> 00:21:28,8
[sighs]

449
00:21:29,003 --> 00:21:29,9
Maze?

450
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,8
Hey.

451
00:21:31,091 --> 00:21:33,5
[sighs]

452
00:21:34,016 --> 00:21:35,6
What the hell you doing here?

453
00:21:36,067 --> 00:21:37,8
Just getting some air.

454
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,8
Right.

455
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,3
Air.

456
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:44,5
In the backseat of my car
that is parked in a garage.

457
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:47,5
[sighs]

458
00:21:48,072 --> 00:21:49,8
Look, I'm sorry...

459
00:21:51,022 --> 00:21:53,1
about what I said to you...

460
00:21:53,056 --> 00:21:55,8
at Lux the other night. I was just drunk.

461
00:21:55,093 --> 00:21:57,9
Dealing... with a lot.

462
00:22:00,044 --> 00:22:01,4
I still am, but...

463
00:22:02,061 --> 00:22:04,1
I didn't mean what I said.

464
00:22:06,057 --> 00:22:07,5
Don't worry about it.

465
00:22:09,045 --> 00:22:10,5
Wait a minute.

466
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:13,9
I was right about you and Eve, wasn't I?

467
00:22:14,008 --> 00:22:14,9
No!

468
00:22:18,025 --> 00:22:19,1
But...

469
00:22:19,042 --> 00:22:21,5
why did you think that?

470
00:22:22,084 --> 00:22:25,7
Because I've never seen you look
at anyone the way you looked at her.

471
00:22:26,042 --> 00:22:28,2
Like you weren't thinking
about stabbing them.

472
00:22:28,084 --> 00:22:29,6
[chuckles]

473
00:22:31,043 --> 00:22:32,8
Can I give you some advice?

474
00:22:34,077 --> 00:22:35,7
No.

475
00:22:36,018 --> 00:22:38,1
I only had a few weeks with Charlotte.

476
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:42,1
But we could've had so much more time
together if I hadn't waited.

477
00:22:43,057 --> 00:22:45,3
And I wish I had that time back.

478
00:22:45,098 --> 00:22:47,8
Don't make the same mistake I made.

479
00:22:49,015 --> 00:22:51,5
If you have feelings for her,
you gotta tell her.

480
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:55,4
I kind of tried that, you know.
It kind of backfired.

481
00:22:55,058 --> 00:22:56,9
So find a way to show her.

482
00:22:58,058 --> 00:23:00,0
Grand gesture and all that.

483
00:23:00,075 --> 00:23:02,0
What do you have to lose?

484
00:23:03,084 --> 00:23:04,6
[sighs]

485
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:07,9
[elevator beeps, rattles]

486
00:23:09,009 --> 00:23:09,9
[gasps]

487
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:14,0
Here you go.

488
00:23:15,043 --> 00:23:17,6
Is that the husband
with a high-priced lawyer to boot?

489
00:23:17,072 --> 00:23:19,0
That bodes well for his guilt.

490
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,8
Well, he denied everything

491
00:23:20,094 --> 00:23:23,6
and the search warrant for the house
didn't yield any information.

492
00:23:23,073 --> 00:23:27,4
Ah, so it is the sister. Killed the twin
and ran off with the evidence.

493
00:23:27,053 --> 00:23:29,1
No, we just got the time of death back.

494
00:23:29,028 --> 00:23:32,9
Megan died 30 minutes before Moira
was found standing over the body.

495
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,1
So she either stopped to admire her work--

496
00:23:35,024 --> 00:23:36,4
Or it isn't her.

497
00:23:36,074 --> 00:23:39,8
-Does the husband have an alibi?
-No, he's still our best suspect.

498
00:23:39,091 --> 00:23:42,9
Megan's laptop is missing and he did have
easy access to that, so,

499
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:45,0
maybe he was stealing money
from their company.

500
00:23:45,009 --> 00:23:47,0
Maybe she caught him
and they got into a fight.

501
00:23:47,013 --> 00:23:49,9
And after a little brutal murder,
he ran off with the evidence.

502
00:23:50,005 --> 00:23:52,6
Yeah. We're still trying to get
the husband's financial records

503
00:23:52,072 --> 00:23:54,4
to see if he spent
a lot of money recently,

504
00:23:54,051 --> 00:23:56,9
but his lawyer is stonewalling.
Er, Lucifer...

505
00:23:57,043 --> 00:23:59,8
What is Eve doing sitting at my desk?

506
00:24:00,035 --> 00:24:02,5
Detective, I was going
through the case and--

507
00:24:02,064 --> 00:24:03,4
Listen, Eve.

508
00:24:03,056 --> 00:24:06,0
If you want to dress like me, that's fine.

509
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:07,7
Weird, but fine.

510
00:24:07,086 --> 00:24:11,3
But this is an official LAPD case file.

511
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:14,0
I think I know how to catch the killer.

512
00:24:16,028 --> 00:24:18,2
Okay, ten seconds, go.

513
00:24:19,016 --> 00:24:22,9
Whoever stole the thumb drive
was obviously covering their tracks.

514
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,2
-Right?
-Right.

515
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:27,9
So clearly,
there's something in that file

516
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,7
that can help us catch the killer.

517
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:32,8
But Willy never made a copy
of the thumb drive.

518
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:34,8
But what if he did?

519
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:36,9
-Er, he didn't.
-What if he did?

520
00:24:37,085 --> 00:24:41,5
Well, he didn't,
but if we claimed to have a copy of it...

521
00:24:41,068 --> 00:24:43,9
-And then stage a sting.
-Yeah.

522
00:24:44,027 --> 00:24:46,6
[Eve] Have Moira tell the family

523
00:24:46,077 --> 00:24:49,9
that she is selling off the company
to a wealthy buyer...

524
00:24:50,044 --> 00:24:54,3
And then we have Moira
present the fake copy of the financials

525
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,9
to Lucifer, at a party at Lux.

526
00:24:56,007 --> 00:24:58,7
[Lucifer] Then just sit back
and wait for the husband to steal them.

527
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,1
You know...

528
00:25:00,049 --> 00:25:03,1
that's a very good idea, Eve.

529
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:04,5
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

530
00:25:05,042 --> 00:25:06,2
[short sigh]

531
00:25:07,029 --> 00:25:08,6
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

532
00:25:10,025 --> 00:25:11,2
Yes...

533
00:25:12,051 --> 00:25:13,3
well done...

534
00:25:14,001 --> 00:25:15,0
detective.

535
00:25:15,063 --> 00:25:17,1
-[Eve clears throat]
-[sighs]

536
00:25:23,064 --> 00:25:24,5
[bell rings]

537
00:25:26,073 --> 00:25:27,9
Lucifer, where are you?

538
00:25:28,098 --> 00:25:32,0
The party started downstairs.
The husband should be here soon.

539
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,2
I'm not going, detective.

540
00:25:35,053 --> 00:25:36,3
Mm?

541
00:25:39,028 --> 00:25:43,5
I thought this case would help me
understand my self-hatred,

542
00:25:44,008 --> 00:25:45,8
stop what's happening to me, but...

543
00:25:46,071 --> 00:25:48,4
I think it's time I face the truth.

544
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,9
What truth?

545
00:25:51,004 --> 00:25:52,6
The prophecy, it's coming true.

546
00:25:54,063 --> 00:25:57,1
"Evil will be released," right?

547
00:25:58,034 --> 00:25:59,4
Well.

548
00:25:59,089 --> 00:26:01,3
The only question that remains

549
00:26:01,047 --> 00:26:04,5
is what kind of monster will I be
when it's done releasing?

550
00:26:06,014 --> 00:26:09,5
Lucifer, I'm going to have Father Kinley
transferred to our holding cell.

551
00:26:09,081 --> 00:26:12,4
If anyone knows more
about the prophecy, it's him.

552
00:26:13,023 --> 00:26:14,8
It will take a couple of hours,

553
00:26:15,024 --> 00:26:16,7
but we will figure this out.

554
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,3
Okay?

555
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:21,4
Until then, I think it's best
to keep you distracted.

556
00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:23,5
I can't go downstairs, detective.

557
00:26:23,095 --> 00:26:25,9
Between my sunglasses, scarf and gloves,

558
00:26:26,004 --> 00:26:27,9
I'll look like Stevie Wonder
on a snow day.

559
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:34,5
Don't worry. I got you covered.

560
00:26:44,056 --> 00:26:46,0
[Lucifer] A masquerade party.

561
00:26:46,064 --> 00:26:47,4
Clever.

562
00:26:51,044 --> 00:26:54,5
Detective, you were right.
This is exactly what I needed.

563
00:26:54,077 --> 00:26:55,6
Thank you.

564
00:26:57,069 --> 00:27:00,7
Now, all we have to do
is wait for Megan's husband to arrive.

565
00:27:01,024 --> 00:27:04,7
Then you can take center stage
and hopefully, he will take the bait.

566
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:07,1
Oh, there is Moira.

567
00:27:08,033 --> 00:27:10,1
I'm going to make sure she is okay.

568
00:27:16,005 --> 00:27:17,0
Hey.

569
00:27:20,001 --> 00:27:22,4
So everything is going
according to plan, huh?

570
00:27:23,026 --> 00:27:25,4
I guess we make a pretty good team, huh?

571
00:27:25,051 --> 00:27:26,6
Indeed.

572
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,4
So, when should I move my stuff back in?

573
00:27:33,056 --> 00:27:34,6
[laughs]

574
00:27:35,007 --> 00:27:35,9
What?

575
00:27:36,011 --> 00:27:38,4
Luce, I saw the way you looked at me
at the precinct.

576
00:27:39,044 --> 00:27:44,0
I understand that I wasn't giving you
what you needed before, but...

577
00:27:45,028 --> 00:27:46,7
I really think I can now.

578
00:27:50,096 --> 00:27:53,1

580
00:27:57,034 --> 00:27:59,0
Oh, my God. Lucifer...

581
00:27:59,042 --> 00:28:02,4
Your eyes, are you okay? What's happening?

582
00:28:02,051 --> 00:28:03,4
Nothing.

583
00:28:03,076 --> 00:28:06,2
Just an end-of-the-world prophecy
being fulfilled.

584
00:28:06,072 --> 00:28:09,0
But... maybe you can help me.

585
00:28:09,014 --> 00:28:10,1
Yeah.

586
00:28:10,052 --> 00:28:13,2
Of course. Of course, anything.

587
00:28:13,052 --> 00:28:14,4
Eve...

588
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,5

[sighs]

590
00:28:17,069 --> 00:28:20,0
-What do you mean?
-I treated you terribly,

591
00:28:20,011 --> 00:28:22,5
I hurt you, I used you.

592
00:28:22,078 --> 00:28:24,9
No, you didn't--

593
00:28:24,099 --> 00:28:27,0
I did! Deep down,
I knew it wasn't gonna work,

594
00:28:27,012 --> 00:28:29,8
but I strung you along anyway
for my own selfish wants,

595
00:28:29,095 --> 00:28:32,3
[voice wavers] so why don't you hate me?

596
00:28:33,071 --> 00:28:35,0
Because I love you.

597
00:28:40,026 --> 00:28:42,0
[whispers] Well, you shouldn't.

598

Heard you were looking for me. What's up?

[laughs]
What are you talking about?

637
00:31:52,057 --> 00:31:54,6
I went back and tracked down
who's police cruiser

638
00:31:54,074 --> 00:31:56,0
was outside Tiernan's office.

639
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,2
It was yours.

640
00:31:58,054 --> 00:32:00,9
Which explains you going through
that trash the other day

-in the conference room.
-You're right.

642

Turn me in.

I deserve it.

644
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,5
I won't do that.

645
00:32:10,051 --> 00:32:12,9
In fact, I scrubbed
your cruiser's location history.

646
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:14,5
Why would you do that?

647
00:32:15,097 --> 00:32:18,3
Why help me out?
It was unforgivable what I did!

648
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:21,0
You weren't the one who barged
into Lucifer's penthouse with a gun.

I might as well have been.

My daughter almost died
because of what I did.

651
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:28,7
So why help me out?
Why are you gonna let me off the hook?

652
00:32:28,098 --> 00:32:32,3
Why is everybody always letting me
get away with so much bullshit?

653
00:32:32,082 --> 00:32:33,6
I'm not.

654
00:32:34,016 --> 00:32:35,8
I just think that you are in pain.

More than any of us realize.

656

[club music playing]

658
00:32:56,018 --> 00:32:58,9
Lucifer, Moira just got a call
from Megan's husband.

659
00:32:59,006 --> 00:33:02,1
Please tell me it's a full confession
so we can skip to the arrest.

660
00:33:02,023 --> 00:33:05,3
No, he's not coming. He couldn't bear
to see the business sold.

661
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,9
So he is not the killer.

662
00:33:07,011 --> 00:33:10,0
Which means this whole charade
is a complete waste of time.

Thank you for helping me.

00:33:43,064 --> 00:33:47,4

-I'm not sure why you helped.
-Me either.

00:33:54,024 --> 00:33:57,9
[Eve] Well, you know,
I need to redefine things.

680
00:33:58,007 --> 00:34:00,0
Just like you suggested, Maze.

681
00:34:01,012 --> 00:34:04,0
[sighs] It seems like
Lucifer is clearly worried

682
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:05,0
about this prophecy.

683
00:34:05,016 --> 00:34:07,3
That must be what's holding him back.

684
00:34:07,042 --> 00:34:13,0
And the father here can help him realize
that is all just a bunch of nonsense.

685
00:34:13,013 --> 00:34:15,6

Why did you desire the files on the drive?

00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:51,8
that I am poison
for anyone who dares to care about me.

924
00:46:54,081 --> 00:46:56,0
And especially you.

925
00:47:03,027 --> 00:47:04,2
Lucifer...

926
00:47:05,028 --> 00:47:06,5
this isn't about me.

927
00:47:08,061 --> 00:47:09,6
I'm okay.

928
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:17,8
I haven't crumbled into a million pieces.

929
00:47:19,021 --> 00:47:20,6
I'm still here.

930
00:47:21,054 --> 00:47:22,7
And I'm fine.

931
00:47:22,084 --> 00:47:26,7
If I turn around, will you be fine
or will you look away in horror?

932
00:47:27,034 --> 00:47:29,8
-It doesn't matter.
-Of course it does, detective.

933
00:47:30,026 --> 00:47:31,5
No, it doesn't.

934
00:47:31,097 --> 00:47:33,6
Because this isn't about me.

935
00:47:34,005 --> 00:47:35,0
This is about you.

936
00:47:36,031 --> 00:47:38,0
Not gonna let you use me as an excuse

937
00:47:38,014 --> 00:47:40,7
to avoid dealing
with what is behind all of this.

938
00:47:41,044 --> 00:47:42,2
[sighs]

939
00:47:43,011 --> 00:47:47,4
You always talk about how much you hate
being blamed for humanity's sins.

940
00:47:48,024 --> 00:47:50,3
You know, "The Devil made me do it,"

941
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:53,3
and I think I know why you hate it
so much, because deep down,

942
00:47:53,041 --> 00:47:55,7
you blame yourself just as much...

943
00:47:56,041 --> 00:47:57,4
if not more!

944
00:47:58,033 --> 00:48:02,2
You have to stop taking responsibility
for things you can't control.

945
00:48:03,038 --> 00:48:04,4
[Chloe] Lucifer...

946
00:48:06,042 --> 00:48:08,3
you need to forgive yourself.

947
00:48:08,088 --> 00:48:10,3
I can't.

948
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,7
Why?

949
00:48:13,068 --> 00:48:15,1
I don't know how to.

950
00:48:16,097 --> 00:48:18,9
I don't even know where to begin.

951
00:48:22,035 --> 00:48:23,4
But...

952
00:48:24,002 --> 00:48:24,8
But what?

953
00:48:34,057 --> 00:48:35,7
I want to.

954
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:42,5
[sobs, gasps]

955
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:46,0
[Chloe gasps] Lucifer!

956
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:49,8
[whispers]
I think you just took the first step.

957
00:48:51,005 --> 00:48:52,5
[gasps, laughs]

958
00:48:53,047 --> 00:48:55,4
[laughs hysterically]

959
00:48:55,072 --> 00:48:58,5
-Look at that, detective.
-You're okay.

960
00:48:58,085 --> 00:49:00,0
We did it!

961
00:49:00,014 --> 00:49:02,1
[laughs, sighs]

962
00:49:03,081 --> 00:49:06,4
It looks like evil
won't be released after all.
