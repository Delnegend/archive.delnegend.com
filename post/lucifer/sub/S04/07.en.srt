1
00:00:15,043 --> 00:00:17,8
[faint groaning]

2
00:00:18,072 --> 00:00:20,9
[Eve] I never felt like that before.

3
00:00:21,035 --> 00:00:22,1
[groans]

4
00:00:22,077 --> 00:00:23,6
That was...

5
00:00:24,006 --> 00:00:25,2
[Lucifer] Exhilarating.

6
00:00:26,077 --> 00:00:29,1
[Eve] That man was so terrible.

7
00:00:29,065 --> 00:00:30,6
[Lucifer] Truly evil.

8
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:34,4
[Eve] We made him pay.

9
00:00:34,057 --> 00:00:35,4
Please.

10
00:00:36,028 --> 00:00:38,1
Who can we punish next?

11
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,0
[bang]

12
00:00:41,087 --> 00:00:43,5
I want to feel like that again.

13
00:00:44,012 --> 00:00:47,6
Yes, it's quite the rush,
finally being who I'm meant to be.

14
00:00:48,075 --> 00:00:53,1
But, sadly, my dear,
criminals don't line up to be punished.

15
00:00:56,034 --> 00:00:58,6
So that's why you work with the LAPD.

16
00:00:58,097 --> 00:01:00,8
It all makes so much sense now.

17
00:01:02,014 --> 00:01:05,3
You use them to find the bad guys.

18
00:01:07,073 --> 00:01:08,9
Well, I want in.

19
00:01:11,027 --> 00:01:12,2
Ah!

20
00:01:12,094 --> 00:01:14,6
-Do you now, darling?
-Mm-hmm.

21
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,5
Maybe we could do it together.

22
00:01:18,028 --> 00:01:22,1
Find the worst of the worst
and give them what they deserve.

23
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:27,0
[Eve sighs]

24
00:01:29,042 --> 00:01:32,3
[Chloe] So, Julian, you admit to...

25
00:01:32,063 --> 00:01:36,0
human trafficking
and to the murder of Gary Van Blunt

26
00:01:36,038 --> 00:01:38,0
and officer John Reyes.

27
00:01:38,018 --> 00:01:39,0
Yes.

28
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,2
You're going to jail
for a really long time, cop killer.

29
00:01:43,072 --> 00:01:46,0
-At least I'll be safe there.
-What?

30
00:01:47,002 --> 00:01:50,5
If you didn't break your back falling down
a hill, we need to know about that now.

31
00:01:50,065 --> 00:01:51,7
I fell down the hill.

32
00:01:51,082 --> 00:01:54,9
I f-- fell down the hill, I sw--
I swear!

33
00:01:56,003 --> 00:01:56,9
[whispering] Chloe.

34
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,4
[Julian sniffs]

35
00:02:00,016 --> 00:02:01,2
[Chloe whispering] What's up?

36
00:02:01,057 --> 00:02:02,6
Julian's reaction.

37
00:02:03,062 --> 00:02:04,9
Does it look familiar to you?

38
00:02:06,016 --> 00:02:07,8
-Huh?
-Like people we've seen before

39
00:02:07,096 --> 00:02:10,3
after a certain consultant
has been left alone with them.

40
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,6
What do you mean?

41
00:02:12,042 --> 00:02:14,2
-I think Lucifer did this.
-That's crazy.

42
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:16,5
You know what's crazy?
How much Lucifer gets away with.

43
00:02:16,067 --> 00:02:17,7
I'm sick of it. Aren't you?

44
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,0
Lucifer wouldn't do this.
He wouldn't go this far.

45
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:22,1
He would never take justice
into his own hands?

46
00:02:22,018 --> 00:02:24,4
Especially as a cop was killed
because of his stupid recklessness.

47
00:02:24,051 --> 00:02:25,9
You need to cut him some slack.

48
00:02:26,052 --> 00:02:29,7
You have had a target on his back
ever since...

49
00:02:31,044 --> 00:02:32,2
well...

50
00:02:33,077 --> 00:02:34,6
Charlotte.

51
00:02:36,053 --> 00:02:40,3
I'm just not sure if you're looking
at this objectively.

52
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,2
That's all.

53
00:02:42,032 --> 00:02:43,2
Like you are?

54
00:02:53,059 --> 00:02:56,4
[Remy] I could understand Lucifer
callously ignoring our duty

55
00:02:56,055 --> 00:02:58,6
to keep humans and the divine separate.

56
00:02:59,026 --> 00:03:00,2
But you?

57
00:03:00,034 --> 00:03:01,5
How could you do this?

58
00:03:01,076 --> 00:03:02,6
A child...

59
00:03:02,089 --> 00:03:03,7
with a human?

60
00:03:03,089 --> 00:03:05,2
Wonderful human.

61
00:03:06,089 --> 00:03:09,2
I know how difficult
this must be for you. All right?

62
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:11,1
I used to be just like you.

63
00:03:11,052 --> 00:03:15,0
Looking down on humans
as if they were ants.

64
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:18,2
But we need to realize
that we are not above them.

65
00:03:19,011 --> 00:03:20,2
I am above them.

66
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,2
But you...

67
00:03:22,057 --> 00:03:24,8
You don't even have your powers anymore,
do you?

68
00:03:24,091 --> 00:03:27,5
No, I can no longer slow time
and I'm glad.

69
00:03:27,087 --> 00:03:30,5
My powers, they kept me at a distance,

70
00:03:30,062 --> 00:03:33,0
kept me disconnected from humanity.

71
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:36,4
And I think that's why they're gone now.
Because I don't want that anymore.

72
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,0
You were the one who taught me

73
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,4
that celestials and humans
need to be separate.

74
00:03:40,055 --> 00:03:44,3
Yes,  Remy, I did,
and now I am telling you

75
00:03:44,076 --> 00:03:45,8
that I was wrong.

76
00:03:48,077 --> 00:03:49,8
Let me show you.

77
00:03:57,044 --> 00:03:59,6
[sound of car doors]

78
00:03:59,078 --> 00:04:02,1
[sound of a camera]

79
00:04:02,086 --> 00:04:04,4
Hey, Ella, who do we have?

80
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,2
Hey, Chloe.

81
00:04:06,082 --> 00:04:10,1
Victim died from a gunshot
straight to the head up on that bridge.

82
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,2
But apparently murdering wasn't enough.

83
00:04:12,037 --> 00:04:14,8
so they tossed his body over the bridge
like day-old garbage.

84
00:04:14,092 --> 00:04:17,9
Broke nearly every bone in his body
from the looks of it.

85
00:04:18,004 --> 00:04:18,9
[Chloe] Hmm.

86
00:04:20,034 --> 00:04:21,1
Are you okay?

87
00:04:22,013 --> 00:04:23,7
Just death. People die.

88
00:04:24,018 --> 00:04:25,0
Mm-hmm.

89
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:26,5
Well, we just deal with it.

90
00:04:28,043 --> 00:04:30,2
Anyhow, what do we know about this guy?

91
00:04:30,035 --> 00:04:31,4
[Ella] Sam Zofrelli.

92
00:04:31,052 --> 00:04:34,1
Rap sheet
filled with drug possession charges.

93
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:36,4
Oh! We also found traces of cocaine

94
00:04:36,048 --> 00:04:38,5
in his pockets, but no sign of drug use.

95
00:04:38,061 --> 00:04:40,2
So I'm thinking probably dealer.

96
00:04:40,032 --> 00:04:43,7
-So you think this was about drugs?
-Maybe. Pockets were empty.

97
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,9
Keys, wallet, all gone.

98
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,8
But the body was here for hours

99
00:04:47,091 --> 00:04:49,9
so could have been taken by anyone
brave enough

100
00:04:50,008 --> 00:04:51,6
to frisk a corpse this effed-up.

101
00:04:51,074 --> 00:04:53,5
But why throw a body over a bridge

102
00:04:53,058 --> 00:04:54,6
that's already dead?

103
00:04:54,075 --> 00:04:55,7
Where's Lucifer?

104
00:04:56,008 --> 00:04:59,0
Oh, he's been ignoring me actually.

105
00:05:01,021 --> 00:05:02,6
Oh, he's with Eve.

106
00:05:03,005 --> 00:05:05,7
Yes, probably with Eve.
What you think of her?

107
00:05:05,093 --> 00:05:09,8
I think that she's rubbing off on him
and not necessarily in a good way.

108
00:05:11,043 --> 00:05:12,6
Good morning, Detective.

109
00:05:13,093 --> 00:05:16,1
Please don't tell me she's behind me.

110
00:05:16,085 --> 00:05:18,0
She's behind you.

111
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,8
Hello.

112
00:05:21,094 --> 00:05:22,8
Lucifer.

113
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:25,1
This is a crime scene.
No visitors. No offense, Eve.

114
00:05:25,036 --> 00:05:26,9
Eve wants the same thing we do.

115
00:05:27,003 --> 00:05:28,2
-Catch a killer.
-Yes.

116
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,8
I am here to learn from you, Chloe.

117
00:05:30,095 --> 00:05:33,8
I want to know everything there is
to know about catching criminals.

118
00:05:34,025 --> 00:05:38,7
Especially the very, very bad ones.

119
00:05:39,058 --> 00:05:40,6
Can I talk to you, alone?

120
00:05:41,021 --> 00:05:42,6
[Eve giggles] Of course.

121
00:05:47,022 --> 00:05:48,3
This isn't gonna work.

122
00:05:48,043 --> 00:05:51,7
I agree. A gingham pocket square can
be a bit aggressive, but I'm feeling it.

123
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:54,3
-No. Eve being here, not OK.
-Why not?

124
00:05:55,018 --> 00:05:57,9
You can't just join a case
for the fun of it.

125
00:05:58,006 --> 00:06:00,1
We are solving a murder. This is serious.

126
00:06:00,023 --> 00:06:01,7
Oh, I agree. Very serious.

127
00:06:01,086 --> 00:06:04,4
If that's how you feel,
I completely understand.

128
00:06:05,023 --> 00:06:06,2
Where are you going?

129
00:06:06,086 --> 00:06:09,3
If you don't want us here,
we'll find the killer on our own.

130
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:11,1
You can't do that.

131
00:06:12,003 --> 00:06:13,2
Oh, yes we can.

132
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,4
Okay, fine.

133
00:06:17,025 --> 00:06:19,7
Fine. Eve can ride along
just for this case.

134
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:21,7
[Eve squeals] Exciting!

135
00:06:21,096 --> 00:06:22,9
[Lucifer laughs]

136
00:06:24,013 --> 00:06:26,5
This is going to be so much fun.

137
00:06:35,093 --> 00:06:38,4
[Eve]
Lucifer, this guy looks really guilty.

138
00:06:39,085 --> 00:06:40,9
What about this guy?

139
00:06:41,098 --> 00:06:43,6
That's one mean looking face.

140
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:48,8
-We should punish them.
-One criminal at a time, dear.

141
00:06:49,036 --> 00:06:51,3
[phone buzzes]

142
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:53,2
[Chloe] Decker.

143
00:06:55,016 --> 00:06:57,1
No, I will not accept his call.

144
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,4
Who was that?

145
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:02,8
Nobody.

146
00:07:06,055 --> 00:07:07,9
Ah-ah-ah!

147
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,3
[Dan] Lucifer's bringing his girlfriend
on cases now, huh?

148
00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:12,7
She's actually really sweet.

149
00:07:13,043 --> 00:07:14,7
Anyway, you know what?

150
00:07:14,085 --> 00:07:17,3
Why not do whatever makes you happy?

151
00:07:17,072 --> 00:07:20,3
Because any second, bam! You can get hit

152
00:07:20,044 --> 00:07:22,4
by a chunk of blue ice from an airplane

153
00:07:22,048 --> 00:07:26,0
or get blown up into a million pieces
by some crazed killer.

154
00:07:26,015 --> 00:07:28,7
Or you could mysteriously
break your spinal cord

155
00:07:28,082 --> 00:07:31,2
and become, you know, paralyzed.

156
00:07:32,003 --> 00:07:32,8
Yeah.

157
00:07:33,003 --> 00:07:36,2
Is anybody investigating what happened
to Julian McCaffrey?

158
00:07:36,058 --> 00:07:38,8
Nobody's buying his
"I fell down the hill" story, right?

159
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:41,3
He didn't file any charges,
so there's nothing to investigate.

160
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,8
Even if we wanted to,

161
00:07:43,017 --> 00:07:46,7
remember that house he lived in?
It's probably been professionally cleaned.

162
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:48,5
You're right.

163
00:07:49,076 --> 00:07:51,0
You're absolutely right.

164
00:07:53,084 --> 00:07:56,2
Oh, that's Daniel.

165
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,3
He's a douche again.

166
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:59,3
[Eve] Oh, shall we punish him too?

167
00:07:59,068 --> 00:08:01,8
Believe me, his existence
is punishment enough.

168
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,0
[Eve giggles]

169
00:08:05,048 --> 00:08:06,9
Hey, Ella. What do we have?

170
00:08:07,073 --> 00:08:11,7
Well, we still don't know why Sam's body
was tossed off the bridge.

171
00:08:11,094 --> 00:08:14,8
Because the killer is a maniacal monster
who needs to be taken down.

172
00:08:15,066 --> 00:08:16,9
[Ella] Er... maybe.

173
00:08:17,049 --> 00:08:21,7
But I did discover that the killer
pistol-whipped poor Sam before he died.

174
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:23,9
-Sounds like it could be personal.
-And aggressive.

175
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,4
And cruel.

176
00:08:25,075 --> 00:08:29,5
And a mistake,
because I was able to recover something

177
00:08:29,067 --> 00:08:31,3
from the gun marks on his face.

178
00:08:31,051 --> 00:08:33,5
Gold flakes.

179
00:08:33,067 --> 00:08:35,0
-Gold flakes?
-Mm-hmm.

180
00:08:35,026 --> 00:08:38,2
[gasps] In there? That's amazing.

181
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:41,0
Ah! Well, you know, I'm just doing my job.

182
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,7
Do you get to be there
for the punishment too?

183
00:08:44,027 --> 00:08:46,1
Er, no.

184
00:08:46,048 --> 00:08:47,6
Golden gun.

185
00:08:48,056 --> 00:08:51,3
It's unique and it sounds familiar.

186
00:08:51,044 --> 00:08:53,1
Yes, Roger Moore's Bond films.

187
00:08:53,024 --> 00:08:55,9
Perhaps our killer's Scaramanga,
the man with three nipples.

188
00:08:56,074 --> 00:08:57,5
Maybe.

189
00:08:57,066 --> 00:08:59,7
Ella, do you remember
there was a hitman...

190
00:09:00,016 --> 00:09:02,7
or something who carries a golden pistol.
Do you remember that?

191
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,2
[Ella] Ah, let me see.

192
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:06,3
Er... ooh, right here.

193
00:09:06,058 --> 00:09:09,2
Greg Grabowski...

194
00:09:09,038 --> 00:09:11,9
and goes by the nickname "Pony Boy".

195
00:09:12,026 --> 00:09:14,5
Pony Boy? Stay gold indeed.

196
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:17,0
And you're never able to pin him down
because he's so good.

197
00:09:17,013 --> 00:09:18,9
But if this wasn't a hit
and it was personal,

198
00:09:19,001 --> 00:09:20,9
it would explain why he was so sloppy.

199
00:09:21,006 --> 00:09:21,9
He sounds terrible.

200
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:25,2
-Let's go punish him!
-You mean, bring him to justice.

201
00:09:26,014 --> 00:09:27,2
That's what I said.

202
00:09:27,098 --> 00:09:30,1
[Lucifer] Oh!
That clears that up. Come on.

203
00:09:33,048 --> 00:09:35,7
When I was a newborn demon...

204
00:09:37,015 --> 00:09:39,1
I was smaller than my opponents.

205
00:09:40,003 --> 00:09:41,5
But I was fast.

206
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:45,2
So I used my speed, kept low...

207
00:09:46,075 --> 00:09:49,1
and always went for the major arteries.

208
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:52,3
With my first vanquished foe on his knees,

209
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,5
I slit my blade across his throat.

210
00:09:54,084 --> 00:09:58,5
I felt the heat from his blood
dripping down my face.

211
00:10:01,051 --> 00:10:05,3
And then a stranger heat in my loins.

212
00:10:05,047 --> 00:10:07,2
Okay.

213
00:10:08,002 --> 00:10:12,2
When I mentioned that the baby could
hear everything from inside the womb

214
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,6
I imagined introducing him to things like

215
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:15,8
classical music...

216
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:18,0
and stories...

217
00:10:19,091 --> 00:10:23,2
that aren't about graphic murders.

218
00:10:23,037 --> 00:10:26,6
Why would you want to hear a story
not about graphic murder?

219
00:10:28,054 --> 00:10:30,0
We can talk about that later.

220
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:32,1
-I have to go to work.
-Great.

221
00:10:32,034 --> 00:10:33,8
Give me a second to get my knives.

222
00:10:37,051 --> 00:10:38,9
Maze, sweetie.

223
00:10:40,026 --> 00:10:41,9
You can't come to work with me.

224
00:10:42,035 --> 00:10:43,3
[Maze] I have to!

225
00:10:45,018 --> 00:10:48,2
Do you know all the things that could
happen to you or your baby out there?

226
00:10:48,031 --> 00:10:49,9
Er... heartburn?

227
00:10:50,006 --> 00:10:50,9
[ring of metal]

228
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,6
You could get gunned down
in a drive-by shooting, Linda.

229
00:10:54,007 --> 00:10:57,5
Or kidnapped by a cartel who use
women as drug mules,

230
00:10:57,069 --> 00:11:00,2
not to mention what an angel baby
will fetch on the black market.

231
00:11:01,003 --> 00:11:01,8
How comforting.

232
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:04,4
You said I'm part of this family, Linda.

233
00:11:04,049 --> 00:11:05,9
So I'm going to protect you.

234
00:11:06,008 --> 00:11:08,4
Maze, the people
I am seeing this afternoon

235
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:11,2
are a vegan chef
who compulsively shoplifts...

236
00:11:11,092 --> 00:11:13,9
and a record producer who wets the bed.

237
00:11:14,042 --> 00:11:15,3
-But I--
-Maze...

238
00:11:15,088 --> 00:11:17,2
I don't need protecting.

239
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:24,1
["We Love It" by Outasight playing]

240
00:11:24,026 --> 00:11:25,8
[rattle of cans]

241
00:11:36,073 --> 00:11:37,8
What you doing?

242
00:11:38,011 --> 00:11:39,4
Oh, hey. Er...

243
00:11:40,053 --> 00:11:43,1
I paid off the cleaning crew
in Julian's house.

244
00:11:44,012 --> 00:11:46,7
What? I'm looking for something
in his trash to prove

245
00:11:46,087 --> 00:11:48,9
that somebody was there
the night he was paralyzed.

246
00:11:50,008 --> 00:11:54,1
Well, I don't know about any of that,
but I can help if you want.

247
00:11:55,084 --> 00:11:56,7
Lucifer's brand.

248
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,4
What did you say?

249
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,1
Er, nothing.

250
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:01,9
I, uh,

251
00:12:02,093 --> 00:12:03,8
found what I needed.

252
00:12:04,093 --> 00:12:08,2
Oh, er...
Don't worry about me, Dan. I can clean up.

253
00:12:14,006 --> 00:12:16,1
Damn, these guys are huge.

254
00:12:16,052 --> 00:12:18,1
We can take them, right, honey?

255
00:12:18,023 --> 00:12:20,0
Of course I can, darling, I'm the Devil.

256
00:12:20,023 --> 00:12:24,3
In that case, I hope this guy we're after
is the biggest, meanest one there is.

257
00:12:24,045 --> 00:12:25,5
We don't want that.

258
00:12:25,066 --> 00:12:26,4
I do.

259
00:12:26,057 --> 00:12:29,3
Makes it more satisfying when
Lucifer beats them up.

260
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,4
We don't beat people up
in the middle of the street.

261
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:34,2
[Eve] Oh. Do we take them back
to Lucifer's penthouse?

262
00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:36,7
[Chloe] Anyway.
We don't beat people up anywhere.

263
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,3
Unless they resist
and then it's Devil by TKO.

264
00:12:39,038 --> 00:12:41,6
-[Eve sighs]
-Don't worry, they always resist.

265
00:12:42,026 --> 00:12:43,3
There's Pony Boy.

266
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,2
Look at those arms.

267
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,8
Let's not get carried away.

268
00:12:52,035 --> 00:12:56,2
Greg "Pony Boy" Grabowski, LAPD.
You're under arrest

269
00:12:56,035 --> 00:12:57,5
-for the murder--
-Okay.

270
00:12:57,081 --> 00:12:59,1
-What?
-What?

271
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:01,5
What was that?
I thought they always resisted.

272
00:13:01,065 --> 00:13:03,8
Look.
I've been through this a hundred times.

273
00:13:04,082 --> 00:13:06,1
I'm just gonna wait for my lawyer.

274
00:13:06,032 --> 00:13:10,0
Lucifer, you should torture the truth
out of him until his lawyer shows up.

275
00:13:10,066 --> 00:13:12,4
Eve, that's not how this works.

276
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:16,2
Everybody calm down. Eve just wants to see
the devil do his thing.

277
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:18,3
And there is one thing
you haven't seen me do.

278
00:13:19,004 --> 00:13:19,9
Tell me...

279
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:22,1
My little Pony Boy,

280
00:13:22,076 --> 00:13:23,6
what is it you desire?

281
00:13:24,047 --> 00:13:25,4
I...

282
00:13:26,034 --> 00:13:28,1
I wish...

283
00:13:30,005 --> 00:13:31,0
I wish...

284
00:13:31,051 --> 00:13:33,7
wish my boss had let me kill Sam.

285
00:13:34,043 --> 00:13:36,3
-Oh.
-[Chloe] Hmm.

286
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:38,9
[Lucifer] Sorry, darling,
we can't punish him after all.

287
00:13:39,002 --> 00:13:39,9
The man's innocent.

288
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,3
Are you crazy?

289
00:13:41,098 --> 00:13:44,3
Watching the devil do this thing is so...

290
00:13:44,099 --> 00:13:45,8
hot.

291
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:49,2
So you wished your boss let you kill him.

292
00:13:49,049 --> 00:13:52,8
Then who's your boss and if it wasn't you,
who used your golden gun to do it?

293
00:13:52,091 --> 00:13:54,2
Lawyer. Now.

294
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,3
I mean...

295
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:03,8
Turn around.

296
00:14:06,034 --> 00:14:07,3
[Eve squeals]

297
00:14:07,038 --> 00:14:08,5
[Lucifer] It's fun, isn't it?

298
00:14:09,072 --> 00:14:10,5
[Ella] Hey, Chloe.

299
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,2
I know that look.

300
00:14:14,077 --> 00:14:15,9
You found something.

301
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:17,3
I hope so.

302
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:20,1
Hitmen are often paid
as corporate employees

303
00:14:20,023 --> 00:14:21,9
through shell companies to hide the money.

304
00:14:22,002 --> 00:14:25,1
But it also sometimes means
that they get the corporate perks.

305
00:14:25,053 --> 00:14:28,0
Like covering their
gym membership fees.

306
00:14:28,036 --> 00:14:30,8
So who's paying for Pony Boy
to get so jacked?

307
00:14:30,095 --> 00:14:33,7
It looks like it all tracks back
to Jacob Tiernan here.

308
00:14:33,078 --> 00:14:35,1
That paralyzed dude's dad?

309
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,7
Does this have something
to do with that case?

310
00:14:37,087 --> 00:14:40,3
Tiernan's son shows up
paralyzed from the chest down.

311
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,8
Then this guy dies.
So it has to be, right?

312
00:14:42,092 --> 00:14:45,8
I think Sam's bones were broken before
he was killed

313
00:14:45,088 --> 00:14:47,9
in the exact same spot that Julian's was.

314
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,5
Julian McCaffrey?

315
00:14:49,068 --> 00:14:51,8
-[Chloe] Yeah.
-What does this have to do with him?

316
00:14:51,097 --> 00:14:54,4
Maybe Tiernan thought
that Sam broke Julian's back.

317
00:14:54,051 --> 00:14:56,5
Normally he'd hire Pony Boy
to do his dirty work,

318
00:14:56,064 --> 00:14:59,2
-but it's his son so--
-He wanted to enact revenge himself

319
00:14:59,035 --> 00:15:01,2
and borrowed Pony Boy's gun to do it.

320
00:15:01,031 --> 00:15:02,9
-Yes.
-I'll get you the ME report.

321
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,1
Great.

322
00:15:08,003 --> 00:15:09,5
Hey. Luce.

323
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,7
I did that.

324
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:14,4
I broke Julian's back.
Tiernan killed an innocent man.

325
00:15:15,053 --> 00:15:16,6
What does that mean?

326
00:15:17,087 --> 00:15:20,9
It means, my dear, that now more than ever

327
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:23,4
that monster needs to be punished.

328
00:15:26,055 --> 00:15:28,4
[Chloe] Mr. Tiernan,
I don't know if you heard

329
00:15:28,051 --> 00:15:30,4
but a drug dealer was killed this morning.

330
00:15:30,076 --> 00:15:32,4
What does that have to do with me?

331
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:35,9
[Chloe] Well, that's the interesting part.

332
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:39,6
He had the exact same spinal injury
as your son.

333
00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:43,4
So it would seem that
possibly someone is out for revenge.

334
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:46,2
My son worked with a lot of bad people.

335
00:15:46,036 --> 00:15:49,1
In fact, Julian wasn't exactly
a good person himself,

336
00:15:49,028 --> 00:15:52,6
which is why I had to excise him
from my business.

337
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:56,6
You... you love your children,
but at a certain point

338
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:59,0
-you have to let them--
-Stand on their own two legs.

339
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:03,4
[Chloe] Mr Tiernan, do you know a man
named Greg Grabowski?

340
00:16:04,067 --> 00:16:07,0
Goes by the colorful moniker "Pony Boy".

341
00:16:07,063 --> 00:16:08,4
No.

342
00:16:09,063 --> 00:16:10,8
[Chloe] Hmm. That's odd,

343
00:16:10,097 --> 00:16:13,3
because one of your companies
pays his bills.

344
00:16:13,076 --> 00:16:16,3
I have a lot of companies
paying a lot of people a lot of money.

345
00:16:16,047 --> 00:16:17,8
I don't keep track of every penny.

346
00:16:18,035 --> 00:16:20,6
You kept track of your son, though,
didn't you?

347
00:16:20,085 --> 00:16:23,5
Which is why you consistently bailed him
out of jail.

348
00:16:23,064 --> 00:16:25,7
Always getting him out of trouble.

349
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,7
He never learned, did he?

350
00:16:27,098 --> 00:16:32,9
In fact, some might say it's your fault
he became a killer, a human trafficker.

351
00:16:33,082 --> 00:16:35,0
A broken little doll.

352
00:16:36,053 --> 00:16:37,3
[bang]

353
00:16:38,087 --> 00:16:40,7
My son had a lot of friends.

354
00:16:41,012 --> 00:16:45,6
Maybe one of them decided to make
the piece of garbage who crippled him pay.

355
00:16:45,096 --> 00:16:46,8
Really?

356
00:16:47,075 --> 00:16:49,8
Because I had a little chat with Julian

357
00:16:49,088 --> 00:16:52,3
right before he shot a police officer
in cold blood.

358
00:16:52,038 --> 00:16:55,6
He said that you were an even worse person
than he was.

359
00:16:56,018 --> 00:16:59,6
Mm. That must make you a true monster.

360
00:16:59,076 --> 00:17:02,5
Unless you have actual cause
to charge me with something,

361
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,7
this little chat is over.

362
00:17:04,006 --> 00:17:06,0
Oh, I'm the devil, Tiernan,

363
00:17:06,073 --> 00:17:08,3
I have all the cause I need.

364
00:17:10,007 --> 00:17:11,6
Detective, I think it's time you left

365
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:14,9
so I can do what I do best
and punish this man.

366
00:17:15,003 --> 00:17:15,9
Get out.

367
00:17:16,061 --> 00:17:19,2
Lucifer. He will be punished.

368
00:17:19,053 --> 00:17:22,0
[creaking]

369
00:17:22,012 --> 00:17:24,7
Lucifer. Lucifer, stop.

370
00:17:25,033 --> 00:17:27,5
Lucifer, do it.

371
00:17:27,062 --> 00:17:28,6
Get out!

372
00:17:28,096 --> 00:17:30,0
Detective...

373
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:31,6
leave.

374
00:17:32,076 --> 00:17:33,6
Stop.

375
00:17:37,063 --> 00:17:38,5
[coughs]

376
00:17:40,005 --> 00:17:40,9
This isn't over.

377
00:17:55,019 --> 00:17:57,2
[Chloe] Tiernan killed Sam,
but we have no proof.

378
00:17:57,032 --> 00:17:58,1
So?

379
00:17:58,024 --> 00:18:00,3
So Tiernan's gonna double
his legal defense

380
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:02,6
now that you've hulked out in his office.

381
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:04,2
Devil is as devil does.

382
00:18:05,008 --> 00:18:08,3
What about this other guy? Uh, Pony Boy.

383
00:18:08,042 --> 00:18:10,0
Pony Boy already posted bail.

384
00:18:10,017 --> 00:18:11,6
Or Tiernan posted it for him.

385
00:18:11,088 --> 00:18:15,3
You're saying that we don't get to punish
anybody?

386
00:18:16,084 --> 00:18:18,6
Honey... you promised.

387
00:18:18,072 --> 00:18:20,0
Can we-- give us a moment. Thanks.

388
00:18:22,005 --> 00:18:23,5
[Chloe] What the hell is up with you?

389
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,3
I finally figured out who I am,
that's all.

390
00:18:25,081 --> 00:18:28,3
Lucifer, this is not who you are.

391
00:18:29,014 --> 00:18:31,0
I think Eve is a bad influence on you.

392
00:18:32,002 --> 00:18:33,9
This has nothing to do with her.

393
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:36,6
It's who I am, I punish people.

394
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:41,2
So do I, but like I said, there is
a right way and there is a wrong way.

395
00:18:41,028 --> 00:18:43,4
What makes you the authority
on right and wrong?

396
00:18:43,053 --> 00:18:45,8
I'm a cop and it's the law.

397
00:18:45,095 --> 00:18:47,5
Well, I'm the devil. [claps]

398
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,5
I ruled Hell. Bad people were sent to me
so they could get what they deserved.

399
00:18:53,075 --> 00:18:57,6
It is my job to do the same here on Earth
because when I don't...

400
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:04,3
When I don't, bad things happen.

401
00:19:07,085 --> 00:19:10,5
That is why I broke Julian's back.

402
00:19:15,011 --> 00:19:18,1
And that is why I won't let Tiernan
get away with it.

403
00:19:19,061 --> 00:19:20,8
You broke Julian's back.

404
00:19:23,087 --> 00:19:25,8
What am I supposed to do with that,
Lucifer?

405
00:19:25,095 --> 00:19:28,1
It's not your place to do anything
about it.

406
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,0
Then why?

407
00:19:31,075 --> 00:19:34,7
Why ask me to leave
when we were in Tiernan's office?

408
00:19:34,088 --> 00:19:37,3
You were going to hurt him
and you wanted me to leave

409
00:19:37,046 --> 00:19:39,0
because you knew it was wrong.

410
00:19:39,026 --> 00:19:41,9
No. Because you've made it plainly clear

411
00:19:42,001 --> 00:19:44,1
that you can't handle who I am.

412
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,2
[blows]

413
00:20:00,057 --> 00:20:02,4
[woman] Mr Tiernan, the cops are back.

414
00:20:02,091 --> 00:20:05,8
-I have nothing more to say.
-[Dan] I'm here about your son.

415
00:20:10,062 --> 00:20:11,6
Thank you, Margaret.

416
00:20:16,017 --> 00:20:17,9
He didn't just fall down that hill.

417
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,7
Someone deliberately broke his back.

418
00:20:22,051 --> 00:20:23,6
And I know who it was.

419
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,6
Why haven't you arrested this man?

420
00:20:26,076 --> 00:20:28,6
I don't have enough proof
to put him in jail...

421
00:20:29,022 --> 00:20:31,0
but he needs to be accountable
for his actions,

422
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,5
and I know you're a powerful man...

423
00:20:34,002 --> 00:20:35,1
a man who ruins his enemies.

424
00:20:36,073 --> 00:20:37,7
I'm listening.

425
00:20:38,057 --> 00:20:39,5
Look.

426
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:46,2
You could finally give him a taste
of the punishment he deserves.

427
00:20:47,028 --> 00:20:48,6
What is this man's name?

428
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,0
Lucifer Morningstar.

429
00:20:58,004 --> 00:21:00,0
[Ella]
Since we know the murder was personal,

430
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,8
I looked back over the autopsy report

431
00:21:01,092 --> 00:21:05,3
and I was hoping we could find spit
or urine or something

432
00:21:05,047 --> 00:21:06,7
we could use to track DNA.

433
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:08,7
It's amazing how many dudes do that.

434
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,2
I really don't get why.

435
00:21:10,051 --> 00:21:11,6
Do you get why?

436
00:21:12,018 --> 00:21:13,7
Anyway, no luck there,

437
00:21:13,085 --> 00:21:17,2
but I did notice
that one of his fingers was broken.

438
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:19,7
Still post-mortem, but not from the fall.

439
00:21:19,086 --> 00:21:22,5
It looks like someone broke his finger
to pry a ring off.

440
00:21:22,061 --> 00:21:24,8
Probably whoever
stole all his money and drugs.

441
00:21:25,007 --> 00:21:27,2
Mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah.

442
00:21:27,028 --> 00:21:28,8
Er, you okay?

443
00:21:30,066 --> 00:21:33,5
Do you think there is such a thing
as celestial justice?

444
00:21:34,054 --> 00:21:37,8
Because if celestial justice does exist,

445
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:39,5
like heaven and hell,

446
00:21:39,067 --> 00:21:43,3
then what we've been doing here,
say arresting criminals...

447
00:21:44,017 --> 00:21:45,2
why even bother?

448
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:50,8
I know you're religious and I thought
you may have some thoughts on it.

449
00:21:51,072 --> 00:21:55,4
Well, I was religious

450
00:21:55,085 --> 00:21:57,1
-and...
-Oh.

451
00:21:57,023 --> 00:22:00,9
...when I used to believe
in all that stuff,

452
00:22:01,006 --> 00:22:04,4
I really thought that I was doing my part

453
00:22:04,053 --> 00:22:06,6
to uphold right and wrong on Earth

454
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:09,4
and everyone would get
their comeuppance eventually,

455
00:22:09,057 --> 00:22:11,4
but we still needed to keep people safe.

456
00:22:12,028 --> 00:22:15,8
But now I believe we are all anybody's got

457
00:22:15,091 --> 00:22:18,4
and if we don't hold people accountable,
nobody will

458
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:21,2
because heaven and hell, they don't exist.

459
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:23,1
But what if they do exist?

460
00:22:23,021 --> 00:22:25,0
-Say, the devil.
-He's not real.

461
00:22:25,042 --> 00:22:26,6
Chloe, look at the Bible.

462
00:22:26,076 --> 00:22:28,4
It is so full of contradictions.

463
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:30,1
Fine. Take the devil, for example.

464
00:22:30,068 --> 00:22:33,0
The devil's supposed to be pure evil,
right?

465
00:22:33,068 --> 00:22:35,5
But he started out as an angel.

466
00:22:35,081 --> 00:22:39,9
You can't start good
and the turn all evil.

467
00:22:40,002 --> 00:22:41,8
I mean,
that's what they want us to believe?

468
00:22:41,094 --> 00:22:42,8
You're right.

469
00:22:44,019 --> 00:22:45,0
He's an angel.

470
00:22:46,011 --> 00:22:48,4
No, my point is that it's all bullshit.

471
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,8
I...

472
00:22:57,062 --> 00:23:00,4
[Amenadiel] This is where I came
with the mother of my child

473
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:02,9
right after we found out
that we were going to be parents.

474
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,4
We both realized...

475
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,4
just how wonderful it would be.

476
00:23:07,067 --> 00:23:09,1
[Remy] All I see is weakness.

477
00:23:09,047 --> 00:23:10,3
They're pathetic.

478
00:23:10,043 --> 00:23:13,9
If you raise your son surrounded by them,
he will become like they are.

479
00:23:14,005 --> 00:23:16,9
They may be flawed, yes, but so are we

480
00:23:17,056 --> 00:23:19,9
and flawed doesn't mean weak.

481
00:23:20,006 --> 00:23:21,9
Sounds like something
a weak person would say.

482
00:23:23,052 --> 00:23:25,9
Amenadiel, I just want
the best for your child.

483
00:23:26,002 --> 00:23:26,8
So do I.

484
00:23:31,091 --> 00:23:32,9
I'm taking the baby.

485
00:23:33,007 --> 00:23:34,9
No, Remy, you're not.

486
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,9
I'll never let you find him or his mother.

487
00:23:37,099 --> 00:23:38,8
Too late.

488
00:23:39,029 --> 00:23:40,7
I picked up the scent this morning.

489
00:23:41,008 --> 00:23:43,3
I've listened to you out of respect,
Amenadiel,

490
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,6
for what you once were.

491
00:23:45,013 --> 00:23:47,2
But I'm convinced more than ever
of what I need to do.

492
00:23:47,042 --> 00:23:48,3
Remy.

493
00:23:49,063 --> 00:23:51,8
I won't let you take my child.

494
00:23:52,018 --> 00:23:53,3
Try and stop me.

495
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:55,9
[flap of wings]

496
00:23:56,014 --> 00:23:57,8
[flap of wings]

497
00:24:05,081 --> 00:24:08,0
[faint tinkling sound]

498
00:24:17,012 --> 00:24:19,2
[low roll of thunder]

499
00:24:30,013 --> 00:24:32,3
[low roll of thunder]

500
00:24:38,085 --> 00:24:40,4
[Linda gasps]

501
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,3
Oh, my. Maze!

502
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,4
What is it?

503
00:24:44,073 --> 00:24:46,4
I thought someone was following me.

504
00:24:46,056 --> 00:24:49,7
-Who?
-You. You are following me.

505
00:24:49,082 --> 00:24:50,8
Why are you following me?

506
00:24:50,094 --> 00:24:52,6
I'm protecting you
when you leave the house.

507
00:24:52,078 --> 00:24:54,5
Don't you have anything else to do?

508
00:24:54,086 --> 00:24:56,4
Like hunting bounty.

509
00:24:56,057 --> 00:24:57,9
I cleared my entire schedule.

510
00:24:57,099 --> 00:24:59,5
I am never leaving your side.

511
00:24:59,066 --> 00:25:01,7
I don't need you to always be around.

512
00:25:02,004 --> 00:25:04,1
I need you to back off.

513
00:25:04,029 --> 00:25:05,1
But...

514
00:25:06,033 --> 00:25:08,7
how else am I supposed to protect
our baby?

515
00:25:09,084 --> 00:25:10,7
Our?

516
00:25:12,088 --> 00:25:13,9
Maze, this isn't...

517
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:17,2
I just need some space. Okay?

518
00:25:18,055 --> 00:25:21,5
Sure. Since we're here,
do you want to grab a coconut water?

519
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:30,2
[crash]

520
00:25:30,036 --> 00:25:35,2
[roar of rubble falling]

521
00:25:35,065 --> 00:25:38,7
I will never let you anywhere near Linda
or my son!

522
00:25:38,082 --> 00:25:41,0
Who's gonna stop me? You?

523
00:25:41,045 --> 00:25:43,2
There's only one way to find out.

524
00:25:43,087 --> 00:25:45,4
[whipping of air]

525
00:25:47,037 --> 00:25:48,2
[smash]

526
00:25:51,046 --> 00:25:53,3
Can't have anyone saying
it wasn't a fair fight.

527
00:25:54,026 --> 00:25:57,5
[whipping of air, clash of metal]

528
00:25:58,097 --> 00:26:00,7
I'm not going to let you raise this baby
here,

529
00:26:00,093 --> 00:26:03,0
where everything special about him
will be leached away.

530
00:26:08,023 --> 00:26:11,2
He will be special
because he's raised here!

531
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,7
-[Amenadiel roars]
-[boom]

532
00:26:14,011 --> 00:26:15,0
With his family.

533
00:26:15,011 --> 00:26:17,5
Funny, I thought I was your family.

534
00:26:20,074 --> 00:26:22,3
You are my family, Remy.

535
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:23,4
But this is my son!

536
00:26:23,054 --> 00:26:24,9
[Amenadiel groans]

537
00:26:25,062 --> 00:26:27,6
-[crash]
-[metal clinks]

538
00:26:30,013 --> 00:26:32,0
[both groaning]

539
00:26:36,088 --> 00:26:38,4
[Remy yells]

540
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:40,5
[Remy groans]

541
00:26:40,064 --> 00:26:41,5
[Remy gasps]

542
00:26:43,005 --> 00:26:45,1
Earth hasn't made me weak, Remy.

543
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:49,8
It's made me stronger.

544
00:26:52,065 --> 00:26:53,4
[clink]

545
00:26:57,094 --> 00:26:59,9
A true warrior admits their defeat.

546
00:27:01,041 --> 00:27:02,9
So you'll respect my wishes?

547
00:27:04,024 --> 00:27:06,3
I will... reluctantly.

548
00:27:07,075 --> 00:27:08,9
But be careful, brother.

549
00:27:09,025 --> 00:27:10,7
I still fear one day...

550
00:27:11,042 --> 00:27:13,2
you'll come to regret your decision.

551
00:27:16,025 --> 00:27:19,5
[wings flutter]

552
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:22,5
Hey, Linda.

553
00:27:22,093 --> 00:27:26,5
So I'm just calling because
I'm a little worried...

554
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,6
about Lucifer,
and thought that you might know

555
00:27:29,077 --> 00:27:33,2
what's going on with him. When you get
a chance, call me back. Thanks.

556
00:27:34,073 --> 00:27:36,1
What's wrong with Lucifer?

557
00:27:40,049 --> 00:27:42,1
Is he okay?

558
00:27:42,032 --> 00:27:43,7
Yeah, Lucifer's okay.

559
00:27:44,049 --> 00:27:46,0
I think he's just...

560
00:27:46,045 --> 00:27:48,5
He's just going through something
right now.

561
00:27:48,062 --> 00:27:51,2
Don't you always say that
when somebody's going through something,

562
00:27:51,062 --> 00:27:53,5
that's when they need their friends
the most?

563
00:27:55,067 --> 00:27:57,6
You know what? You're right, monkey.

564
00:27:58,084 --> 00:27:59,7
But...

565
00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:04,9
I'm just not sure that I'm the friend
that Lucifer needs right now.

566
00:28:10,035 --> 00:28:11,5
You do your homework.

567
00:28:16,006 --> 00:28:18,7
[Lucifer] Could tie Tiernan
to the anchor of one of his ships.

568
00:28:18,086 --> 00:28:21,7
-[Eve] Mm-hmm.
-Or a million paper cuts

569
00:28:21,078 --> 00:28:23,4
from his own hundred-dollar bills.

570
00:28:23,078 --> 00:28:24,6
Great.

571
00:28:24,074 --> 00:28:25,9
Oh, no, actually...

572
00:28:26,045 --> 00:28:29,9
I know a man who owns an emu farm.
They're surprisingly bloodthirsty animals.

573
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:33,0
Just pick a punishment and let's go.
What's the hold-up?

574
00:28:33,008 --> 00:28:35,2
[Lucifer] All in good time, my darling.

575
00:28:36,025 --> 00:28:39,5
You know how satisfying
delayed gratification is in bed, right?

576
00:28:41,076 --> 00:28:42,8
I think you're stalling.

577
00:28:43,009 --> 00:28:44,0
[laughs]

578
00:28:44,051 --> 00:28:45,4
What?

579
00:28:45,076 --> 00:28:46,8
Because of Chloe.

580
00:28:48,051 --> 00:28:49,5
[sighing] Look...

581
00:28:51,043 --> 00:28:52,4
I like Chloe.

582
00:28:53,018 --> 00:28:54,6
I do, she's great.

583
00:28:54,094 --> 00:28:56,5
But to be honest...

584
00:28:58,061 --> 00:29:00,6
I think she's a bad influence on you.

585
00:29:00,086 --> 00:29:02,4
Oh. [scoffs]

586
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:05,3
This has nothing to do
with the detective.

587
00:29:05,045 --> 00:29:07,4
It's just better
when you punish them properly.

588
00:29:07,057 --> 00:29:08,4
Lucifer...

589
00:29:10,091 --> 00:29:14,1
I just want you to be
the best version of yourself.

590
00:29:14,029 --> 00:29:15,2
You know?

591
00:29:15,037 --> 00:29:18,2
That devil I met in the garden.

592
00:29:19,004 --> 00:29:19,9
[sighs]

593
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,4
I held myself back for so long
 and I can see you doing the same...

594
00:29:25,001 --> 00:29:26,0
because of her.

595
00:29:27,026 --> 00:29:31,1
I just think she might be a little
too involved in your life.

596
00:29:31,089 --> 00:29:33,9
-That is preposterous.
-[bell rings]

597
00:29:35,056 --> 00:29:36,4
Hi, Lucifer.

598
00:29:36,085 --> 00:29:37,6
Who's this?

599
00:29:37,085 --> 00:29:40,4
That is the detective's offspring.

600
00:29:41,011 --> 00:29:42,6
You have a piano up here?

601
00:29:43,036 --> 00:29:45,2
-Yes, but no! Please!
-[piano keys crash]

602
00:29:45,028 --> 00:29:47,4
Please don't touch that.
I don't know where you've been.

603
00:29:47,082 --> 00:29:49,2
[Trixie] Look at all those books!

604
00:29:49,032 --> 00:29:50,9
Yes, emphasis on the look--

605
00:29:52,008 --> 00:29:53,1
Whoa, a pony.

606
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:55,5
Be careful with that,
that was a gift from Napoleon.

607
00:29:56,033 --> 00:29:58,5
-Do you have a pet?
-Yeah-- No, not really.

608
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:01,5
You have stairs to get to your bedroom.
[gasps]

609
00:30:03,076 --> 00:30:04,6
Like a princess.

610
00:30:04,076 --> 00:30:06,2
Like a what?

611
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,6
[Eve giggles]

612
00:30:07,072 --> 00:30:08,8
How dare you?

613
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:11,3
You have a hot tub on your balcony?

614
00:30:12,022 --> 00:30:14,3
No! Please don't jump on that,
it's Italian.

615
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:16,2
This is the coolest place ever!

616
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,2
Does your mother know you're--

617
00:30:18,031 --> 00:30:19,6
Does your mother know you're here?

618
00:30:21,044 --> 00:30:22,3
Yes?

619
00:30:22,098 --> 00:30:24,4
Well, what are you doing here?

620
00:30:25,028 --> 00:30:27,2
I came here to make sure you're okay.

621
00:30:29,061 --> 00:30:31,3
My mom said you needed a friend.

622
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:38,1
But it looks like you already have one.

623
00:30:39,042 --> 00:30:40,3
Hi.

624
00:30:41,004 --> 00:30:41,8
I'm Eve.

625
00:30:46,092 --> 00:30:47,9
[door clicks]

626
00:30:49,022 --> 00:30:51,1
Hey. Trixie ready?

627
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:53,4
Trix, Dad's here.

628
00:30:55,001 --> 00:30:56,1
How's the case going?

629
00:30:56,081 --> 00:30:57,8
[sighs]

630
00:30:58,027 --> 00:31:00,0
We know who the killer is but...

631
00:31:01,006 --> 00:31:02,0
we don't have proof.

632
00:31:02,023 --> 00:31:03,1
Who is it?

633
00:31:03,031 --> 00:31:05,8
[Chloe] Er, Julian's dad, Jacob Tiernan.

634
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,3
Jacob Tiernan.

635
00:31:08,095 --> 00:31:10,4
What, he killed somebody?

636
00:31:10,053 --> 00:31:13,3
He thought that Sam was the one
who broke Julian's back, so...

637
00:31:13,045 --> 00:31:15,5
-Simple revenge motive.
-You're sure about that?

638
00:31:16,016 --> 00:31:17,9
I mean, I didn't think
he was capable of...

639
00:31:19,008 --> 00:31:20,1
-of that.
-Trix.

640
00:31:20,058 --> 00:31:21,4
[Chloe] Trix?

641
00:31:21,067 --> 00:31:22,5
Come on.

642
00:31:22,067 --> 00:31:23,7
[door slides]

643
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,8
[Chloe] Dan.

644
00:31:27,071 --> 00:31:28,6
Dan!

645
00:31:29,001 --> 00:31:29,9
Yeah?

646
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,6
-Trixie snuck out and went to Lucifer's.
-What?

647
00:31:36,081 --> 00:31:37,8
Well...

648
00:31:37,093 --> 00:31:39,0
We've got to go find her.

649
00:31:39,073 --> 00:31:40,6
Now.

650
00:31:44,044 --> 00:31:45,5
Where do you live?

651
00:31:46,065 --> 00:31:47,4
Here.

652
00:31:48,044 --> 00:31:51,6
-Where are you from?
-Far away. I came here for Lucifer.

653
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:53,7
Keep the commentary to yourself, lady.

654
00:31:53,087 --> 00:31:56,0
-Have you ever been married?
-Yes, it didn't work out.

655
00:31:56,012 --> 00:31:57,6
-How come?
-We weren't right for each other.

656
00:31:57,074 --> 00:31:59,5
-What do you do for work?
-I don't.

657
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,0
Pretty much just get to be me.

658
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:03,5
Well, that's kind of cool.

659
00:32:04,054 --> 00:32:06,0
-Favorite color?
-Red. What's yours?

660
00:32:06,013 --> 00:32:07,5
I'm asking the questions.

661
00:32:08,017 --> 00:32:11,8
Would you excuse me whilst I do something
less mind-numbingly boring

662
00:32:11,093 --> 00:32:14,1
like color-sort my suits?

663
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,9
Are you the kind of friend
Lucifer needs right now?

664
00:32:23,031 --> 00:32:24,4
I hope so.

665
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:28,1
I care about him very much.

666
00:32:32,074 --> 00:32:35,1
[screams] Oh, my-- Lucifer!

667
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:37,9
I didn't think there'd be
anyone else here, but...

668
00:32:39,012 --> 00:32:40,5
can't have any witnesses.

669
00:32:40,087 --> 00:32:41,7
Oh, please...

670
00:32:42,062 --> 00:32:44,5
[glass shatters]

671
00:32:44,058 --> 00:32:46,2
[Eve screaming] Let's go! Let's go!

672
00:32:46,038 --> 00:32:49,4
[splintering of glass]

673
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,4
[thud]

674
00:32:51,005 --> 00:32:53,5
[gun shots]

675
00:32:53,084 --> 00:32:54,8
[groans]

676
00:32:56,014 --> 00:32:57,6
What are you?

677
00:32:59,022 --> 00:33:01,3
[groans]

678
00:33:01,093 --> 00:33:03,0
[groans]

679
00:33:03,018 --> 00:33:04,8
Tiernan sent you, didn't he?

680
00:33:04,098 --> 00:33:06,1
Yeah.

681
00:33:06,019 --> 00:33:08,1
-[elevator bell rings]
-[Dan] Where is she?

682
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:09,3
Where's Trixie?

683
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,6
She's safe. She's through there.

684
00:33:14,095 --> 00:33:16,0
Mommy! Daddy!

685
00:33:16,016 --> 00:33:18,5
[Trixie gasps] Sorry.

686
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,4
Monkey, you're okay.

687
00:33:23,096 --> 00:33:24,9
You're okay.

688
00:33:27,017 --> 00:33:28,5
[Chloe] I love you, honey.

689
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:32,4
[siren wailing]

690
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:49,4
I hope you know I would...

691
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:53,6
I would do anything to protect
that little urchin.

692
00:33:56,095 --> 00:33:57,8
I know.

693
00:33:58,066 --> 00:34:01,3
I also know what you're thinking
of doing to Tiernan.

694
00:34:02,033 --> 00:34:03,5
Especially now.

695
00:34:04,029 --> 00:34:06,7
And you, detective.

696
00:34:07,037 --> 00:34:10,2
Don't you want to punish him?
He almost killed your child.

697
00:34:11,009 --> 00:34:12,0
Yes.

698
00:34:13,038 --> 00:34:14,6
I do, yeah.

699
00:34:14,092 --> 00:34:17,4
But I'm gonna do it by following the rules

700
00:34:17,051 --> 00:34:18,3
because...

701
00:34:19,051 --> 00:34:21,8
I believe in right and wrong and...

702
00:34:22,064 --> 00:34:24,7
and deep down I think that...

703
00:34:26,035 --> 00:34:27,4
you do too.

704
00:34:31,031 --> 00:34:32,2
You're the devil.

705
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:36,3
But you're also an angel. [sighs]

706
00:34:37,082 --> 00:34:40,5
I'm not sure that I am an angel anymore.

707
00:34:41,016 --> 00:34:42,2
What do you mean?

708
00:34:43,091 --> 00:34:46,8
After I killed Pierce
when my devil face returned...

709
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:50,0
I never checked to see
if my wings were still there.

710
00:34:51,063 --> 00:34:52,7
I still haven't.

711
00:34:54,046 --> 00:34:55,7
Afraid that they're gone.

712
00:34:56,021 --> 00:34:57,4
For good reason.

713
00:35:00,026 --> 00:35:01,3
Well, you know...

714
00:35:02,072 --> 00:35:04,0
I think you should look.

715
00:35:06,031 --> 00:35:08,7
Maybe you'll be surprised
at what you find.

716
00:35:11,073 --> 00:35:13,1
[Eve] The police are done.

717
00:35:23,024 --> 00:35:24,3
[Chloe] Thank you.

718
00:35:25,091 --> 00:35:27,2
Thank you for Trixie.

719
00:35:29,004 --> 00:35:30,1
You're welcome.

720
00:35:42,076 --> 00:35:44,6
We're going to get this guy, right?

721
00:35:45,056 --> 00:35:46,7
I mean...

722
00:35:47,064 --> 00:35:49,4
we've been looking
for the worst of the worst.

723
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:50,5
Here it is.

724
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:56,1
You're right.

725
00:35:57,073 --> 00:36:00,4
It's time for Tiernan
to get what he deserves, but...

726
00:36:02,024 --> 00:36:03,7
I need to do this on my own.

727
00:36:05,024 --> 00:36:06,2
It's important to me.

728
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:09,2
Okay.

729
00:36:14,067 --> 00:36:15,5
You know, I...

730
00:36:17,004 --> 00:36:18,4
I only want us...

731
00:36:20,001 --> 00:36:20,9
you...

732
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,0
to be happy.

733
00:36:35,098 --> 00:36:39,0
We have you dead to rights
on attempted murder.

734
00:36:39,019 --> 00:36:41,7
So if you don't help us take down
who really killed Sam Zofrelli...

735
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:44,4
Well. It was your golden gun
used on the murder

736
00:36:44,057 --> 00:36:46,8
so you might be looking pretty damn good
for that, too.

737
00:36:48,045 --> 00:36:49,3
[sighs]

738
00:36:50,016 --> 00:36:51,7
Look, I love Julian.

739
00:36:52,025 --> 00:36:54,2
That's why I wanted to be the one
to kill Sam.

740
00:36:54,037 --> 00:36:56,1
But Julian's an idiot.

741
00:36:56,058 --> 00:36:58,5
He gets into trouble all the time...

742
00:36:59,025 --> 00:37:00,5
owed Sam a bunch of money.

743
00:37:00,067 --> 00:37:03,7
Is that why Tiernan thought Sam
was the one to break Julian's spine?

744
00:37:03,084 --> 00:37:04,6
[sighs]

745
00:37:04,076 --> 00:37:07,1
Tiernan wouldn't give Julian any money
to pay back Sam.

746
00:37:07,026 --> 00:37:09,7
So Julian had to give Sam
whatever he could,

747
00:37:10,006 --> 00:37:11,9
his car, his watch,

748
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:13,1
family heirlooms.

749
00:37:13,027 --> 00:37:14,3
Family heirlooms?

750
00:37:15,006 --> 00:37:15,9
Yeah.

751
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,5
It pissed Tiernan off,
but he still loved the kid.

752
00:37:19,023 --> 00:37:20,4
He's his son after all.

753
00:37:20,069 --> 00:37:22,1
But even after all that,

754
00:37:22,049 --> 00:37:24,7
Julian still couldn't come up
with enough to pay back Sam.

755
00:37:24,082 --> 00:37:27,4
[Dan] Right,
so after Julian's spine was broken...

756
00:37:28,049 --> 00:37:30,9
Tiernan thought Sam must have been
the one who did it...

757
00:37:31,058 --> 00:37:33,9
asked for the gun and then
got revenge himself?

758
00:37:34,016 --> 00:37:36,0
Too bad somebody else crippled Julian.

759
00:37:38,021 --> 00:37:39,0
What do you mean?

760
00:37:39,042 --> 00:37:41,0
Tiernan found out Lucifer did it.

761
00:37:42,042 --> 00:37:44,2
That's why he sent me to kill him.

762
00:37:44,072 --> 00:37:47,6
We thought that Tiernan was upset because
of Lucifer's behavior in the office.

763
00:37:47,072 --> 00:37:50,8
Where did he get the idea that Lucifer
was the one to break his back?

764
00:37:58,044 --> 00:37:59,3
No idea.

765
00:38:00,015 --> 00:38:02,9
[Chloe sighs] All right.
You said family heirlooms, right?

766
00:38:03,023 --> 00:38:05,3
Would that also include a family ring?

767
00:38:07,078 --> 00:38:08,6

Hello again, Tiernan.

776
00:38:33,085 --> 00:38:35,5
I told you this wasn't over.

777
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:38,2

the punishment that you deserve.

781
00:38:52,033 --> 00:38:54,6
What about that ring?

782
00:38:55,029 --> 00:38:58,1
No, the ring that Tiernan had on
had a family crest on it.

783
00:38:58,025 --> 00:39:01,7
Do you guys really think he would
wear it after taking it off a dead body?

784
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:02,9
It was a family ring,

785
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,9
so I t think Tiernan saw it as something
that was taken from him.

786
00:39:06,001 --> 00:39:09,8
So if we can prove that Sam had the ring
on his finger before he was killed

787
00:39:09,088 --> 00:39:12,4
and that it's now on Tiernan's hand,
we can arrest him.

788
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,1
Before anyone else gets to him.

789
00:39:15,026 --> 00:39:16,5
I think I've found it.

790
00:39:18,068 --> 00:39:19,8
Yes, that's it.

791
00:39:19,098 --> 00:39:22,3

I believe you're looking for this man.

794
00:39:45,017 --> 00:39:48,5
I happened to be walking
past Tiernan's office,

795
00:39:48,063 --> 00:39:51,0
and I overheard him talking about
leaving town.

796
00:39:51,009 --> 00:39:54,3
As a concerned citizen, I felt
it was my civic duty to bring him in...

797
00:39:55,022 --> 00:39:58,2
so he can properly face the punishment
he deserves.

798
00:40:01,002 --> 00:40:02,0
Why did you do it?

799
00:40:03,044 --> 00:40:07,2

I might have gone a bit too far recently.
