1
00:00:13,068 --> 00:00:17,3
[drink being poured]

2
00:00:21,022 --> 00:00:22,7
Forgive me, Father...

3
00:00:23,027 --> 00:00:24,7
for not offering you a drink.

4
00:00:25,073 --> 00:00:28,6
I have an aversion to the cloth. 
Daddy issues.

5
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:29,7
Long story.

6
00:00:29,082 --> 00:00:33,8
I understand, and I do apologize
for the intrusion, Mr. Morningstar.

7
00:00:34,065 --> 00:00:36,2
Please allow me to explain myself.

8
00:00:36,053 --> 00:00:37,9
Excellent course of action.

9
00:00:38,053 --> 00:00:41,1
You see, I'm not a normal priest.

10
00:00:41,033 --> 00:00:43,7
[laughing] Was there ever such a thing?

11
00:00:44,008 --> 00:00:45,9
I mean I'm not a normal priest
in the sense

12
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:48,2
that I don't have my own congregation.

13
00:00:49,025 --> 00:00:50,1
I am a...

14
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:51,9
I'm an investigator.

15
00:00:52,084 --> 00:00:53,6
For the Vatican.

16
00:00:56,063 --> 00:00:58,0
Vatican investigator?

17
00:00:58,051 --> 00:01:00,6
Sounds like a soon-to-be-canceled
TV show.

18
00:01:00,097 --> 00:01:02,7
I assure you, it's a very real job.

19
00:01:03,027 --> 00:01:06,6
I've spent the last 40 years traveling
the globe in pursuit of the demonic.

20
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:09,2
I know the divine is real.

21
00:01:09,094 --> 00:01:12,3
And I also know that evil walks the earth.

22
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,1
And that you, Mr. Morningstar--

23
00:01:14,028 --> 00:01:16,0
Oh, brother, here we go.

24
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,0
Are not it.

25
00:01:19,095 --> 00:01:21,5
Not quite what I was expecting.

26
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:26,3
So if I'm not the devil,
then why are you here?

27
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:29,2
And what does any of this
have to do with the Detective?

28
00:01:29,038 --> 00:01:31,3
Because Miss Decker believes that you are.

29
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,6
I see.

30
00:01:33,071 --> 00:01:36,8
About a month ago, she came to Rome
with a most outlandish tale.

31
00:01:37,084 --> 00:01:40,2
The devil himself
is hiding in plain sight,

32
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,3
masquerading as a nightclub owner
in Los Angeles,

33
00:01:43,043 --> 00:01:46,7
and that he'd revealed himself to her.

34
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:48,9
Well...

35
00:01:49,031 --> 00:01:50,6
this is wonderful news.

36
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,1
Wonderful? How so?

37
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:55,1
Well, as my therapist would say--
I know, so LA...

38
00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:58,2
But she'd say
that talking about your issues

39
00:01:58,028 --> 00:01:59,9
was the first step in dealing with them,

40
00:02:00,003 --> 00:02:02,4
so if the Detective did have issues
with me...

41
00:02:03,003 --> 00:02:04,4
sounds like they've been dealt with.

42
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:08,0
Now, if that's everything, Father,
you can be on your merry way.

43
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:11,0
I just felt that it was my duty 
to warn you.

44
00:02:12,013 --> 00:02:14,9
Because the reason that she came to Rome
was to, well...

45
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:17,2
send the devil back to hell.

46
00:02:17,047 --> 00:02:18,3
[laughs]

47
00:02:19,068 --> 00:02:20,9
The Detective would never do that.

48
00:02:21,026 --> 00:02:23,2
Chloe is a good person with a good heart.

49
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,3
Finally, something we can agree on.

50
00:02:25,043 --> 00:02:28,4
But whatever she went through,
whatever drove her to Rome...

51
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:30,5
it shook her to her very core.

52
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:34,1
She's the reason that I'm here.

53
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:39,3
You need to be careful, Mr. Morningstar.

54
00:02:41,003 --> 00:02:42,9
God knows what she has planned for you.

55
00:02:55,067 --> 00:03:00,0
[humming quietly]

56
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,3
[Ella]
What are you so cheery about, Decker?

57
00:03:04,043 --> 00:03:05,2
What?

58
00:03:05,068 --> 00:03:07,9
-I'm not cheery.
-Wait, why aren't you cheery?

59
00:03:08,002 --> 00:03:10,0
I've been nursing a bad one all day.

60
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:12,4
Ha! What? Too much Romulan ale?

61
00:03:12,052 --> 00:03:13,8
Too much tequila.

62
00:03:14,044 --> 00:03:17,4
I went a little nutso
on all the margeritas yesterday.

63
00:03:17,086 --> 00:03:21,3
Yesterday, Sunday...
Did you swap out the sacramental wine?

64
00:03:21,065 --> 00:03:23,3
I skipped church yesterday.

65
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,0
And the week before, you said.

66
00:03:26,028 --> 00:03:29,5
Listen, Ella,
I sort of wanted to check in with you,

67
00:03:30,021 --> 00:03:32,1
-to see--
-You know, it's just...

68
00:03:32,058 --> 00:03:34,8
me and the big guy
are on a bit of a break.

69
00:03:34,092 --> 00:03:38,0
I completely... understand.
I mean, more than you'll ever know.

70
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:39,1
In fact...

71
00:03:39,067 --> 00:03:40,5
recently...

72
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:43,9
I got clarity on a very similar issue.

73
00:03:44,068 --> 00:03:45,5
And...

74
00:03:46,014 --> 00:03:48,3
I think it's why I've been feeling
so positive lately.

75
00:03:48,051 --> 00:03:49,7
-[bang]
-[man's voice] Enough!

76
00:03:49,085 --> 00:03:51,1
Stop calling me!

77
00:03:52,048 --> 00:03:53,3
Jeez.

78
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:54,9
Hang on.

79
00:03:55,065 --> 00:03:56,6
Is everything okay?

80
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:58,1
[phone buzzes]

81
00:03:58,019 --> 00:03:59,5
-Everything's fine.
-[phone buzzes]

82
00:03:59,082 --> 00:04:01,4
Well, are you going to answer that?

83
00:04:01,053 --> 00:04:02,4
Absolutely not.

84
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,9
Dan, it could be important.

85
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:05,6
Be my guest.

86
00:04:06,032 --> 00:04:07,1
Okay.

87
00:04:08,012 --> 00:04:08,9
Dan's phone.

88
00:04:09,004 --> 00:04:10,8
[gurgling roar on phone]

89
00:04:12,075 --> 00:04:13,6
What the hell is that?

90
00:04:14,092 --> 00:04:16,2
I'll show you what that was.

91
00:04:18,071 --> 00:04:19,7
Yeah.

92
00:04:20,013 --> 00:04:21,1
That's my phone number.

93
00:04:22,013 --> 00:04:24,5
Lucifer's been posting these
all over the precinct.

94
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:26,8
It's not funny, Chloe.

95
00:04:27,047 --> 00:04:29,1
I swear he only exists to...

96
00:04:30,006 --> 00:04:30,8
torture me.

97
00:04:31,077 --> 00:04:35,0
Look, I know you and Lucifer
have had your issues lately,

98
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,9
but maybe this is his way of--

99
00:04:36,098 --> 00:04:39,5
Know what? I'm sick and tired
of everybody making excuses for him.

100
00:04:40,028 --> 00:04:43,1
I wish you could just see
a little bit of what I see, Chloe.

101
00:04:44,074 --> 00:04:45,5
He's...

102
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:48,0
he's a bad guy.

103
00:04:48,066 --> 00:04:49,5
He's...

104
00:04:50,054 --> 00:04:51,6
he's trying to be better.

105
00:04:52,066 --> 00:04:54,2
He... in his own way.

106
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,6
[Dan] Whatever.

107
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:04,7
[ambient pop playing in the background]

108
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:10,9
Brother.

109
00:05:11,043 --> 00:05:12,7
You look like I feel.

110
00:05:12,085 --> 00:05:16,3
No, I'm pretty sure that my issues
are much bigger than yours. Trust me.

111
00:05:16,044 --> 00:05:18,5
I think we all know
nothing is bigger than mine.

112
00:05:19,006 --> 00:05:21,1
-The strangest thing just happened--
-Linda's pregnant.

113
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:24,8
We'll call it a tie. [chuckles]

114
00:05:26,003 --> 00:05:27,3
Are you sure it's yours?

115
00:05:27,045 --> 00:05:28,8
Lucy, Linda's not like that.

116
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:30,5
You of all people should know.

117
00:05:30,066 --> 00:05:32,3
Relax, brother, I just meant...

118
00:05:32,095 --> 00:05:35,2
a celestial impregnating a human--

119
00:05:35,071 --> 00:05:36,7
How is it even possible?

120
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:39,4
And, if it is,
how has this not already happened to you?

121
00:05:39,092 --> 00:05:41,0
[Lucifer] True.

122
00:05:41,088 --> 00:05:42,7
Mm.

123
00:05:44,001 --> 00:05:45,7
Maybe there's another explanation.

124
00:05:46,001 --> 00:05:48,1
You think Linda's an angel in disguise,
don't you?

125
00:05:48,026 --> 00:05:50,7
I've been wondering the same thing.
Maybe she's not even human.

126
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,3
Or, maybe, when you lost your wings,
you became as mortal as it gets.

127
00:05:55,085 --> 00:05:58,1
Maybe you became more human
than you realized.

128
00:05:59,002 --> 00:05:59,8
Oh.

129
00:06:00,015 --> 00:06:01,4
Probably makes more sense.

130
00:06:01,052 --> 00:06:02,4
[Lucifer laughs]

131
00:06:02,057 --> 00:06:04,6
I bet you regret coming back now,
eh, brother?

132
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:07,3
Absolutely not.
Quite the opposite in fact.

133
00:06:07,061 --> 00:06:10,7
Oh, come on, you don't have to sell me.
You can join the Navy for all I care.

134
00:06:10,087 --> 00:06:12,7
Lucy, I am happy to be here.

135
00:06:13,091 --> 00:06:15,5
Don't you see? I'm going to be a father.

136
00:06:17,012 --> 00:06:20,0
Well, if you're so happy, then
what are you doing hiding out in my bar?

137
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:22,6
Because I have absolutely no idea
what to do.

138
00:06:24,013 --> 00:06:25,0
I mean...

139
00:06:26,026 --> 00:06:27,3
where do I even begin?

140
00:06:27,047 --> 00:06:29,0
Wrong tree, I'm afraid.

141
00:06:29,084 --> 00:06:33,6
But you are here on Earth,
so, if it's any consolation,

142
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:35,4
you couldn't do worse than our father.

143
00:06:35,081 --> 00:06:39,0
-How do you know that?
-Because ours was literally never there.

144
00:06:42,048 --> 00:06:44,3
-Hey, where've you been?
-What do you mean?

145
00:06:44,073 --> 00:06:47,3
Well, I sent you that text
about rescheduling our date.

146
00:06:47,044 --> 00:06:50,4
Oh, yes, right.
Definitely, no, I'd like that.

147
00:06:50,049 --> 00:06:52,2
Okay, great. Good.

148
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:54,1
Is everything okay?

149
00:06:54,033 --> 00:06:57,5
Yes, just feeling a little parched
and my flask has apparently disappeared.

150
00:06:57,058 --> 00:06:58,7
You know, I've been thinking.

151
00:06:59,046 --> 00:07:01,6
Maybe it's best
if you don't drink so much.

152
00:07:02,042 --> 00:07:04,1
You know, at least while we're working.

153
00:07:04,021 --> 00:07:05,0
Ah.

154
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:06,5
I see what this is about.

155
00:07:06,067 --> 00:07:07,7
-You do?
-Yes.

156
00:07:07,084 --> 00:07:09,5
And you needn't worry, Detective.

157
00:07:09,063 --> 00:07:13,1
Unbelievable as it may seem, being
the actual devil does have its downsides.

158
00:07:13,059 --> 00:07:15,8
I can't get drunk on normal,
human amounts of alcohol.

159
00:07:16,031 --> 00:07:17,8
I only drink because I like the taste.

160
00:07:17,089 --> 00:07:19,8
Well, I'm... but people don't know that.
[laughs]

161
00:07:20,052 --> 00:07:22,1
What do I care what other people think?

162
00:07:22,023 --> 00:07:24,4
I'm just saying showing people
that you can change is--

163
00:07:24,052 --> 00:07:26,0
Ah, here it is!

164
00:07:26,023 --> 00:07:27,1
[laughs]

165
00:07:27,044 --> 00:07:28,4
Wrong pocket.

166
00:07:29,024 --> 00:07:30,1
Shall we?

167
00:07:31,024 --> 00:07:33,9
[camera shutter clicks]

168
00:07:34,024 --> 00:07:36,1
Hey, Ella. Are you feeling better today?

169
00:07:36,024 --> 00:07:38,1
[Ella sighs]
Well, better than this poor girl.

170
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:43,6
Susan Ochoa, 29. A bona fide
rocket scientist at Brody Aerospace.

171
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:47,3
Neighbor saw the door open,
body on the floor, called it in.

172
00:07:47,063 --> 00:07:49,6
-I'm assuming that's the murder weapon.
-Yep.

173
00:07:49,076 --> 00:07:51,4
A good old knife in the back.

174
00:07:51,067 --> 00:07:52,8
Bit on the nose.

175
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:55,4
So no forced entry...

176
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,4
two glasses,

177
00:07:57,056 --> 00:07:58,7
someone brought flowers.

178
00:07:59,014 --> 00:08:00,4
She knew her attacker.

179
00:08:00,052 --> 00:08:03,5
It's always the ones you least suspect,
the ones you trust the most,

180
00:08:03,081 --> 00:08:04,7
that hurt you.

181
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:08,5
[Ella] They wait until your guard is down
and then wham!

182
00:08:09,028 --> 00:08:10,6
In my case, it was tequila.

183
00:08:11,011 --> 00:08:11,9
Riveting.

184
00:08:13,024 --> 00:08:14,1
Any witnesses?

185
00:08:14,032 --> 00:08:16,4
None, but the victim's friend
might know more.

186
00:08:17,033 --> 00:08:18,1
Oscar.

187
00:08:19,004 --> 00:08:22,2
Do you know anyone who would have wanted
to hurt Susan, Mr. Rivas?

188
00:08:23,012 --> 00:08:24,9
No. Everybody liked Susan.

189
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,6
Who did she trust the most?

190
00:08:26,075 --> 00:08:29,6
To be honest, I don't know much 
about Susan's life here.

191
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:32,9
I just came from El Salvador. She was
supposed to pick me up from the airport.

192
00:08:33,001 --> 00:08:34,8
When she didn't show, I came here and...

193
00:08:36,022 --> 00:08:37,1
I saw all of this.

194
00:08:37,035 --> 00:08:39,3
-And how do you know her?
-[Oscar] We were in a gang.

195
00:08:40,035 --> 00:08:41,2
Los Xs.

196
00:08:41,031 --> 00:08:45,0
A gang member turned rocket scientist.
Gosh, and I thought I had range.

197
00:08:45,027 --> 00:08:47,4
When I left the life,
I wanted to pay it forward.

198
00:08:47,052 --> 00:08:50,1
So I helped people like Susan
get out and get clean.

199
00:08:50,023 --> 00:08:51,4
She was a drug addict?

200
00:08:51,086 --> 00:08:53,7
Don't judge her. A lot of us were.

201
00:08:53,086 --> 00:08:55,7
Oh, I'm not judging. I love drugs.

202
00:08:55,078 --> 00:08:58,2
In fact, do you think she might have any
lying around? [giggles]

203
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:01,7
Do you know if Susan
still had any connection to Los Xs?

204
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,2
No, she made a clean break.

205
00:09:03,037 --> 00:09:07,0
She moved here, went to school,
made an amazing life for herself.

206
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:12,6
Promise me you will punish
the son of a bitch that did this.

207
00:09:12,071 --> 00:09:13,5
Oh...

208
00:09:14,013 --> 00:09:15,0
with pleasure.

209
00:09:15,068 --> 00:09:18,8
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Rivas.
We'll be in touch if we need anything.

210
00:09:18,093 --> 00:09:22,1
You take him. Let's get in touch with
next of kin and head back to the precinct.

211
00:09:22,018 --> 00:09:23,3
I meant what I said earlier.

212
00:09:23,072 --> 00:09:24,6
What do you mean?

213
00:09:24,068 --> 00:09:27,2
That I don't care
what people think about me.

214
00:09:27,094 --> 00:09:32,2
So if you want to talk to anyone about,
you know, me being the devil... [laughs]

215
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,0
That is if you haven't already, then,
just know that it is totally fine with me.

216
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:39,2
Okay. I don't think that's necessary.

217
00:09:39,028 --> 00:09:41,7
Right.
So you haven't told anyone about me?

218
00:09:42,037 --> 00:09:43,2
No.

219
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:44,9
No, not a soul.

220
00:10:00,051 --> 00:10:01,8
[female] She's a monster.

221
00:10:02,026 --> 00:10:04,7
Demanding, complains all the time.

222
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:07,5
It's like nothing is ever good enough.

223
00:10:07,081 --> 00:10:10,4
And how old is Brooklyn now?

224
00:10:10,081 --> 00:10:16,1
Three. You know, sometimes I catch her
looking at me like she knows she's won.

225
00:10:16,028 --> 00:10:17,9
It can't be all bad.

226
00:10:18,074 --> 00:10:20,0
-Can it?
-Don't you get it?

227
00:10:20,011 --> 00:10:21,3
She's a sociopath.

228
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:24,1
Children are all sociopaths.

229
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,0
[door opens]

230
00:10:25,012 --> 00:10:26,5
[Lucifer sighs] Time's up.

231
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:29,1
Apologies, I've more pressing matters
to discuss with the doctor.

232
00:10:29,021 --> 00:10:30,9
I'm in the middle of my session here.

233
00:10:31,004 --> 00:10:34,1
Well, the doctor is with child.
She needs her rest.

234
00:10:34,025 --> 00:10:36,4
How dare you burden her
with your petty concerns, now?

235
00:10:36,051 --> 00:10:37,7
Run along. Come on, shoo!

236
00:10:37,097 --> 00:10:39,3
-[patient squeaks]
-Shoo.

237
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:41,7
-[patient squeaks]
-[door bangs]

238
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:43,0
So...

239
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:45,4
I hear congratulations are in order.

240
00:10:45,056 --> 00:10:48,5
Some people claim
to find the life-long burden fulfilling.

241
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:51,8
I'd rather not talk about the pregnancy
at work, if you don't mind.

242
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,6
Lips sealed. So, about me...

243
00:10:55,032 --> 00:10:58,0
What do you do
when someone has betrayed you?

244
00:10:58,015 --> 00:11:01,5
Normally I'd go straight to punishment,
fire, brimstone,

245
00:11:01,066 --> 00:11:03,3
public humiliation via YouTube.

246
00:11:03,045 --> 00:11:06,6
But in this case,
the subject happens to be none other...

247
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,3
than the Detective.

248
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,2
Wait, Chloe?

249
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:10,6
What did she do?

250
00:11:10,071 --> 00:11:12,4
I caught her in a lie.

251
00:11:13,004 --> 00:11:15,7
A most heinous transgression.

252
00:11:16,034 --> 00:11:18,6
Oh, and she may be plotting
to send me back to hell.

253
00:11:18,076 --> 00:11:21,3
Okay, that's a very serious accusation.

254
00:11:22,026 --> 00:11:24,7
-How do you know this?
-A complete stranger told me.

255
00:11:26,035 --> 00:11:27,9
Have you talked to Chloe about this?

256
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:30,7
Well, she's lied once.
What's to stop her from lying again?

257
00:11:30,081 --> 00:11:32,9
I just need you to tell me
how to deal with her.

258
00:11:33,006 --> 00:11:34,9
Cautiously, Lucifer.

259
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:38,8
There may be a very reasonable explanation
for Chloe's behavior.

260
00:11:39,028 --> 00:11:41,9
Like a spouse who suspects
their partner's been cheating,

261
00:11:42,053 --> 00:11:46,5
an accusation of betrayal
is a bell that can't be un-rung.

262
00:11:47,012 --> 00:11:48,5
Translation, doctor?

263
00:11:49,016 --> 00:11:50,4
Feel her out a bit.

264
00:11:57,009 --> 00:12:01,4
Susan survived Los Xs and then made it
as an engineer at Brody Aerospace.

265
00:12:01,063 --> 00:12:03,2
I think I've got myself a new hero.

266
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:05,1
I find it pretty pathetic.

267
00:12:05,051 --> 00:12:07,1
That's a little dark, don't you think?

268
00:12:07,022 --> 00:12:10,2
I mean, it's great
that a former criminal got clean

269
00:12:10,031 --> 00:12:11,8
and figured out her life, but for what?

270
00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:14,2
Dan, it's about the journey,
not the destination.

271
00:12:14,031 --> 00:12:16,4
[Dan laughs] She did all that work...

272
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:20,1
turned her life around, just to get shot
and killed for no reason at all.

273
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:21,9
You mean stabbed.

274
00:12:22,057 --> 00:12:23,9
Yeah, yeah. I didn't--

275
00:12:24,007 --> 00:12:25,3
I know what you meant.

276
00:12:26,062 --> 00:12:27,7
I really miss Charlotte too.

277
00:12:29,016 --> 00:12:31,0
And, hey, if you ever...

278
00:12:31,091 --> 00:12:35,2
need to talk, seriously,
or you just need a hug or...

279
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:38,3
-Sometimes, there's comfort--
-No, no, don't, don't.

280
00:12:38,046 --> 00:12:41,5
Don't start, Ella, with the whole
"it's all part of his grand plan,

281
00:12:41,063 --> 00:12:44,3
mysterious ways" crap right now, okay,
I just--

282
00:12:44,047 --> 00:12:46,6
I wasn't going to say any of that.

283
00:12:47,051 --> 00:12:49,4
I... Honestly...

284
00:12:50,014 --> 00:12:52,4
I'm not sure
if that's what I believe anymore.

285
00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:55,1
Right. Could have fooled me.

286
00:12:59,082 --> 00:13:00,8
Fair enough.

287
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,7
Look, I'm sorry, Ella, I didn't--

288
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:07,7
No, no, you're right.
Practice what you preach.

289
00:13:09,024 --> 00:13:10,2
And right now...

290
00:13:11,058 --> 00:13:13,9
I'm not sure what I'm preaching.

291
00:13:18,025 --> 00:13:19,1
What's in the file?

292
00:13:19,084 --> 00:13:23,3
Ah... flowers found at the crime scene.

293
00:13:24,088 --> 00:13:25,9
Bismarck hyacinths.

294
00:13:26,084 --> 00:13:28,9
Rare, only found in five flower markets,

295
00:13:29,005 --> 00:13:31,2
one of which sold the bouquet
the night of the murder.

296
00:13:31,031 --> 00:13:32,4
Do we know who bought them?

297
00:13:32,072 --> 00:13:36,3
Well, receipts track to the credit card
of tech genius-cum-billionaire,

298
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:38,8
owner of Brody Aerospace, Anders Brody.

299
00:13:39,048 --> 00:13:40,8
Susan Ochoa's boss.

300
00:13:42,044 --> 00:13:44,8
-Erm, I'll tell Chloe.
-Okay.

301
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:01,5
A bit self-aggrandizing, don't you think?

302
00:14:01,063 --> 00:14:03,1
Maybe he's compensating for something.

303
00:14:03,025 --> 00:14:07,2
Cue relentless onslaught
of small penis jokes in three, two, one...

304
00:14:10,022 --> 00:14:12,5
-You know, because he's compensating.
-For his guilt, I mean.

305
00:14:12,064 --> 00:14:13,6
[Chloe] Well, I thought...

306
00:14:13,072 --> 00:14:15,1
okay, well, never mind.

307
00:14:15,068 --> 00:14:19,6
So you think that he's hosting charity
regattas because he's feeling guilty?

308
00:14:19,073 --> 00:14:20,5
Yes.

309
00:14:20,065 --> 00:14:24,9
For doing bad things, like betraying
a beloved and totally innocent coworker.

310
00:14:25,053 --> 00:14:28,4
You know, 
maybe you and Anders are similar.

311
00:14:28,061 --> 00:14:31,6
Rich, famous.
At the very least, notorious.

312
00:14:31,074 --> 00:14:34,4
No, no, you're supposed to be Brody
in this metaphor.

313
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:38,9
Have you ever considered donating
any of your vast fortune to charity?

314
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:39,9
[scoffs]

315
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,8
I've put many a nubile law student
through college, thank you very much,

316
00:14:42,096 --> 00:14:45,4
several of which were named Charity, so...

317
00:14:46,076 --> 00:14:49,9
[Chloe] Ah, hard to believe
a guy so dedicated to saving the world

318
00:14:50,005 --> 00:14:51,3
would murder his own employee.

319
00:14:52,043 --> 00:14:55,1
Well, sometimes betrayal
come from the ones we expect the least,

320
00:14:55,018 --> 00:14:56,3
doesn't it, Detective?

321
00:14:58,014 --> 00:14:59,3
[Lucifer shouts] You!

322
00:14:59,081 --> 00:15:01,1
Anders Brody.

323
00:15:01,044 --> 00:15:02,5
You killed her, didn't you?

324
00:15:03,031 --> 00:15:04,5
Killed? Who?

325
00:15:04,086 --> 00:15:06,9
-[bottle splashes]
-Susan Ochoa.

326
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,6
You went round to her place
and murdered her in cold blood.

327
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,7
[Anders scoffs]

328
00:15:10,082 --> 00:15:12,7
Are you out of your mind? Who are you?

329
00:15:12,087 --> 00:15:16,2
LAPD. We're here investigating the murder
of your employee Susan Ochoa.

330
00:15:16,033 --> 00:15:17,1
Look...

331
00:15:17,058 --> 00:15:19,5
I don't even know who that is, so...

332
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,1
-I certainly didn't kill her.
-[Chloe] What happened?

333
00:15:22,092 --> 00:15:25,0
You go over to her place,
try and put the moves on her?

334
00:15:25,017 --> 00:15:27,5
She wasn't into it, you couldn't take it
and killed her?

335
00:15:27,076 --> 00:15:29,8
I don't know her.

336
00:15:30,022 --> 00:15:31,5
We know about the flowers.

337
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,7
They tracked back to you.

338
00:15:34,035 --> 00:15:35,7
[Lucifer] Don't think so!

339
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,7
[Chloe] Lucifer, what are you doing?

340
00:15:38,022 --> 00:15:39,6
-[rope whips]
-[Anders groans]

341
00:15:39,073 --> 00:15:41,3
-[grunts]
-[rope whips]

342
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:44,0
-[engine starts]
-[grunts]

343
00:15:44,015 --> 00:15:46,0
Susan invited you into her home...

344
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:47,1
[Anders groans]

345
00:15:47,023 --> 00:15:49,1
...her life, and you betrayed her.

346
00:15:50,011 --> 00:15:52,2
Do something! He's going to kill me!

347
00:15:52,036 --> 00:15:56,2
Lucifer, there may be a less violent way
of getting him to talk.

348
00:15:56,028 --> 00:15:57,9
Okay. Alright, alright, alright.

349
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,5
I betrayed Susan.

350
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,6
[Anders gasps]

351
00:16:01,071 --> 00:16:03,1
But it's not what you think.

352
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:04,3
Please.

353
00:16:04,071 --> 00:16:06,0
-[Lucifer] Fine.
-[snap]

354
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:07,2
-[Anders gasps]
-[thud]

355
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:09,7
[Anders coughs]

356
00:16:10,013 --> 00:16:12,3
Thank you for your honesty.
I like honesty.

357
00:16:12,084 --> 00:16:15,1
Now, if you wouldn't mind sharing with us

358
00:16:15,022 --> 00:16:18,4
a sympathetic and logical explanation
for your betrayal.

359
00:16:19,001 --> 00:16:20,8
Not another word without my lawyers.

360
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:23,1
[Anders pants]

361
00:16:25,065 --> 00:16:28,2
Is it true that human spawn
erupt from their mothers' bodies

362
00:16:28,036 --> 00:16:31,1
in a ceremony of blood and pain?

363
00:16:32,086 --> 00:16:34,0
What? No.

364
00:16:34,066 --> 00:16:35,7
[sighs] In hell...

365
00:16:36,032 --> 00:16:37,7
torture via birth was a favorite.

366
00:16:38,037 --> 00:16:40,1
If half of what we did is accurate...

367
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,6
your sex holes are never going back
to normal.

368
00:16:42,071 --> 00:16:44,2
Okay, Maze, erm...

369
00:16:45,017 --> 00:16:46,4
That's enough, thank you.

370
00:16:46,092 --> 00:16:49,7
And the birth is many, many...

371
00:16:50,084 --> 00:16:52,6
many months from now.

372
00:16:52,084 --> 00:16:54,5
[Maze] Yeah, but I have questions, Linda.

373
00:16:54,063 --> 00:16:57,3
Things I don't want to know,
things I need to know.

374
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:00,9
And there will be plenty of time
to have all of your questions answered

375
00:17:01,006 --> 00:17:02,3
by someone else.

376
00:17:02,093 --> 00:17:06,8
But it's just too soon
to be dealing with all of... this.

377
00:17:06,094 --> 00:17:09,4
And, besides, I have a client
that should be arriving any minute.

378
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:11,6
Whatever. You're lying.

379
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:13,7
This is your lunch hour,

380
00:17:14,003 --> 00:17:17,0
where you eat your lunch and...
ogle hot guys on Tinder.

381
00:17:17,074 --> 00:17:18,8
Of course, pretty soon,

382
00:17:18,091 --> 00:17:22,3
you'll be using this hour
attached to one of those milking devices.

383
00:17:22,045 --> 00:17:24,4
Oh-wah, oh-wah...

384
00:17:24,054 --> 00:17:26,2
[laughs] We used to use those too.

385
00:17:26,075 --> 00:17:30,4
In fact, we hooked this guy up to it once.
It was--

386
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,5
Okay, goodbye, Maze.

387
00:17:32,076 --> 00:17:33,8
Okay.

388
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:37,5
[door clicks]

389
00:17:37,068 --> 00:17:38,5
[sighs]

390
00:17:40,072 --> 00:17:43,6
That must have been such a relief
for him to come clean.

391
00:17:45,014 --> 00:17:49,1
Who knows? Maybe next time we try to
get him to confess in a less violent way.

392
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:50,6
Where's the fun in that?

393
00:17:51,019 --> 00:17:54,5
At the very least, next time maybe we...

394
00:17:54,099 --> 00:17:57,2
try and get him to confess
more specifically.

395
00:17:57,028 --> 00:17:59,4
"I betrayed her," 
can mean a lot of things.

396
00:18:00,053 --> 00:18:01,9
You're right. You're right.

397
00:18:02,008 --> 00:18:05,2
Maybe we should brainstorm
a list of betrayals. You start, Detective.

398
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:06,9
[phone rings]

399
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:07,8
Oh.

400
00:18:08,025 --> 00:18:09,3
Hey, Ella. What's up?

401
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:12,0
Anders Brody didn't kill Susan Ochoa.

402
00:18:12,021 --> 00:18:14,0
[Chloe]  What? How do you know that?

403
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:18,5
Because, while Brody's been in custody,
the real killer just struck again.

404
00:18:23,051 --> 00:18:25,6
[Ella] Victim's name is David Ramirez.

405
00:18:25,077 --> 00:18:28,6
27, apprentice mechanic,
lived in the back of the shop.

406
00:18:30,023 --> 00:18:32,1
-[Chloe] Is this what I think it is?
-[Ella] Yep.

407
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:37,0
Tattoos that were removed
and their designs look like...

408
00:18:37,057 --> 00:18:38,9
[Dan] Los X's gang tats.

409
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:41,4
Apparently Ramirez grew up
in foster homes,

410
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:44,3
he got mixed up with the wrong crowd,
got arrested a bunch of times,

411
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,7
but, four years ago,

412
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:48,8
he goes to night school,
gets his mechanic certification

413
00:18:48,096 --> 00:18:50,3
and he's been clean ever since.

414
00:18:50,042 --> 00:18:52,1
[slaps file] Damn it.

415
00:18:52,054 --> 00:18:53,8
-What's wrong?
-He's just...

416
00:18:53,096 --> 00:18:54,8
[hits desk]

417
00:18:54,088 --> 00:18:56,8
Just trying to clean up his life,
you know, like...

418
00:18:57,038 --> 00:18:58,4
Susan Ochoa.

419
00:18:58,051 --> 00:19:01,0
Okay, let's focus on the things
we can control,

420
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,3
like stopping the killer
from striking again.

421
00:19:03,047 --> 00:19:06,5
We know that all the victims were linked
by their former gang,

422
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:09,5
so maybe it's someone from their past.
But what's the motive?

423
00:19:10,027 --> 00:19:11,4
Retribution maybe.

424
00:19:11,069 --> 00:19:14,6
Well, then let's talk to the former crew,
see if anyone knows anything.

425
00:19:14,098 --> 00:19:18,2
Los Xs aren't dumb corner boys anymore.
They're a major drug operation.

426
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:20,1
Which means they have lawyers,

427
00:19:20,024 --> 00:19:22,9
and without air-tight warrants
or full SWAT backup...

428
00:19:23,012 --> 00:19:24,2
they'll stonewall us.

429
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:26,1
You're absolutely right,
so I'll call a judge,

430
00:19:26,037 --> 00:19:28,2
get a warrant.
That might take a couple of days.

431
00:19:28,087 --> 00:19:31,9
But... Dan, I know what this is about,
okay?

432
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:35,0
There's nothing we can do
until we get a warrant.

433
00:19:35,096 --> 00:19:36,8
Okay.

434
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:40,6
Has anyone seen Lucifer?

435
00:19:41,022 --> 00:19:42,4
[door opens]

436
00:19:42,051 --> 00:19:43,8
[Lucifer] I'll take it from here.

437
00:19:43,093 --> 00:19:45,9
-No, don't touch me!
-I'll take it from here.

438
00:19:46,026 --> 00:19:49,8
Relax, your neck is fine.
It's your guilt I want to get a grip on.

439
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:54,6
You said you betrayed Susan, so if you
didn't kill her, what did you do?

440
00:19:54,073 --> 00:19:56,7
Look, I think it's best
if you just speak with my--

441
00:19:56,086 --> 00:20:00,0
You went to Susan's that evening
for a reason, so tell me.

442
00:20:01,032 --> 00:20:02,4
What did you desire?

443
00:20:04,032 --> 00:20:05,2
I wanted...

444
00:20:06,028 --> 00:20:07,1
Mm?

445
00:20:08,008 --> 00:20:09,6
I wanted...

446
00:20:10,045 --> 00:20:11,2
forgiveness.

447
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,9
Forgiveness? Why?

448
00:20:15,042 --> 00:20:17,2
One day I came upon Susan

449
00:20:17,034 --> 00:20:19,8
as she was talking
to some at-risk youth group

450
00:20:20,038 --> 00:20:22,8
about her past,
her struggles with addiction.

451
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:25,2
I had no idea and I panicked.

452
00:20:25,043 --> 00:20:26,8
Imagine the PR crisis.

453
00:20:26,089 --> 00:20:29,1
Head of Safety Protocols, a drug addict.

454
00:20:29,064 --> 00:20:33,0
So I demoted her,
took her off the NASA project.

455
00:20:33,056 --> 00:20:35,9
You punished her for her former life.

456
00:20:36,073 --> 00:20:38,1
But then I went through her file

457
00:20:38,023 --> 00:20:41,9
and I found that Susan
was a model employee

458
00:20:42,003 --> 00:20:45,5
and she'd passed every single drug test,
including the one last week.

459
00:20:46,087 --> 00:20:49,9
-It wasn't right, what I did to her.
-So you went over to apologize.

460
00:20:50,008 --> 00:20:52,1
But when I got there, it was too late.

461
00:20:54,037 --> 00:20:55,2
[sighs]

462
00:20:55,037 --> 00:20:56,4
She was dead.

463
00:20:58,092 --> 00:20:59,8
I was wrong.

464
00:21:01,092 --> 00:21:02,8
Oh.

465
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:04,7
[Anders] Never said that before.

466
00:21:05,034 --> 00:21:07,2
[Anders sighs]

467
00:21:07,034 --> 00:21:08,4
It feels good, man.

468
00:21:09,055 --> 00:21:10,6
It feels real good.

469
00:21:11,001 --> 00:21:12,9
I'm sure it does.

470
00:21:14,018 --> 00:21:15,2
Anyway...

471
00:21:16,006 --> 00:21:16,9
you're free to go.

472
00:21:18,052 --> 00:21:19,4
Thanks.

473
00:21:23,069 --> 00:21:25,4
Were you just hugging Anders Brody?

474
00:21:25,053 --> 00:21:27,5
Whatever it takes to get answers,
Detective.

475
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,5
Huh!

476
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:30,0
That's very evolved of you.

477
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,0
Mm.

478
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,2
Well, we're still waiting on warrants

479
00:21:33,033 --> 00:21:35,5
and we can't do anything on the case
until tomorrow,

480
00:21:35,062 --> 00:21:37,4
so our night's free.

481
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,7
Go on.

482
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:41,6
Well, I thought
that maybe we could meet up later.

483
00:21:42,042 --> 00:21:43,4
And, er...

484
00:21:43,084 --> 00:21:45,9
You know, not exactly a date, but...

485
00:21:46,093 --> 00:21:47,8
maybe something better.

486
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:51,1
Well, it sounds like you have something
very particular in mind.

487
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:02,1
See you next week.

488
00:22:05,007 --> 00:22:06,0
Amenadiel.

489
00:22:06,053 --> 00:22:07,4
What are you doing here?

490
00:22:07,074 --> 00:22:09,0
I brought you some things.

491
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:12,4
Stuff that could help you out
during this time.

492
00:22:13,012 --> 00:22:16,7
That's so nice of you,
but I don't need anything.

493
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:19,5
Linda, listen, I want to be here for you,
alright?

494
00:22:20,017 --> 00:22:23,2
So I figured that this would be
a good way for us to start.

495
00:22:25,071 --> 00:22:26,5
Now...

496
00:22:28,001 --> 00:22:29,0
let's do this.

497
00:22:30,001 --> 00:22:32,2
This one's good, because this Dr. Spock...

498
00:22:32,068 --> 00:22:34,6
he seems to know the most about babies.

499
00:22:35,035 --> 00:22:37,2
This one shows the baby

500
00:22:37,035 --> 00:22:39,3
that all animals poop.

501
00:22:41,044 --> 00:22:44,7
I'm not really sure
why the baby would need to know that.

502
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:47,3
This one is good...

503
00:22:47,078 --> 00:22:50,2
because it tells you what to do
when a baby is crying.

504
00:22:50,074 --> 00:22:52,2
Although maybe you don't need this one.

505
00:22:52,032 --> 00:22:54,7
I overheard at least three people
crying in here today

506
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:57,4
-and you handled it like a pro--
-It's too soon.

507
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:01,0
Honestly.

508
00:23:01,092 --> 00:23:05,9
It's very kind of you and I appreciate
the gesture, I really do...

509
00:23:07,017 --> 00:23:08,0
but I...

510
00:23:10,005 --> 00:23:12,7
I told you you were the father
because you deserved to know.

511
00:23:14,001 --> 00:23:16,2
Not to pressure you into helping out.

512
00:23:16,056 --> 00:23:18,6
The truth is
I'm used to doing things on my own.

513
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:22,3
I don't see why raising a baby
should be any different.

514
00:23:23,061 --> 00:23:24,6
I just wanted to help.

515
00:23:24,094 --> 00:23:26,2
You don't need to worry about me.

516
00:23:28,082 --> 00:23:29,9
And you, I...

517
00:23:30,065 --> 00:23:31,7
I would love to talk, but,

518
00:23:31,086 --> 00:23:35,1
unfortunately, I have a ton of paperwork
to do before my next client, so...

519
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:36,2
Right.

520
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,3
I'll get out of your way.

521
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,0
I like that one.

522
00:23:49,034 --> 00:23:51,2
[Maze]
Really? Not the one I would have chosen,

523
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,3
but you are the closest person to a baby
I know.

524
00:23:54,043 --> 00:23:57,0
Okay, so at what age did your parents
teach you to hunt?

525
00:23:57,014 --> 00:24:00,0
[Dan] What's going on? Maze, you know
she's not allowed to play with knives.

526
00:24:00,014 --> 00:24:03,1
Relax, Dan,
these knives aren't for Trixie.

527
00:24:04,031 --> 00:24:05,2
They're for a baby.

528
00:24:07,065 --> 00:24:08,5
Okay, new rule.

529
00:24:09,015 --> 00:24:12,6
No more knife play of any kind
with my kid. You got it?

530
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:14,9
-Fine.
-Trixie, it's time to go.

531
00:24:15,028 --> 00:24:16,1
Grab your stuff.

532
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:18,8
So who pissed in your Cheerios?

533
00:24:18,095 --> 00:24:20,7
You're even grumpier than usual.

534
00:24:21,037 --> 00:24:24,0
It's the case, okay? I feel powerless.

535
00:24:24,017 --> 00:24:26,3
Any second now,
another person could get killed

536
00:24:26,042 --> 00:24:28,8
and we're just...
we're sitting on our asses.

537
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,3
-Why?
-Because we've got to wait for a judge

538
00:24:31,047 --> 00:24:32,8
to give us a stupid warrant.

539
00:24:36,034 --> 00:24:37,5
Says who?

540
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,7
Mr. Morningstar,
thank you for reaching out.

541
00:24:51,003 --> 00:24:51,9
Are you okay?

542
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:55,0
Did Detective Decker...
Did she do something?

543
00:24:55,011 --> 00:24:55,9
No.

544
00:24:56,057 --> 00:24:57,4
And she never will.

545
00:24:57,062 --> 00:25:00,3
I'm just here to tell you
that you're wrong about the Detective.

546
00:25:00,091 --> 00:25:02,8
If she's planning anything,
it's an apology.

547
00:25:03,091 --> 00:25:06,1
I certainly hope that that's the case.

548
00:25:06,025 --> 00:25:08,7
Oh, ye of little faith, Father.

549
00:25:10,096 --> 00:25:12,7
Have you noticed her carrying a vial?

550
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:15,4
A what?

551
00:25:15,093 --> 00:25:17,6
[Father] A vial. It's a...

552
00:25:17,093 --> 00:25:20,3
An ornate thing.
It's about the size of a plum.

553
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,4
I got word from a colleague of mine
in Rome that she'd met with a priest

554
00:25:24,056 --> 00:25:27,6
who was hell-bent
on banishing the devil from Earth.

555
00:25:28,052 --> 00:25:31,3
And you all get paid to do this?
I'm genuinely asking.

556
00:25:32,003 --> 00:25:35,7
Supposedly, this priest has uncovered
a ceremony that would, and bear with me...

557
00:25:36,045 --> 00:25:39,1
trap the devil in hell for all eternity.

558
00:25:39,062 --> 00:25:42,7
He shared the details of this ceremony
with Chloe.

559
00:25:43,058 --> 00:25:44,5
[giggles]

560
00:25:45,016 --> 00:25:49,4
A ceremony to banish the devil to hell?
That is priceless. Ha-ha!

561
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:50,3
No, seriously,

562
00:25:50,046 --> 00:25:54,1
you all need to take  End of Days
out of the Vatican movie night rotation.

563
00:25:55,022 --> 00:25:56,7
Definitely not one of Arnold's best.

564
00:25:56,084 --> 00:25:57,6
I know.

565
00:25:57,076 --> 00:25:59,1
I know it sounds crazy.

566
00:25:59,076 --> 00:26:03,1
But Chloe was very distressed
last time I saw her.

567
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:07,7
Apparently, the ceremony involves
giving the subject a sacramental liquid...

568
00:26:08,023 --> 00:26:09,6
that would sedate the devil.

569
00:26:10,044 --> 00:26:11,9
Ooh, let me guess.

570
00:26:12,007 --> 00:26:13,6
It's inside the plum vial.

571
00:26:14,007 --> 00:26:15,0
So I'm told.

572
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,9
And if it would sedate the devil,
I fear that it involves some poison.

573
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:21,9
Something that would kill a normal man.

574
00:26:22,024 --> 00:26:23,9
You're incorrigible, aren't you?

575
00:26:24,004 --> 00:26:26,7
Do you honestly think
that I would travel thousands of miles,

576
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:30,0
tell you these outlandish tales,
if I didn't take them seriously?

577
00:26:31,021 --> 00:26:33,1
I hope beyond hope that I am wrong.

578
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:36,6
But if there is any chance
that Chloe could try something,

579
00:26:37,005 --> 00:26:38,6
you need to be careful.

580
00:26:39,026 --> 00:26:41,6
Well, consider me warned.

581
00:26:42,014 --> 00:26:45,5
You may absolve yourself of any further
responsibility in this matter.

582
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,1
Now, if you'll excuse me...

583
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:48,8
I have plans.

584
00:26:56,007 --> 00:26:56,9
[door rattles]

585
00:26:58,045 --> 00:26:59,6
Is that the man?

586
00:27:00,028 --> 00:27:01,7
Not a man, Your Excellency.

587
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:04,3
The prophecy is real.

588
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:07,4
And now that the trap is set...

589
00:27:09,004 --> 00:27:10,7
everything will come together soon.

590
00:27:20,026 --> 00:27:24,2
I hope this so-called surprise of yours
doesn't involve me taking off my shoes.

591
00:27:25,001 --> 00:27:27,8
I should warn you
that what I have planned...

592
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,2
might be painful for you, but...

593
00:27:30,077 --> 00:27:33,3
I think, ultimately,
you'll see it's a good thing.

594
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,4
Painful?

595
00:27:34,056 --> 00:27:36,6
Detective,
what on Earth are you talking about?

596
00:27:36,069 --> 00:27:38,2
It's just up ahead.

597
00:27:39,003 --> 00:27:39,9
What is?

598
00:27:42,091 --> 00:27:44,7
Just... forgive me.

599
00:27:46,087 --> 00:27:47,7
Detective...

600
00:27:49,004 --> 00:27:50,2
where are you taking me?

601
00:27:52,062 --> 00:27:54,0
[banging on metal]

602
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:58,4
[menacing rap playing in background]

603
00:27:58,076 --> 00:27:59,7
Howdy.

604
00:28:01,063 --> 00:28:03,1
What's up, fellas?

605
00:28:04,014 --> 00:28:05,3
[door bangs shut]

606
00:28:07,068 --> 00:28:09,3
Do you have any idea where you are?

607
00:28:10,014 --> 00:28:11,1
Yes, I do.

608
00:28:11,085 --> 00:28:12,9
Los Xs headquarters.

609
00:28:13,048 --> 00:28:16,1
So-called brain trust
of your transnational drug operation.

610
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,7
[Dan laughs] Come on, guys, relax.

611
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,6
That's not why I'm here, okay?

612
00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:22,9
Susan Ochoa and David Ramirez
were murdered.

613
00:28:23,045 --> 00:28:26,4
And I know you guys are involved somehow.

614
00:28:26,099 --> 00:28:29,7
So I need to talk to the guy or the girl
who's in charge.

615
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:32,7
And be quick about it.
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

616
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:34,7
[chuckles]

617
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:37,0
Okay, you know what,
maybe I didn't make myself clear.

618
00:28:38,013 --> 00:28:41,3
Which one of you losers is in charge?

619
00:28:43,068 --> 00:28:45,3
Okay. Alright.

620
00:28:45,097 --> 00:28:48,3
I guess I'm just going to have
to press the issue, right?

622
00:28:50,047 --> 00:28:52,3
-[Dan] Come on!
-[someone whistles]

623
00:28:54,031 --> 00:28:56,2
You see now, that wasn't so hard, was it?

624
00:28:58,006 --> 00:29:01,7
[Dan] What's up? Can you please tell me
everything you know about the murders?

625
00:29:02,015 --> 00:29:02,9
What if I don't?

626
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:04,8
Well, then there's going to be a problem.

627
00:29:05,024 --> 00:29:06,8
[laughs wheezily]

628
00:29:08,062 --> 00:29:12,8
Ah, you're a crazy pig, aren't you?
Respeto.

629
00:29:13,091 --> 00:29:15,4
But the only problem we got...

630
00:29:16,012 --> 00:29:18,8
is figuring out
what we're going to do with your body.

631
00:29:18,092 --> 00:29:20,6
Ssss!  Matalo!

632

[groaning]

638
00:29:45,061 --> 00:29:47,3
Cut it a little close there,
don't you think?

639
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:49,0
My timing is perfect.

640
00:29:58,071 --> 00:29:59,6

643
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,2
[men] Let's go.

644
00:30:25,044 --> 00:30:27,5
What are we doing in a soup kitchen?

645
00:30:27,082 --> 00:30:30,4
Volunteering.
You should try it. It could be fun.

646
00:30:30,074 --> 00:30:33,4
Watching people trip and fall is fun.
This...

647
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:35,2
not fun.

648
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:40,1
Lucifer, I just thought it would be nice
for us to do something good for a change.

649
00:30:40,021 --> 00:30:44,2
Oh, for a change. And just what exactly
is it you'd like me to change?

650
00:30:44,034 --> 00:30:46,1
Oh, Lucifer, that's not what I meant.

651
00:30:46,067 --> 00:30:49,0
Listen, okay, if you'd like to leave,
we can leave.

652
00:30:52,085 --> 00:30:55,5
You have been acting very strange,
Detective.

653
00:30:55,097 --> 00:30:58,8
Wanting me to drink less,
be nicer to suspects, be more...

654
00:30:58,094 --> 00:31:00,5
-[phone buzzes]
-...more philanthropic.

655
00:31:00,065 --> 00:31:02,1
Oh, that's not true.

656
00:31:02,056 --> 00:31:04,9
The only thing that's true
is that you've been lying to me.

657
00:31:05,032 --> 00:31:06,4
No, I haven't.

658
00:31:06,094 --> 00:31:07,8
Show me your purse.

659
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,7
My purse?

660
00:31:09,024 --> 00:31:10,7
-Why?
-Show it to me.

661
00:31:10,086 --> 00:31:11,7
Okay.

662
00:31:12,057 --> 00:31:13,7
Fine.

663
00:31:21,067 --> 00:31:22,8
Detective, what's this?

664
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,3
Nothing.

665
00:31:25,042 --> 00:31:28,3
Oh, right. Well, if it's nothing,
you won't mind me drinking it, will you?

666
00:31:28,046 --> 00:31:30,8
-No, don't drink it. It's perfume.
-I've had worse.

667
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:32,5
[Chloe yells] No, don't!

668
00:31:34,051 --> 00:31:36,8
I know you've been meeting
with Father Kinley.

669
00:31:38,022 --> 00:31:39,4
I know all about it.

670
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:41,9
-It's not what you think.
-Isn't it?

671
00:31:42,002 --> 00:31:45,4
-[phone buzzes]
-No, it's not. It's...

672
00:31:45,048 --> 00:31:47,1
[Chloe gasps]

673
00:31:48,015 --> 00:31:51,0
Dan, can I call you back?
I'm right in the middle of something.

674
00:31:51,011 --> 00:31:52,5
[Dan]  I know who the killer is.

675
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:53,6
[Chloe]  What?

676
00:31:53,082 --> 00:31:55,2
And he's about to skip town.

677
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:17,8
[phone buzzes]

678
00:32:17,093 --> 00:32:18,8
[Chloe] Hey, Dan.

679
00:32:18,093 --> 00:32:21,5
[Dan]  Okay, his name is Oscar
and I just sent you a picture.

680
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:26,8
[Chloe] It's Susan Ochoa's drug counselor.
We talked to him at the scene.

681
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:29,1
Well, the head of Los Xs
says that he's the killer.

682
00:32:29,028 --> 00:32:30,5
The head of Los Xs?

683
00:32:31,007 --> 00:32:32,0
How?

684
00:32:32,015 --> 00:32:33,9
We caught a break, okay?
It doesn't matter.

685
00:32:33,099 --> 00:32:36,8
What matters is that Rivas
was a gang counselor for both victims.

686
00:32:36,095 --> 00:32:38,4
So you're saying they trusted him,

687
00:32:38,053 --> 00:32:42,3
made their dark sides vulnerable
and then he just stabbed them in the back.

688
00:32:42,046 --> 00:32:43,6
Yeah, pretty much.

689
00:32:44,033 --> 00:32:45,2
Why?

690
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:46,9
That's the million-dollar question.

Careful, or I'll show you the real me.

Oh, yes. Do it!

713
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:52,4
I thought they could change.

714
00:33:53,028 --> 00:33:54,3
But they couldn't.

715
00:33:55,011 --> 00:33:56,6
Dave was stealing again.

716
00:33:57,007 --> 00:33:58,7
Susan was back on drugs.

717
00:33:58,099 --> 00:33:59,9
They were trash.

00:34:00,062 --> 00:34:01,6

00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:20,9
[Oscar panting]

729
00:34:21,047 --> 00:34:22,7
Do you want me to punish you?

730
00:34:24,027 --> 00:34:25,6
-Why?
-[Chloe] Hands in the air.

731
00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:30,6
I failed.

732
00:34:32,057 --> 00:34:33,7
May God forgive me.

733
00:34:35,007 --> 00:34:36,8
-[groans]
-[splintering sound]

734
00:34:39,041 --> 00:34:41,3
[Dan]
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about, man.

735
00:34:41,041 --> 00:34:44,7
When you kneed that dude
and he fell down and I just came in there,

736
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,1
wham, elbow to the face, amazing.

737
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,8
It just felt so good, you know.

738
00:34:49,096 --> 00:34:52,8
Just to let loose,
not have to follow the rules for a change.

739
00:34:53,034 --> 00:34:55,8
And you are amazing...

740
00:34:56,042 --> 00:34:57,5
for helping me out like that.

741
00:34:57,076 --> 00:34:59,5
Come on, any time
you want to beat someone up.

742
00:34:59,068 --> 00:35:01,7
Any time, you call me.

743
00:35:01,084 --> 00:35:04,1
In fact, I'm going to kick your ass
if you don't.

744
00:35:04,026 --> 00:35:06,1
Oh, man, this is going to sound crazy.

745
00:35:06,093 --> 00:35:08,3
But I can't wait to do it again.

746
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:11,5
Oh! Old Dan is back.

747
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,4
I am so in.

748
00:35:13,056 --> 00:35:15,6
The straight and narrow Dan,
total buzzkill.

749
00:35:16,028 --> 00:35:17,6
Screw that Dan.

750
00:35:18,036 --> 00:35:19,6
It was getting me nowhere.

751
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:21,7
Trust me, darker Dan...

752
00:35:22,032 --> 00:35:23,5
will get you real far.

753
00:35:28,054 --> 00:35:30,3
Well, that does it.

754
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,5
I'll never be able to eat beef kebabs
ever again.

755
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,9
Did you find anything?

756
00:35:38,038 --> 00:35:42,3
[Ella] Yeah, same thing. Bloody clothes,
another knife, same as the others.

757
00:35:42,047 --> 00:35:43,6
And who owns the house?

758
00:35:43,072 --> 00:35:46,3
I don't know, 
I'll see if we have that yet. Man...

759
00:35:46,072 --> 00:35:49,7
this dude must have been really
scared of something to go out like that.

760
00:35:50,035 --> 00:35:52,2
[Chloe] Mm. Or someone.

761
00:35:57,094 --> 00:35:58,8
Are you okay?

762
00:35:59,069 --> 00:36:01,2
Something else was happening here.

763
00:36:02,011 --> 00:36:03,1
Something strange.

764
00:36:05,012 --> 00:36:08,6
He knew about my true face.
He wanted me to show it to him.

765
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,4
-Why?
-I don't know.

766
00:36:11,016 --> 00:36:16,0
But I could have sworn
that he said, "Show us your face."

767
00:36:16,017 --> 00:36:17,0
[Chloe] Us?

768
00:36:17,017 --> 00:36:18,5
But there was no-one else here.

769
00:36:22,026 --> 00:36:23,9
Unless it's a two-way mirror.

770
00:36:24,022 --> 00:36:26,6
[splintering of glass]

771
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:34,1
[Ella] Erm, that was evidence.
This is a secure crime scene.

772
00:36:35,035 --> 00:36:36,3
Never mind.

773
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,3
You're never going to believe
who owns the house.

774
00:36:41,024 --> 00:36:42,5
The Catholic Church.

775
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,3
Your friend Father Kinley
must have been watching.

776
00:36:47,083 --> 00:36:50,4
I think Kinley arranged all of this
to get to you.

777
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:53,6
He wanted to show someone who...

778
00:36:54,042 --> 00:36:55,2
or what...

779
00:36:56,033 --> 00:36:57,7
you really are.

780
00:36:58,017 --> 00:37:01,3
I know that we have a lot to talk about
and I have a lot to explain

781
00:37:01,038 --> 00:37:04,2
and I know a lot of this is my fault,
but you need to trust me right now.

782
00:37:04,034 --> 00:37:06,3
Oh! Really?

783
00:37:06,047 --> 00:37:09,0
-I think you're in real danger.
-Enlighten me, Detective.

784
00:37:10,006 --> 00:37:12,2
Just who exactly am I in danger from?

785
00:37:16,065 --> 00:37:18,6
What in God's name was that?

786
00:37:19,032 --> 00:37:20,5
It was a setback, that's all.

787
00:37:21,003 --> 00:37:24,3
That man killed two people,
then himself, and you knew?

788
00:37:24,045 --> 00:37:27,1
No, wait. You orchestrated it.

789
00:37:28,057 --> 00:37:30,0
Extreme measures were taken.

790
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,6
It would have been worth it
if Lucifer had shown his true face.

791
00:37:33,091 --> 00:37:35,4
Can you even hear yourself?

792
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:39,7
The Church needs to see that
Lucifer Morningstar is the actual devil.

793
00:37:39,088 --> 00:37:41,2
[distant footsteps]

794
00:37:41,034 --> 00:37:42,3
It should have worked.

795
00:37:43,005 --> 00:37:45,4
Chloe told me that he likes to make
every case about himself

796
00:37:45,055 --> 00:37:48,6
and I set it up perfectly
for him to want to punish Rivas.

797
00:37:49,064 --> 00:37:51,0
How could he not reveal himself?

798
00:37:51,056 --> 00:37:53,8
[Chloe] Because he's better
than you give him credit for.

799
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:55,0
[laughs]

800
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:56,2
Detective Decker.

801
00:37:56,089 --> 00:37:59,6
Well, she knows the truth. Tell him.

802
00:38:00,019 --> 00:38:01,6
I do know the truth, Father.

803
00:38:02,032 --> 00:38:05,4
You worked at the same parish
in El Salvador as Oscar Rivas.

804
00:38:06,045 --> 00:38:07,8
It's quite the coincidence.

805
00:38:08,011 --> 00:38:12,1
Oscar was a good man, a true believer,
willing to do what was necessary.

806
00:38:13,037 --> 00:38:16,0
To take what action was needed
to battle evil.

807
00:38:16,054 --> 00:38:20,2
You had Rivas kill two innocent people
to battle evil?

808
00:38:21,013 --> 00:38:23,3
He willingly sacrificed himself

809
00:38:23,038 --> 00:38:28,3
to force Lucifer to reveal his true form,
to show the Church finally the truth.

810
00:38:29,005 --> 00:38:30,2
[Father scoffs]

811
00:38:31,014 --> 00:38:33,8
This is all your own private crusade,
isn't it, Father?

812
00:38:33,093 --> 00:38:35,7
The Vatican doesn't know about this,
do they?

813
00:38:36,002 --> 00:38:36,8
[laughs]

814
00:38:38,023 --> 00:38:39,9
Because they don't believe.

815
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:43,7
But, together,
you and I can convince them.

816
00:38:44,098 --> 00:38:46,4
Together, we can save them.

817
00:38:47,003 --> 00:38:48,1
And so many others.

818
00:38:48,061 --> 00:38:50,0
[clink of handcuffs]

819
00:38:50,016 --> 00:38:51,2
You're under arrest, Father.

820
00:38:52,012 --> 00:38:53,5
For conspiracy to commit murder.

821
00:38:54,024 --> 00:38:55,4
Dear, dear girl...

822
00:38:56,004 --> 00:38:59,1
Oscar is dead
and I have done nothing wrong myself.

823
00:38:59,025 --> 00:39:00,2
You have no proof.

824
00:39:00,092 --> 00:39:02,3
It's your word against mine.

825
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:05,5
-[handcuffs clink]
-There is always evidence.

826
00:39:06,013 --> 00:39:09,7
I will find it and I won't stop
until there's enough to put you away.

827
00:39:09,093 --> 00:39:11,1
[Vicar] That won't be necessary.

828
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:14,1
I'll testify. Anything you need.

829
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:20,3
I'm sorry, but you're sick, Will.

830
00:39:28,036 --> 00:39:29,5
[female voice] Mrs. Smith.

831
00:39:30,045 --> 00:39:32,0
I'm looking for Mrs. Smith.

832
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,0
Amenadiel.

833
00:39:41,025 --> 00:39:42,5
What are you doing here?

834
00:39:42,058 --> 00:39:44,2
Linda, you don't have to do this alone.

835
00:39:45,013 --> 00:39:48,5
I want to be here for this baby and, most
importantly, I want to be here for you.

836
00:39:50,063 --> 00:39:51,8
Erm...

837
00:39:52,047 --> 00:39:53,6
Yeah.

838
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:57,0
[Linda] Oh.

839
00:40:03,073 --> 00:40:05,1
Will you marry me?

840
00:40:05,019 --> 00:40:06,1
[surprised giggles]

841
00:40:06,044 --> 00:40:07,6
[laughs]

842
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,5
[Linda inhales, whispers] No.

843
00:40:10,061 --> 00:40:12,1
[woman gasps in background]

844
00:40:13,053 --> 00:40:15,4
[quietly] No.

845
00:40:16,083 --> 00:40:17,9
No. Amenadiel...

846
00:40:18,024 --> 00:40:19,2
Amenadiel, come here.

847
00:40:19,095 --> 00:40:20,9
See...

848
00:40:21,004 --> 00:40:22,1
Amenadiel...

849
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:29,2
What you're doing is amazing
and heroic and I should be so lucky...

850
00:40:29,092 --> 00:40:32,9
to end up with someone
half as special as you are.

851
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:36,3
But what you're doing here, it's...

852
00:40:39,064 --> 00:40:41,5
It's for the wrong reasons.

853
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:44,1
And it's...

854
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:46,1
It's not what I...

855
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,1
It's not what I need right now.

856
00:40:49,044 --> 00:40:50,5
And what do you need?

857
00:40:54,003 --> 00:40:56,0
I think I just need someone
to hold my hand

858
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:58,2
and tell me everything's going to be okay.

859
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,3
I promise you, Linda...

860
00:41:07,059 --> 00:41:09,1
everything is going to be okay.

861
00:41:10,046 --> 00:41:11,3
[sighs]

862
00:41:23,006 --> 00:41:24,2
[bell rings]

863
00:41:29,032 --> 00:41:30,1
Hi.

864
00:41:35,049 --> 00:41:37,3
I arrested Father Kinley,

865
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:40,0
so you don't have to worry about him
coming after you anymore.

866
00:41:42,024 --> 00:41:44,4
I don't care
that he was trying to hurt me.

867
00:41:46,021 --> 00:41:47,2
I care that you were.

868
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:50,3
[sighs]

869
00:41:50,071 --> 00:41:52,9
Lucifer, you have to understand that...

870
00:41:54,026 --> 00:41:55,8
after I saw you...

871
00:41:57,084 --> 00:41:58,8
saw your face...

872
00:42:00,064 --> 00:42:02,2
I had to get away...

873
00:42:02,085 --> 00:42:04,2
to process things...

874
00:42:04,093 --> 00:42:05,7
you know?

875
00:42:07,006 --> 00:42:10,4
And somehow I ended up in Rome.

876
00:42:11,082 --> 00:42:12,8
Kinley found me...

877
00:42:13,053 --> 00:42:16,7
and obviously
I shouldn't have confided in him, but...

878
00:42:17,036 --> 00:42:19,2
[sighs] you know, at the time...

879
00:42:19,082 --> 00:42:22,0
it felt like he understood
what I was going through.

880
00:42:22,033 --> 00:42:24,5
-He said you found him.
-He's lying.

881
00:42:29,012 --> 00:42:30,8
There's a lot of that going around.

882
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:32,7
Well, yes...

883
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,3
I...

884
00:42:35,088 --> 00:42:38,0
[voice wavers] I did lie to you...

885
00:42:38,043 --> 00:42:43,2
and for a moment, I was helping him
try to send you back to hell.

886
00:42:43,072 --> 00:42:44,5
[scoffs]

887
00:42:45,064 --> 00:42:47,8
How could you do that to me? To me?

888
00:42:47,089 --> 00:42:49,8
[screaming] Because I'm terrified!

889
00:42:53,036 --> 00:42:54,4
[gasps]

890
00:42:54,053 --> 00:42:55,9
You are the...

891
00:42:56,061 --> 00:42:58,4
actual devil.

892
00:42:58,053 --> 00:42:59,4
I mean...

893
00:43:02,058 --> 00:43:09,3
every story of good and bad
from throughout history, throughout time,

894
00:43:09,046 --> 00:43:13,9
says that you are the embodiment of evil.

895
00:43:14,059 --> 00:43:16,5
[Chloe gasps, sobbing]

896
00:43:16,063 --> 00:43:20,3
And how am I, Chloe Decker, a nobody...

897
00:43:21,018 --> 00:43:22,8
supposed to deal with that?

898
00:43:32,081 --> 00:43:33,8
But...

899
00:43:34,073 --> 00:43:35,6
But then...

900
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:39,8
Then I came back.

901
00:43:41,095 --> 00:43:42,7
And...

902
00:43:43,057 --> 00:43:44,6
[sighs]

903
00:43:45,041 --> 00:43:46,4
And I saw you.

904
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:49,7
I really saw you.

905
00:43:52,075 --> 00:43:54,7
And I remembered how you made me feel.

906
00:43:57,013 --> 00:43:59,9
And I realized, Lucifer,
you're not that guy.

907
00:44:00,067 --> 00:44:01,5
No.

908
00:44:03,076 --> 00:44:05,4
What if I am that guy?

909
00:44:06,051 --> 00:44:09,1
You don't have to be. You could change.

910
00:44:09,027 --> 00:44:10,6
But what if I can't?

911
00:44:13,069 --> 00:44:14,8
[gasps]

912
00:44:16,032 --> 00:44:18,0
Could you accept me like this?

913
00:44:20,015 --> 00:44:21,9
I... oh...

914
00:44:22,057 --> 00:44:26,4
You have no idea how much I want to.

915
00:44:27,003 --> 00:44:28,7
I do. I'm...

916
00:44:29,024 --> 00:44:30,0
I'm trying.

917
00:44:30,016 --> 00:44:31,1
But could you?

918
00:44:31,091 --> 00:44:36,7
[sniffs, stammers, sobs]

919
00:44:37,013 --> 00:44:38,3
I don't know.

920
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,4
[sniffs]

921
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,0
Then I have my answer.

922
00:44:48,076 --> 00:44:49,6
[gasps]

923
00:45:13,058 --> 00:45:16,5
[inaudible]

924
00:45:28,093 --> 00:45:29,8
Your Excellency.

925
00:45:30,064 --> 00:45:32,8
Did you change your mind?
Are you here to get me out?

926
00:45:33,048 --> 00:45:35,0
I am here to take your confession.

927
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,9
I have nothing to confess.

928
00:45:37,098 --> 00:45:41,9
William, you are responsible
for the deaths of three people. For what?

929
00:45:42,003 --> 00:45:43,9
I'm trying to save lives.

930
00:45:44,049 --> 00:45:45,9
To stop the prophecy.

931
00:45:46,082 --> 00:45:50,9
When the devil walks the earth and finds
his first love, evil shall be released.

932
00:45:51,003 --> 00:45:53,7
Enough with this damned prophecy
you're obsessed with.

933
00:45:53,087 --> 00:45:55,9
The devil is walking the earth.

934
00:45:56,004 --> 00:45:57,7
His Holiness has issued an order.

935
00:45:58,075 --> 00:46:00,1
You've been excommunicated.

936
00:46:04,055 --> 00:46:05,4
I...

937
00:46:05,092 --> 00:46:10,7
may have failed, temporarily,
to prove that Lucifer is the devil,

938
00:46:11,014 --> 00:46:13,7
but at least I have pushed him
and Chloe Decker apart.

939
00:46:13,085 --> 00:46:16,3
Maybe that will be enough
to stop the prophecy.

940
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:22,4
Even if Lucifer Morningstar was the devil

941
00:46:22,069 --> 00:46:24,4
and the prophecy was true...

942
00:46:25,061 --> 00:46:28,9
what makes you so sure
Chloe Decker is even his first love?

943
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:39,7
I'll be praying for you, William.

944
00:46:46,022 --> 00:46:47,3
[door buzzes]

945
00:46:47,038 --> 00:46:48,2
Of course she is.

946
00:46:49,051 --> 00:46:50,7
Who else could it be?

947
00:46:50,084 --> 00:46:55,0
["Glory Box" by Portishead
playing in background]

948
00:47:04,027 --> 00:47:05,5
[sighs]

949
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:08,5
So many options.

950
00:47:13,033 --> 00:47:14,2
I'll have...

951
00:47:16,054 --> 00:47:17,5
an appletini.
