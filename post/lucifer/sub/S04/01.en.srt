it's not a question of when...

something I bear no responsibility.

the satisfaction, but...

I stopped coming to crime scenes.

without helping at all?

Yes. I've been holding on
to a false hope, it seems.

that one day she'd just...

It looks like one of the hives
was attacked.

So maybe Bob caught the killer
stomping on his poor bees and they fought?

180

Possibly. Any witnesses?

187
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:15,3
[Lenore sniffles]
No one hated Bob. He was a gentle soul.

188
00:09:15,063 --> 00:09:17,3
He never even raised his voice.

189
00:09:17,068 --> 00:09:20,1
And you can't think of anybody
who may have wanted to hurt him?

190
00:09:20,051 --> 00:09:21,3
I can't.

191
00:09:22,018 --> 00:09:23,0
I mean, we...

192
00:09:23,072 --> 00:09:25,6
We sell honey
at the farmers' market together.

193
00:09:25,073 --> 00:09:27,7
It's just one big family over there.

194
00:09:28,065 --> 00:09:29,9
[Chloe] All right...

195
00:09:30,015 --> 00:09:32,1
I'm... right in the middle of something.

196
00:09:32,098 --> 00:09:34,2
So, go on.

197
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:36,0
[Lenore] I, um...

198
00:09:37,095 --> 00:09:39,4
I can't imagine...

199
00:09:41,099 --> 00:09:43,3
I'm so sorry, excuse me.

200
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,0
Could I speak with you?

201
00:09:50,017 --> 00:09:52,4
Lucifer, her husband was just murdered.

202
00:09:52,075 --> 00:09:53,6
Are you...

203
00:09:54,092 --> 00:09:55,9
okay?

204
00:09:57,026 --> 00:09:58,3
Yeah, I'm fine.

205
00:09:58,072 --> 00:09:59,5
Where did you go?

206
00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:03,6
Oh, uh, I took Trixie to Europe
and we traveled around and...

207
00:10:04,018 --> 00:10:05,8
you know, it gave me time to...

208
00:10:06,027 --> 00:10:08,2
to process what I saw.

209
00:10:08,073 --> 00:10:09,7
And...

210
00:10:09,094 --> 00:10:11,4
have you processed?

211
00:10:12,023 --> 00:10:13,1
Are-- Are you...

212
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,4
okay with what you saw?

213
00:10:15,086 --> 00:10:17,0
-I--
-Detective...

214
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,4
are you okay with me?

215
00:10:20,003 --> 00:10:22,7
It's not like you haven't always
told me the truth.

216
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,2
You know?

217
00:10:25,004 --> 00:10:25,8
So...

218
00:10:26,054 --> 00:10:28,0
I think, deep down, I just...

219
00:10:28,066 --> 00:10:29,9
I always knew.

220
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,4
But how does it make you feel?

221
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,8
Afraid? Terrified?
Do you want to yell at me?

222
00:10:33,096 --> 00:10:36,2
Punch me in the face? Run away again?

223
00:10:36,076 --> 00:10:37,6
[Chloe] I...

224
00:10:38,001 --> 00:10:39,8
I think I just want to get back to work.

225
00:10:40,038 --> 00:10:41,2
That's all?

226
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:42,9
That's all.

227
00:10:50,065 --> 00:10:52,1
What the f...

228
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:54,2
[theme music playing]

229
00:11:02,057 --> 00:11:05,1
I'm glad I've come to talk to you
all these years, Linda.

230
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:09,3
You've opened my eyes,
helped me understand how emotions work.

231
00:11:09,062 --> 00:11:11,4
Thank you, Lucifer. That's...

232
00:11:12,008 --> 00:11:13,2
wonderful to hear.

233
00:11:14,025 --> 00:11:18,0
Once again, your insight
has helped me come to a realization.

234
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,8
The Detective is clearly in denial.

235
00:11:21,088 --> 00:11:22,8
Ah.

236
00:11:24,005 --> 00:11:24,8
Of course.

237
00:11:24,097 --> 00:11:28,9
How else to explain
her complete non-reaction to my true self?

238
00:11:29,002 --> 00:11:30,4
Help me, Doctor.

239
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,1
Help me help her.

240
00:11:32,077 --> 00:11:36,8
-Well, what did you want to hear from her?
-What I want isn't important.

241
00:11:36,094 --> 00:11:37,9
I disagree.

242
00:11:38,061 --> 00:11:40,4
What Chloe is going through is...

243
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:44,7
incredibly difficult.

244
00:11:45,003 --> 00:11:46,9
Trust me, I know from experience.

245
00:11:47,087 --> 00:11:49,6
But I'm your therapist.

246
00:11:50,054 --> 00:11:51,5
Not hers.

247
00:11:52,016 --> 00:11:55,2
And I wonder if whether you expected

248
00:11:55,075 --> 00:11:57,2
her to reject you.

249
00:11:58,034 --> 00:11:59,8
Maybe even wanted her to.

250
00:12:00,013 --> 00:12:02,0
Well, why on earth
would I want her to reject me?

251
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:05,6
Because your Devil face has returned
and you've refused to talk about it.

252
00:12:05,072 --> 00:12:07,4
[sighs, scoffs]

253
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:11,1
There's not much to say, really.

254
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:14,0
I killed a human for the first time,
my Devil face returned.

255
00:12:14,015 --> 00:12:16,4
I don't think it's as simple as that.

256
00:12:16,065 --> 00:12:19,6
Killing a human is against
your father's rules, not your own.

257
00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:23,1
And you've recently learned
that angels self-actualize.

258
00:12:23,045 --> 00:12:24,4
So you think...

259
00:12:24,066 --> 00:12:27,0
that I'm punishing myself
for killing a human?

260
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:28,7
I'm wondering if...

261
00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:31,5
you're punishing yourself for enjoying it.

262
00:12:33,075 --> 00:12:34,5
[Lucifer scoffs]

263
00:12:36,013 --> 00:12:37,3
So what if I did?

264
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:41,5
Then perhaps that's why you see yourself
as evil again.

265
00:12:42,063 --> 00:12:45,7
And perhaps that's why
you want Chloe to reject you.

266
00:12:45,084 --> 00:12:47,4
I don't want her to reject me.

267
00:12:47,068 --> 00:12:49,6
She told you she's fine.

268
00:12:51,014 --> 00:12:52,9
What if what she told you is...

269
00:12:53,052 --> 00:12:55,7
actually simply the truth?

270
00:12:55,098 --> 00:12:57,3
And what if it isn't?

271
00:12:58,048 --> 00:13:00,0
She'll find a way to let you know.

272
00:13:00,061 --> 00:13:03,9
So you're saying I should just act
as if everything is as she claims...

273
00:13:05,003 --> 00:13:08,2
then slowly poke at her denial
and find a way to pop the bubble.

274
00:13:09,099 --> 00:13:14,2
I know nothing I can say
is going to stop you from doing that.

275
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:16,1
But all I can ask is...

276
00:13:17,033 --> 00:13:18,6
Take it slowly.

277
00:13:19,004 --> 00:13:21,3
[laughing] Of course, Doctor.

278
00:13:22,063 --> 00:13:23,7
Baby steps.

279
00:13:25,051 --> 00:13:26,4
I'm the Devil.

280
00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:29,3
[Chloe] Lucifer, what are you doing?

281
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,1
Detective, it's time Miss Lopez
finally knew the truth.

282
00:13:32,043 --> 00:13:36,3
[Lucifer] I am the angel who led
a rebellion against my father, God.

283
00:13:37,035 --> 00:13:38,7
I was banished to Hell afterwards,

284
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:41,2
where I ruled as king
over the souls of the damned.

285
00:13:43,007 --> 00:13:44,9
Lucifer, it all makes sense now.

286
00:13:50,074 --> 00:13:53,5
Damn it, I tried to keep a straight face,
I really did.

287
00:13:53,091 --> 00:13:57,6
Man, how?
How do you stay in character like that?

288
00:13:57,075 --> 00:13:59,5
It's simple really. It's all true.

289
00:13:59,058 --> 00:14:02,0
Oh, and my brother, Amenadiel,
he's an angel.

290
00:14:02,063 --> 00:14:04,8
Ah, does he have wings?

291
00:14:04,092 --> 00:14:06,5
-He does again actually.
-[both laugh]

292
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:09,1
-You think he can give me a ride?
-You should ask him.

293
00:14:09,026 --> 00:14:11,9
-[Lucifer laughs]
-This guy. You're so funny!

294
00:14:12,001 --> 00:14:15,6
Ah! Why would you think that I'm not
telling the truth, Miss Lopez?

295
00:14:15,072 --> 00:14:17,5
I stopped trying to figure that out
years ago.

296
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:20,6
I mean, hey, we all got our quirks, right?

297
00:14:20,077 --> 00:14:22,7
Mine is that I'm, like,
actually the Devil.

298
00:14:22,086 --> 00:14:24,1
-Oh, right!
-[Lucifer laughs]

299
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:26,0
-[Chloe laughs]
-[Ella laughs]

300
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:28,9
Oh, so do you have any new info
on the case?

301
00:14:29,007 --> 00:14:30,0
Uh, yes.

302
00:14:30,024 --> 00:14:31,8
So, it turns out

303
00:14:31,091 --> 00:14:34,5
the honey scraper couldn't have
belonged to the victim's collection,

304
00:14:34,066 --> 00:14:37,5
because it had, wait for it...

305
00:14:37,096 --> 00:14:40,0
honey on it.

306
00:14:40,058 --> 00:14:41,5
And isn't that the point?

307
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:44,2
[Ella]
Bob and Lenore's specialty was varietals.

308
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:47,4
You know, blueberry honey,
cinnamon honey. But this right here...

309
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:50,0
good, old-fashioned plain honey, honey.

310
00:14:50,013 --> 00:14:52,0
So this honey came from somewhere else.

311
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:54,9
So maybe a rival came with his own tool
to destroy the hive.

312
00:14:55,001 --> 00:14:57,1
And then used it to kill Bob
when he caught them.

313
00:14:57,027 --> 00:14:59,8
How devilish. And I would know, after all.

314
00:15:00,014 --> 00:15:00,9
You're the Devil.

315
00:15:01,006 --> 00:15:02,2
[laughing] I really am.

316
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:03,6
[Ella laughs]

317
00:15:03,073 --> 00:15:04,9
[clears throat] Right.

318
00:15:05,069 --> 00:15:07,6
[Lucifer] Isn't this fun, Detective?

319
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:08,6
[Chloe] What's that?

320
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:12,2
Well, now you know the truth about me
and, as you said, fine with it...

321
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:15,0
-Mm-hmm.
-Well, we can both be in on the joke.

322
00:15:15,012 --> 00:15:19,4
You can watch humans twist themselves
into pretzels to justify what I tell them

323
00:15:19,054 --> 00:15:21,5
instead of considering
the most obvious answer.

324
00:15:22,033 --> 00:15:24,9
-[Chloe] I think it's kind of mean.
-What?

325
00:15:25,013 --> 00:15:28,7
Well, no-one in their right mind
is going to believe

326
00:15:28,084 --> 00:15:31,0
that you're actually, you know, the Devil.

327
00:15:31,018 --> 00:15:33,0
-Oh.
-Well, without proof.

328
00:15:33,018 --> 00:15:36,5
So of course they're going to try
and figure out the metaphor.

329
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,6
Or perhaps you're just smarting
from never figuring it out yourself.

330
00:15:39,068 --> 00:15:41,4
-[chuckles]
-Maybe a little bit.

331
00:15:41,081 --> 00:15:45,4
So here's Bob and Lenore's stand.
They're newer to the farmers' market.

332
00:15:45,052 --> 00:15:48,9
Whereas Pure Honey,
they've been here for years.

333
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,9
Maybe they didn't like the competition
moving in next door.

334
00:15:51,099 --> 00:15:55,1
Destroy the rival hive
and suddenly he's back to being queen bee.

335
00:15:56,095 --> 00:16:00,6
Detective, since you're clearly
comfortable with my devilishness...

336
00:16:00,075 --> 00:16:02,1
-[chuckles]
-Yeah.

337
00:16:02,025 --> 00:16:04,0
Care to see my mojo in action?

338
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,7
Sure. Why not?

339
00:16:06,063 --> 00:16:07,5
Right.

340
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,2
Welcome.

341
00:16:09,055 --> 00:16:10,7
What can I get for you?

342
00:16:11,022 --> 00:16:14,1
Uh, LAPD, Detective Decker.
Do you own this stand?

343
00:16:14,026 --> 00:16:16,0
Yeah. Glenn Dobbs.

344
00:16:16,014 --> 00:16:17,6
Lovely. Tell me, Glenn...

345
00:16:18,064 --> 00:16:19,9
what is it you desire?

346
00:16:20,002 --> 00:16:21,1
Excuse me?

347
00:16:21,018 --> 00:16:23,3
Well, I like to draw out
all those naughty,

348
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,1
hidden desires of humanity.

349
00:16:26,015 --> 00:16:29,6
Though, you seem like someone
who really wants to unburden himself.

350
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,7
I...

351
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,9
[Glenn stammers] I...

352
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,3
I want...

353
00:16:36,045 --> 00:16:37,9
-Go on.
-I...

354
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,8
Wait, w-what's happening?

355
00:16:44,054 --> 00:16:45,6
Lucifer, you may want to...

356
00:16:46,033 --> 00:16:47,8
Right, yes. Glenn...

357
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,5
Glenn, tell me...

358
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,4
what is it you desire?

359
00:16:54,005 --> 00:16:55,9
I want Bob Goldbach to die.

360
00:16:56,034 --> 00:16:57,1
Oh.

361
00:16:57,097 --> 00:17:01,2
Case solved, Detective.
Here I was, worried we'd be rusty.

362
00:17:01,031 --> 00:17:04,7
You want him to die? Why? Because
he was going to threaten your business?

363
00:17:04,081 --> 00:17:06,1
What? No.

364
00:17:06,077 --> 00:17:09,6
-It's because I'm terrified of him.
-[chuckles] You're terrified of Bob?

365
00:17:09,077 --> 00:17:11,8
Chubby, harmless, and very dead Bob?

366
00:17:12,003 --> 00:17:12,9
Bob's dead?

367
00:17:13,003 --> 00:17:14,0
Very.

368
00:17:14,015 --> 00:17:16,6
Oh, thank God. I can finally relax.

369
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,1
Why were you scared of Bob?

370
00:17:19,053 --> 00:17:20,7
Let's talk in private.

371
00:17:24,091 --> 00:17:26,0
[Glenn] Okay, fine.

372
00:17:26,037 --> 00:17:27,9
I destroyed their beehive.

373
00:17:28,038 --> 00:17:31,3
[Glenn] I was pissed
that Bob and Lenore's gimmicky honey

374
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:33,1
was putting my stand out of business.

375
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:35,9
I mean, avocado honey?

376
00:17:36,047 --> 00:17:37,4
Come on.

377
00:17:37,068 --> 00:17:40,2
I'm from LA
and even I think that's going too far.

378
00:17:40,047 --> 00:17:43,0
But when Bob caught you,
you killed him, didn't you?

379
00:17:43,014 --> 00:17:44,7
[Glenn] No, I went home,

380
00:17:44,081 --> 00:17:47,7
and a couple of hours later,
Bob showed up at my front door.

381
00:17:47,081 --> 00:17:49,4
So he confronted you. What did he say?

382
00:17:49,056 --> 00:17:50,4
Say?

383
00:17:50,081 --> 00:17:52,3
He didn't say anything.

384
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:53,9
[winces]

385
00:17:55,044 --> 00:17:56,5
Bob did that to you?

386
00:17:56,061 --> 00:17:58,4
It was like he was a different person.

387
00:17:58,049 --> 00:18:00,0
He wasn't angry. He was...

388
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:01,9
He was so calm.

389
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,5
It made it even scarier, you know?

390
00:18:04,062 --> 00:18:06,0
What did you do after he left?

391
00:18:06,016 --> 00:18:08,5
Are you kidding me?
I went to the hospital.

392
00:18:08,062 --> 00:18:10,0
Right. Show me again.

393
00:18:11,042 --> 00:18:15,1
Detective, I have definitely
seen work like this before,

394
00:18:15,026 --> 00:18:16,0
in Hell.

395
00:18:16,067 --> 00:18:17,6
You know, where I'm...

396
00:18:17,084 --> 00:18:18,7
Mm-hmm.

397
00:18:18,084 --> 00:18:19,8
Never mind.

398
00:18:20,005 --> 00:18:21,6
A bag of billiard balls perhaps.

399
00:18:21,076 --> 00:18:23,4
-Not quite round enough, is it?
-Ow!

400
00:18:23,081 --> 00:18:25,8
It was doorknobs, of all things.

401
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:28,2
I mean, who does that?

402
00:18:30,077 --> 00:18:31,6
[Chloe] Huh.

403
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,9
Well, his story checks out. Glenn was
at the hospital at the time of death.

404
00:18:36,007 --> 00:18:38,9
Oh. So Bob wasn't as mild-mannered
as we first thought.

405
00:18:38,099 --> 00:18:40,4
Hm. Apparently not.

406
00:18:40,095 --> 00:18:43,0
But a bag of doorknobs? It's...

407
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,7
so specific.

408
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,8
Was it a message?

409
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,2
If so, it was lost on that poor chap.

410
00:18:48,037 --> 00:18:49,3
Huh.

411
00:18:52,042 --> 00:18:53,9
[Lucifer] What on earth are you doing?

412
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,4
[Chloe] I think we're being followed.
Looks like he's got a gun.

413
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:05,7
Detective, this is a chance
for me to use my devilish strength.

414
00:19:05,085 --> 00:19:07,4
You can see what I'm truly capable of.

415
00:19:07,052 --> 00:19:09,7
Or I can just point my gun at him
and yell, "Freeze!"

416
00:19:09,085 --> 00:19:10,9
Oh, come on.

417
00:19:11,023 --> 00:19:13,8
I've never really seen
how far I can actually throw a human.

418
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:16,7

-Joking. Mostly.

419
00:19:18,078 --> 00:19:20,3
Okay. He's all yours.

422

Lucifer, stop!

423
00:19:26,091 --> 00:19:29,6
I see you're not as comfortable
with my true nature as you claim.

424
00:19:29,071 --> 00:19:32,0
What? No, it's not that. He's got a badge!

425
00:19:32,075 --> 00:19:34,2

426
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:36,4
[man chokes]

427
00:19:36,055 --> 00:19:38,0
Why were you following us?

428
00:19:38,009 --> 00:19:40,9
Because your victim
was in witness protection.

429
00:19:44,051 --> 00:19:46,1
US Marshal Luke Reynolds.

430
00:19:48,043 --> 00:19:49,4
Hi.

431
00:19:54,048 --> 00:19:55,7
You were Bob's handler?

432
00:19:56,023 --> 00:19:59,0
I, uh, kept tabs on him,
made sure he was safe.

433
00:20:00,044 --> 00:20:02,8
Failed pretty spectacularly
at that, though, didn't I?

434
00:20:02,091 --> 00:20:04,2
You certainly did.

435
00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:06,4
Well, he asked.

436
00:20:06,087 --> 00:20:08,5
[Chloe]
So why were you following us outside?

437
00:20:08,099 --> 00:20:10,5
You could have approached us at any time.

438
00:20:10,066 --> 00:20:13,3
I know. Sorry, but when you're dealing
with someone like Bob the Knob--

439
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:16,7
[Lucifer snickers]
Sorry. Seriously? Bob the Knob?

440
00:20:16,084 --> 00:20:17,6
[Lucifer laughs]

441
00:20:17,075 --> 00:20:20,1
What was he in witness protection for?
Bad porn?

442
00:20:20,021 --> 00:20:23,1
Bob was an enforcer
for the Paradiso crime syndicate.

443
00:20:23,063 --> 00:20:26,6
His signature was beating people half
to death with a bag full of doorknobs.

444
00:20:26,072 --> 00:20:29,1
Paradisos have a pretty ruthless
reputation.

445
00:20:29,018 --> 00:20:34,2
I've never dealt with them myself, but
if Bob was high up in the organization...

446
00:20:34,069 --> 00:20:37,3
They're based out of New York,
but have their fingers everywhere.

447
00:20:37,044 --> 00:20:39,9
Look, no offense to the LAPD.
I just didn't know who to trust.

448
00:20:40,053 --> 00:20:42,5
Especially since no-one
should've known Bob was here.

449
00:20:42,065 --> 00:20:45,3
So you think
the Paradisos were responsible for this?

450
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:47,3
A group of them came to town
a couple of days ago

451
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:49,0
and I don't think it was
for the sunshine.

452
00:20:49,012 --> 00:20:51,0
-Did you talk to them?
-What's the point?

453
00:20:51,062 --> 00:20:53,0
They won't talk to law enforcement.

454
00:20:53,008 --> 00:20:54,2
Oh, you'd be surprised.

455
00:20:54,029 --> 00:20:57,3
I mean, after all,
she has the Devil at her side.

456
00:20:59,071 --> 00:21:01,9
Maybe it is kind of fun being in the know.

457
00:21:14,002 --> 00:21:15,1

460
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:24,7
Maze.

461
00:21:26,074 --> 00:21:28,2
You scared me. What...

462
00:21:30,003 --> 00:21:31,2
What the hell are you doing?

463
00:21:32,004 --> 00:21:33,1
I heard you were back.

464
00:21:34,096 --> 00:21:37,0
And I know that you know...

465
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,3
You know.

466
00:21:39,067 --> 00:21:40,5
Right.

467
00:21:41,013 --> 00:21:43,1
So you just hid in the dark and...

468
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,8
waited for the creepiest moment ever
to say something?

469
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:48,2
Old habits, I guess.

470
00:21:50,093 --> 00:21:54,4
Look, I know you're probably
really freaked out, so...

471
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,2
Good faith gesture.

472
00:22:00,006 --> 00:22:02,7
I'm locked into these.
You have nothing to worry about.

473
00:22:03,028 --> 00:22:05,2
Look, I need you to know...

474
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,7
Chloe, that even though I'm a demon...

475
00:22:10,074 --> 00:22:11,9
I would never hurt you.

476
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:14,3

477
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,0
Yeah?

478
00:22:17,062 --> 00:22:18,5
Really.

479
00:22:19,021 --> 00:22:20,0
Good.

480
00:22:22,042 --> 00:22:23,4
Good faith, huh?

481
00:22:23,084 --> 00:22:26,0
Well, you thought you were safe.

482
00:22:26,084 --> 00:22:28,6
That's all that matters, right?

483
00:22:28,076 --> 00:22:29,6
Is it?

484
00:22:30,005 --> 00:22:31,3
So where's Trixie?

485
00:22:32,005 --> 00:22:34,1
I was hoping to see her, too.

486
00:22:34,097 --> 00:22:36,6
Oh, yeah. Uh...

487
00:22:36,085 --> 00:22:37,7
She's at Dan's.

488
00:22:37,081 --> 00:22:40,6
You know, obviously,
she hasn't seen him for a while,

489
00:22:40,077 --> 00:22:43,2
so she's gonna stay with him for a bit.

490
00:22:43,052 --> 00:22:44,4
Oh, yeah, sure.

491
00:22:44,073 --> 00:22:46,0
I'll just swing by and say hi.

00:22:46,011 --> 00:22:47,0
[Chloe] I don't--

493
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,6
I don't think that's a good idea, Maze.

494
00:22:52,078 --> 00:22:53,7
I knew it.

495
00:22:54,095 --> 00:22:56,7

I'm sorry, I just... I don't...

499
00:23:06,055 --> 00:23:09,0
I don't see her getting over it
anytime soon.

500

you know the truth.

I agree.

515
00:24:09,023 --> 00:24:11,8
You know,
I'm actually going to miss you, brother.

516
00:24:11,095 --> 00:24:13,6
Miss me? What do you mean?

517
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:15,0
Well, your wings are back.

518
00:24:15,012 --> 00:24:18,4
You can finally go home for good,

519
00:24:19,004 --> 00:24:21,2
I suppose that has been
my ultimate goal, all right.

520
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:23,1
Honestly,
I'm surprised you returned at all.

521

No, no, it's...

00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:30,8
I'm happy for you, brother.

Ah. Now, what's that?

527
00:24:35,026 --> 00:24:37,3
The Detective knows what I really am.

528
00:24:39,047 --> 00:24:40,3
Oh, Lucy.

00:24:41,073 --> 00:24:42,7
Are you all right?

00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:43,8
Do you need my help?

Well, that's just it.

Apparently,
it seems that she's fine with it.

00:24:48,015 --> 00:24:50,4
I know. I was skeptical myself, but...

534
00:24:51,082 --> 00:24:53,6
I think it may really be true.

00:24:53,082 --> 00:24:54,7
Are you sure?

536
00:24:54,082 --> 00:24:58,3
Because if you need me to stay,
I will stay for as long as it takes--

Brother...

538
00:24:59,095 --> 00:25:00,8
go home.

00:25:43,004 --> 00:25:46,4
Bob the Knob was murdered
here in LA recently

552
00:25:46,054 --> 00:25:48,8
and here you are on vacation.

553
00:25:48,092 --> 00:25:50,8
World's full of coincidences, ain't it?

554
00:25:51,034 --> 00:25:52,7
Now, if you'll excuse me...

555
00:25:57,084 --> 00:25:58,9
[Chloe clears throat]

556
00:26:01,056 --> 00:26:03,1
When was the last time you saw Bob?

557
00:26:04,077 --> 00:26:06,7
If I had to think, it was on the stand,

558
00:26:06,081 --> 00:26:08,2
testifying against my uncle.

559
00:26:08,069 --> 00:26:10,9
Getting himself a sweet deal
in the process.

560
00:26:10,098 --> 00:26:11,8
He's lying.

561
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:15,0
Although you probably knew that,
what with him being a mobster and all.

562
00:26:15,024 --> 00:26:16,6
But I actually have proof.

563
00:26:17,028 --> 00:26:20,2
I made a little discovery
whilst investigating the cheese platter.

564
00:26:20,053 --> 00:26:21,6
It's delicious stuff.

565
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:23,3
Avocado honey, who knew?

566
00:26:23,045 --> 00:26:25,2
-Pretty great, right?
-[Lucifer] Mm!

567
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:29,7
All right, all right.
We found out Bob was living in LA.

568
00:26:30,058 --> 00:26:32,2
We didn't have any reason to kill him.

569
00:26:32,029 --> 00:26:34,2
My files say you and Bob hated each other.

570
00:26:34,034 --> 00:26:38,1
We had a rivalry. He had his whole
doorknobs thing and, as for me--

571
00:26:38,026 --> 00:26:40,7
You kill people in swimming pools,
hence the name Pool Boy.

572
00:26:40,084 --> 00:26:43,0
It's very clever.
I see what you've done there.

573
00:26:43,014 --> 00:26:44,0
Allegedly killed.

574
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:47,3
But as we got older,
we learned to respect each other.

575
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,8
Okay, say I believe that.

576
00:26:48,089 --> 00:26:52,3
Bob still put your uncle in jail
for 50 years because he testified.

577
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:54,0
Yeah, and we owe him for that.

578
00:26:54,015 --> 00:26:56,3
-What do you mean?
-Uncle Vin was a bastard.

579
00:26:56,053 --> 00:26:58,3
Bob did everyone a favor
by taking him out.

580
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:00,7
And as for the honey,
it isn't what it looks like.

581
00:27:00,086 --> 00:27:03,2
It looks like you got a delicious trophy
after a kill.

582
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:06,4
A couple weeks ago,

583
00:27:06,054 --> 00:27:09,4
we got an anonymous note
that Bob was in LA.

584
00:27:09,071 --> 00:27:11,8
We came here to warn him.
That's when we tried the honey.

585
00:27:12,067 --> 00:27:14,5
Almost as sweet as that Lenore of his.

586
00:27:14,063 --> 00:27:15,5
Can I see the note?

587
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:17,2
Wish I could help you.

588
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,6
I gave it to Bob.

589
00:27:20,043 --> 00:27:22,8
[Chloe] So I saw security cameras
at the farmers' market.

590
00:27:22,089 --> 00:27:26,2
We can check the footage to see
if Pool Boy Paradiso or anybody else

591
00:27:26,035 --> 00:27:28,3
visited Lenore and Bob's stand, okay?

592
00:27:28,089 --> 00:27:29,7
Thanks, Dan.

593
00:27:30,027 --> 00:27:31,9
[Lucifer] Ah. That was disappointing.

594
00:27:32,023 --> 00:27:33,7
[Chloe] We haven't hit a dead end yet.

595
00:27:33,081 --> 00:27:35,6
No, no.
When I heard his name was Pool Boy,

596
00:27:35,077 --> 00:27:37,9
I pictured
a much more Baywatch-esque suspect.

597
00:27:38,007 --> 00:27:39,2
[both laugh]

598
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:40,9
-Listen, Detective--
-[Chloe gasps]

599
00:27:42,032 --> 00:27:43,2
Sorry.

600
00:27:44,012 --> 00:27:44,9
What's wrong?

601
00:27:45,003 --> 00:27:47,1
Nothing's wrong. Nothing.
Everything's okay.

602
00:27:47,024 --> 00:27:48,2
I just...

603
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:50,6
You startled me. Everything's okay.

604
00:28:00,022 --> 00:28:01,4
You believe Pool Boy?

605
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:02,8
Really?

606
00:28:02,093 --> 00:28:03,8
His story tracks.

607
00:28:04,047 --> 00:28:07,3
He has an alibi for the night of
the murder that completely checks out.

608
00:28:07,047 --> 00:28:09,4
Alibis can be bought, or threatened.

609
00:28:09,052 --> 00:28:11,1
These guys are monsters, Detective Decker.

610
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:12,9
And I'm not taking my eye off any of them,

611
00:28:13,006 --> 00:28:16,0
but I believe him when he says
that he got an anonymous tip.

612
00:28:16,015 --> 00:28:18,9
If the note exists,
whoever wrote it wanted Bob dead.

613
00:28:19,003 --> 00:28:20,1
That's who we need to find.

614
00:28:21,049 --> 00:28:23,2
Did Lenore know about Bob's past?

615
00:28:23,028 --> 00:28:25,4
I don't know. I never met her.

616
00:28:25,049 --> 00:28:27,0
Bob certainly wasn't
supposed to tell her,

617
00:28:27,016 --> 00:28:29,6
but then again he wasn't supposed
to attack a honey bee farmer

618
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:31,6
with a bag full of doorknobs either, so...

619
00:28:32,029 --> 00:28:34,8
Look, we do our best at WITSEC,
but these guys, they...

620
00:28:35,042 --> 00:28:36,5
They can't help themselves.

621
00:28:36,067 --> 00:28:40,5
Lenore didn't seem to know
when I interviewed her, but Pool Boy...

622
00:28:41,013 --> 00:28:43,0
He acted as if they had already met.

623
00:28:43,076 --> 00:28:44,8
So she knew the truth.

624
00:28:44,093 --> 00:28:46,1
Then maybe she saw the note.

625
00:28:46,097 --> 00:28:48,3
[Lucifer] Daniel, there you are.

626
00:28:48,068 --> 00:28:52,4
I need some advice in an area
I assume you have extensive expertise.

627
00:28:54,094 --> 00:28:57,8
What does it mean
when a woman recoils at your touch?

628
00:29:01,044 --> 00:29:02,2
Nope.

629
00:29:02,094 --> 00:29:04,7
I am not playing that game anymore.

630
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,1
Excuse me?

631
00:29:06,049 --> 00:29:08,7
You say something insulting,
stupid, but...

632
00:29:09,045 --> 00:29:11,3
kind of funny, and I just shrug it off.

633
00:29:11,045 --> 00:29:12,5
It was our schtick.

634
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:14,0
But we are not friends.

635
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,9
Not anymore.

636
00:29:17,042 --> 00:29:19,8
But I'll tell you what,
I'll give you an answer.

637
00:29:20,013 --> 00:29:20,9
Thank you.

638
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,8
It means that they hate you.

639
00:29:23,084 --> 00:29:26,3
That they want you
as far away from them as possible,

640
00:29:26,038 --> 00:29:27,8
because your very touch...

641
00:29:28,034 --> 00:29:29,5
makes them recoil...

642
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:31,4
in disgust.

643
00:29:33,027 --> 00:29:35,1
What? Hm?

644
00:29:36,027 --> 00:29:37,6
No funny quip to that?

645
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:46,3
Hey.

646
00:29:47,049 --> 00:29:48,3
Where's Lucifer?

647
00:29:50,095 --> 00:29:52,5
I don't know and I don't care.

648
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:55,7
Well, he was supposed to come with me
to interview Lenore.

649
00:29:55,083 --> 00:29:57,4
Well, I guess it's just you and me.

650
00:29:58,017 --> 00:30:00,6
[Lucifer] The Detective
is in deeper denial than I thought.

651
00:30:04,092 --> 00:30:07,1
All right, I'm going to give you advice
on how to help her.

652
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:08,6
Finally. Thank you, Doctor.

653
00:30:08,076 --> 00:30:11,5
But I'm going to need a good metaphor.
Hmm.

654
00:30:12,022 --> 00:30:13,6
Let's use...

655
00:30:14,002 --> 00:30:14,8
you...

656
00:30:15,014 --> 00:30:16,1
as an example.

657
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:19,4
Oh, role play. It's been a while, Doctor.

658
00:30:19,052 --> 00:30:22,1
We don't have the clown masks with us,
but I'm still game.

659
00:30:22,027 --> 00:30:23,9
Okay. Well, If you were in denial,

660
00:30:24,003 --> 00:30:28,3
and if that denial forced you
to face a truth that...

661
00:30:29,049 --> 00:30:32,9
scared you
more than you'd like to admit...

662
00:30:33,058 --> 00:30:34,5
Go on.

663
00:30:34,062 --> 00:30:37,0
I'd say that you were
projecting your issues

664
00:30:37,008 --> 00:30:39,7
onto whatever you were dealing with
in that moment.

665
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:41,3
Or...

666
00:30:42,034 --> 00:30:44,6
whomever you were dealing with.

667
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:45,5
[sighs]

668
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:48,5
I see what you're saying, Doctor.
Thank you.

669
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:50,5
Do you?

670
00:30:51,001 --> 00:30:54,4
Well, the Detective is clearly
projecting her issues onto the case.

671
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:57,8
So to understand her, I need to use the
case to help her understand her feelings.

672
00:30:58,006 --> 00:30:59,6
And in so doing,

673
00:31:00,002 --> 00:31:02,0
understand your own feelings as well?

674
00:31:03,065 --> 00:31:04,8
[Lucifer scoffs]

675
00:31:11,024 --> 00:31:12,8
Hey, Dan, I've been meaning to say,

676
00:31:12,095 --> 00:31:15,1
you know, I... I'm sorry
that I wasn't here for you

677
00:31:15,024 --> 00:31:16,7
when you were dealing with...

678
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,8
well, everything.

679
00:31:17,095 --> 00:31:20,2
[Dan] I don't know how much
of a difference it'd have made.

680
00:31:20,033 --> 00:31:22,0
I just threw myself into work, you know?

681
00:31:22,021 --> 00:31:24,4
[Chloe] No, but still, now I'm here
to pick up the slack,

682
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:26,5
so if you want to,
take some time off to mourn.

683
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,0
The job is kind of like my therapy.
It's exactly where I need to be right now.

684
00:31:30,084 --> 00:31:32,3
Okay, but you know, I'm here to talk.

685
00:31:32,043 --> 00:31:33,3
Look, I know.

686
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,7
And thank you.

687
00:31:37,093 --> 00:31:39,3
There is something, though.

688
00:31:39,048 --> 00:31:40,3
What's up?

689
00:31:40,044 --> 00:31:43,2
What's Trixie's obsession with gelato?

690
00:31:43,077 --> 00:31:44,6
Oh, my God.

691
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:47,4
It was hard getting her to leave Rome
after she discovered that stuff.

692
00:31:47,057 --> 00:31:48,9
[suspenseful music playing]

693
00:32:14,076 --> 00:32:18,3
Okay, so the neighbor saw Lenore leave
carrying a gym bag,

694
00:32:18,047 --> 00:32:20,1
alone and in a hurry.
She took her own car.

695
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:23,0
So what? She was involved
in her husband's murder and then ran?

696
00:32:23,014 --> 00:32:24,9
She could have written the anonymous note.

697
00:32:25,027 --> 00:32:28,8
When it didn't work, maybe she killed him
herself or found someone else to do it.

698
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:31,5
[Lucifer] Or she found out the truth
about the man she loved

699
00:32:31,061 --> 00:32:32,7
and it drove her away.

700
00:32:32,095 --> 00:32:36,0
What do you think she would have felt
in that moment? Horror? Disgust?

701
00:32:36,024 --> 00:32:37,2
Mild arousal?

702
00:32:37,033 --> 00:32:39,6
I don't think that's really helping
right now, Lucifer.

703
00:32:39,074 --> 00:32:42,9
Understanding her perspective will help us
understand her actions, Detective.

704
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,3
You know what?
You know, that's a good point.

705
00:32:46,042 --> 00:32:49,0
I'm sure she felt betrayed...

706
00:32:49,084 --> 00:32:51,7
Confused. Scared, even.

707
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,8
Is that why you think she ran?
Because she was afraid of him?

708
00:32:56,014 --> 00:32:58,2
Lenore may have lied
about what she knew about Bob,

709
00:32:58,035 --> 00:33:00,3
but she was genuinely grief-stricken
at the crime scene.

710
00:33:00,043 --> 00:33:02,2
So I think we're missing something.

711
00:33:02,031 --> 00:33:03,5
Ella, what did she leave with?

712
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:07,3
Clothes, toiletries. Your standard
get-the-hell-out-of-town go bag.

713
00:33:07,044 --> 00:33:08,6
Oh, and...

714
00:33:09,073 --> 00:33:10,7
her wedding album.

715
00:33:11,073 --> 00:33:14,5
You don't take a wedding album
if you've murdered your husband.

716
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,6
[Chloe] Dan, what did you see
on the farmers' market footage?

717
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:20,4
Just one visit from Pool Boy Paradiso,
like he claimed.

718
00:33:20,058 --> 00:33:22,9
Oh, and Marshal Reynolds.
A couple of times, actually.

719
00:33:23,004 --> 00:33:25,6
And was it only Bob
that Reynolds was talking to?

720
00:33:25,075 --> 00:33:27,8
Well, he spoke to Lenore once. Why?

721
00:33:27,092 --> 00:33:29,5
Well, he said that they had never met.

722
00:33:33,009 --> 00:33:36,3
I don't-- I'm fine.
Whatever. It doesn't matter.

723
00:33:36,038 --> 00:33:38,8
[Linda]
Maze, you and I both know that's not true.

724
00:33:39,026 --> 00:33:40,9
Trixie means a lot to you.

725
00:33:41,001 --> 00:33:43,2
And she's the last person
you need to make up with

726
00:33:43,031 --> 00:33:45,6
since your backslide into demon-dom.

727
00:33:45,081 --> 00:33:46,6
I'm...

728
00:33:47,002 --> 00:33:49,2
Okay, Linda, what is going on with you?

729
00:33:49,036 --> 00:33:51,0
Do you need to pee or something?

730
00:33:51,011 --> 00:33:54,6
No. I sit all day. It's nice to be able
to move around when I get a chance.

731
00:33:55,049 --> 00:33:56,4
Okay.

732
00:33:56,049 --> 00:33:58,9
So let's talk about
what you're dealing with emotionally.

733
00:33:59,045 --> 00:34:00,7
Yeah, I really don't want to.

734
00:34:00,078 --> 00:34:02,9
Maybe it would help
if I spoke your language.

735
00:34:03,004 --> 00:34:04,0
You speak Lilim?

736
00:34:05,004 --> 00:34:09,1
[speaking in Lilim in a deep voice]

737
00:34:09,092 --> 00:34:10,7
What?

738
00:34:11,038 --> 00:34:12,9
No, guess not.

739
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:15,2
No, I'm talking about violence.

740
00:34:15,059 --> 00:34:16,4
Come on, stand up.

741
00:34:16,072 --> 00:34:17,5
Okay.

742
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:20,9
One, I like to fight when I'm happy or...

743
00:34:21,051 --> 00:34:22,4
horny.

744
00:34:22,068 --> 00:34:26,9
And, two, I really don't want
to accidentally kill my best friend.

745
00:34:27,052 --> 00:34:29,6
No. Well, I think you
underestimate me, Maze.

746
00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:31,9
Uh, I've been doing some kickboxing.

747
00:34:32,002 --> 00:34:32,9
I've got moves.

748
00:34:34,011 --> 00:34:34,9
Um...

749
00:34:36,065 --> 00:34:37,7
I'll let you take a free--

750
00:34:37,078 --> 00:34:38,8
Hey!

751
00:34:39,024 --> 00:34:41,4
-Linda!
-Stop it, you two.

752
00:34:41,078 --> 00:34:42,8
It's good I'm here.

753
00:34:42,095 --> 00:34:45,4
I can't allow you guys to fight over me
any longer.

754
00:34:46,058 --> 00:34:47,7
-Uh...
-Oh...

755
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:50,0
Ah, you're not fighting over me,

756
00:34:50,067 --> 00:34:51,5
are you?

757
00:34:52,009 --> 00:34:55,3
No, but it's sweet of you to think so.

758
00:34:55,042 --> 00:34:56,4
[Linda chuckles]

759
00:34:56,096 --> 00:34:58,4
We made up a month or so ago.

760
00:35:00,005 --> 00:35:01,3
So do you need my help?

761
00:35:02,035 --> 00:35:03,1
With this or...

762
00:35:04,089 --> 00:35:06,5
anything else?

763
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:07,9
No, we're good.

764
00:35:08,027 --> 00:35:09,1
[Maze] We're good.

765
00:35:10,085 --> 00:35:12,3
[Linda] Are you okay?

766
00:35:13,023 --> 00:35:15,2
I went back home to the Silver City.

767
00:35:16,073 --> 00:35:18,0
That's amazing.

768
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:20,8
It should be.
It's exactly as I remembered it, but...

769
00:35:23,024 --> 00:35:25,0
Why did it feel so...

770
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,5
different?

771
00:35:29,004 --> 00:35:30,1
Why didn't it feel like...

772
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,8
Like home?

773
00:35:34,009 --> 00:35:34,9
[sighs]

774
00:35:35,004 --> 00:35:37,1
Because this is your home.

775
00:35:42,022 --> 00:35:43,0
[Chloe] Ugh.

776
00:35:43,014 --> 00:35:45,1
I'm just getting Reynolds' voicemail.

777
00:35:45,081 --> 00:35:47,1
Any luck tracing his phone?

778
00:35:47,027 --> 00:35:51,0
I'm triangulating it now.
Not sure how long it'll take, though.

779
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:53,1
Or whether or not
he had anything to do with this.

780
00:35:53,019 --> 00:35:56,9
I think he did. I made a couple
of discreet calls to the Marshals' office.

781
00:35:57,011 --> 00:35:59,1
Two of the ex-cons under
Reynolds' protection

782
00:35:59,028 --> 00:36:00,7
have died in the last couple years.

783
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,2
-Who killed them?
-That's it.

784
00:36:02,036 --> 00:36:03,7
One was an angry girlfriend.

785
00:36:03,082 --> 00:36:06,4
The other was a hit and run
that looked like it was mob-related.

786
00:36:06,049 --> 00:36:09,7
So our dear Marshal weaponized
the very secrets only he knew.

787
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:12,8
He let certain enemies know
where the criminals were hiding.

788
00:36:12,096 --> 00:36:15,8
Or told the new wives the truth,
knowing how betrayed they'd feel.

789
00:36:15,096 --> 00:36:18,0
And voila, the dirty work
was done for him.

790
00:36:18,013 --> 00:36:19,4
That is remarkably efficient.

791
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,3
But in Bob's case, nobody took the bait.

792
00:36:21,042 --> 00:36:25,6
So maybe Reynolds got frustrated
and decided to get his own hands dirty?

793
00:36:25,068 --> 00:36:26,6
The question is, why?

794
00:36:26,093 --> 00:36:29,1
I'll keep digging, see if I can find more.

795
00:36:32,027 --> 00:36:34,2
So, why did Lenore run?

796
00:36:34,035 --> 00:36:36,6
Well, if Reynolds met with her
previously...

797
00:36:37,023 --> 00:36:38,7
then probably she trusts him.

798
00:36:39,028 --> 00:36:42,6
So maybe he reached out to her
to tell her she was in danger.

799
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:44,9
Oh, and little did she know
how true that was.

800
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:48,5
Just got a hit on Reynolds' GPS, so,
you know, it might be a good idea to...

801
00:36:50,058 --> 00:36:52,0
[whispers] You guys got this.

802
00:36:59,055 --> 00:37:01,3
[whimpering] Why?

803
00:37:01,042 --> 00:37:02,7
Why are you doing this?

804
00:37:03,097 --> 00:37:04,8
Please...

805
00:37:05,026 --> 00:37:07,7
[sobbing] Please tell me. Don't! Don't.

806
00:37:07,085 --> 00:37:08,6
I'm sorry.

807
00:37:09,085 --> 00:37:11,3
-There's no other way.
-Please, don't.

808
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:12,7
[Lucifer] Sure there is!

809
00:37:12,081 --> 00:37:15,5
There are loads of ways to kill her.
Literally tons.

810
00:37:16,031 --> 00:37:19,6
But you chose to use
Frank "Pool Boy" Paradiso's MO

811
00:37:19,069 --> 00:37:21,5
to frame him and tie up loose ends.

812
00:37:22,003 --> 00:37:22,9
It's very clever.

813
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:25,3
[Chloe] Drop the gun, Reynolds. Step away.

814
00:37:25,091 --> 00:37:27,8
You don't understand.
I'm not the bad guy here.

815
00:37:27,095 --> 00:37:30,3
I've watched all these criminals
for years,

816
00:37:30,045 --> 00:37:34,6
living happy lives, being rewarded
for the terrible things that they did.

817
00:37:34,075 --> 00:37:37,4
Lenore's done nothing wrong. Let her go.

818
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:40,0
Oh, hasn't she? She forgave him.

819
00:37:40,009 --> 00:37:43,3
Even when he was exactly the same monster
he'd always been.

820
00:37:43,046 --> 00:37:46,8
You saw what he did to the guy
at the farmers' market. They never change.

821
00:37:46,088 --> 00:37:50,3
So maybe he slipped up.
We all do sometimes.

822
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:54,0
But at least he was trying
to make a better life for himself.

823
00:37:55,052 --> 00:37:56,7
And you stole it.

824
00:37:56,085 --> 00:37:58,6
You... You step back.

825
00:37:59,094 --> 00:38:00,9
Lucifer, don't!

826
00:38:01,002 --> 00:38:03,8
It's not your job to punish,
Marshal Reynolds.

827
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:05,7
It's mine. [snarls]

835
00:38:34,068 --> 00:38:35,9
Not quite.

836
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:39,6

Out.

[Maze] I'm in a rush.

857
00:39:46,075 --> 00:39:49,0
-Mind taking him the rest of the way?
-Who's this?

858
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:53,6
What am I, your secretary?
He's a bad guy. Figure it out.

859
00:40:05,011 --> 00:40:06,0
[Trixie] Maze.

860
00:40:11,015 --> 00:40:12,0

Hey, I'm...

862
00:40:17,041 --> 00:40:18,8
I've been wanting to talk to you.

863
00:40:21,066 --> 00:40:22,6
To tell you that...

864
00:40:23,054 --> 00:40:24,5
I'm sorry.

865
00:40:28,088 --> 00:40:30,8
-I'm so sorry for--
-[Trixie gasps]

866
00:40:34,076 --> 00:40:35,8
I know, dummy.

[Maze laughs]

868
00:40:38,031 --> 00:40:40,3
You're not... You're not mad at me?

869
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:42,5
Nah. I couldn't stay mad at you.

870
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,1
But your mom, she...

871
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:47,5
What?

872
00:40:48,002 --> 00:40:49,9
No-- No, never mind.

Hello, Dan.

[Dan gasps]

877
00:41:07,088 --> 00:41:08,7
Whoa.

878
00:41:09,025 --> 00:41:10,4
Dude... [chuckles]

879
00:41:11,042 --> 00:41:12,9
Whoa, I'm sorry man, I...

880
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:16,1
I must have been in my own head.
I thought I was alone.

881
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:18,6
Where the hell have you been?

882
00:41:19,014 --> 00:41:20,3
I went home for a bit.

883
00:41:20,089 --> 00:41:22,2
And no phones there?

884
00:41:22,048 --> 00:41:23,3
Actually, no.

885
00:41:23,089 --> 00:41:24,8
Oh.

886
00:41:26,044 --> 00:41:28,7
Dan, you're the most human person
that I know.

887
00:41:30,073 --> 00:41:31,5
Thanks?

888
00:41:31,078 --> 00:41:33,6
What made you choose to live here?

889
00:41:34,061 --> 00:41:35,7
In Los Angeles.

890
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:37,0
Uh...

891
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:40,1
The food is great.

892
00:41:41,062 --> 00:41:42,7
I love the ocean.

893
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:44,6
And...

894
00:41:45,033 --> 00:41:47,0
I guess I met people.

895
00:41:48,092 --> 00:41:50,0
People I care about.

896
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:53,3
I think somehow
it's become my home now, too.

897
00:41:54,042 --> 00:41:57,9
And it's time that I stop trying
to make excuses for wanting to stay

898
00:41:58,005 --> 00:41:59,6
and choose to stay.

899
00:42:00,014 --> 00:42:00,9
[chuckles]

900
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,8
That's great to hear, man.

901
00:42:06,031 --> 00:42:07,9
She's in Heaven, Dan.

902
00:42:12,002 --> 00:42:12,8
Don't.

903
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,7
I hate it when people say that.

904
00:42:20,041 --> 00:42:21,2
Look at me.

905
00:42:32,021 --> 00:42:33,0
She is.

906
00:42:35,046 --> 00:42:36,3
Trust me.

Hey.

916
00:43:20,018 --> 00:43:21,0
[Chloe laughs]

917
00:43:23,076 --> 00:43:24,7
[Chloe sighs]

918
00:43:24,085 --> 00:43:25,8
I used to...

919
00:43:26,052 --> 00:43:30,3
listen to that song on repeat
through high school a lot when...

920
00:43:32,044 --> 00:43:33,3
[Chloe sighs]

921
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:36,0
When I felt lost.

922
00:43:41,049 --> 00:43:42,7
Lucifer, about...

923
00:43:44,012 --> 00:43:44,9
what I saw--

924
00:43:45,003 --> 00:43:48,2
I've had literal eons
to come to terms with what you saw.

925
00:43:50,087 --> 00:43:51,7
My...

926
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:54,0
My monstrous side.

927
00:43:55,025 --> 00:43:56,1
[shudders]

928
00:43:56,021 --> 00:43:58,3
But it's not all that I am.

929
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,7
At least I hope not.

930
00:44:03,051 --> 00:44:04,9
[sighs]

931
00:44:05,001 --> 00:44:08,1
Either way, it's unfair of me
to expect you to just...

932
00:44:09,027 --> 00:44:10,1
accept it.

933
00:44:11,044 --> 00:44:13,3
I'm honestly not sure
when I'll be able to.

934
00:44:13,077 --> 00:44:15,1
[laughs]

935
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:16,0
If ever.

936
00:44:21,074 --> 00:44:24,2
Lucifer, what I was going to say was...

937
00:44:25,082 --> 00:44:27,0
What I saw...

938
00:44:31,008 --> 00:44:32,2
was my partner.

939
00:44:39,046 --> 00:44:40,3
Really?

940
00:44:42,038 --> 00:44:43,2
Really.

941
00:44:45,097 --> 00:44:46,9
Well, then...

942
00:44:48,006 --> 00:44:49,6
problem solved, Detective.

943
00:44:51,002 --> 00:44:52,7
Because if you can accept me, then...

944
00:44:54,069 --> 00:44:56,3
that really is all that matters.

945
00:44:56,056 --> 00:44:58,7
[laughs]

946
00:45:04,041 --> 00:45:07,2
[slow organ music playing]

947
00:45:44,045 --> 00:45:45,3
[inhales deeply]

948
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:58,7
[sobbing quietly]

949
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:05,0
[sobs]

950
00:46:19,002 --> 00:46:21,5
We knew this part would be difficult,
Chloe.

951
00:46:26,065 --> 00:46:28,7
But just remember, what you're doing...

952
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:31,4
is the best thing for everyone on Earth.

953
00:46:33,091 --> 00:46:35,0
Including Lucifer.

954
00:46:40,008 --> 00:46:40,9
I know.

955
00:46:45,063 --> 00:46:47,5
Are you ready for the next step?

956
00:46:49,093 --> 00:46:50,9
[sniffles]

957
00:46:52,051 --> 00:46:53,5
I am.
