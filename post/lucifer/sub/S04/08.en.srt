1
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,6
[thud]

2
00:00:23,018 --> 00:00:24,8
Lucifer. What's going on?

3
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:28,5
You've been avoiding me, Dr. Arn,
so I had to force a meeting.

4
00:00:28,082 --> 00:00:30,3
Yeah, sorry about that.

5
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,7
-Work has been so crazy--
-Don't care.

6
00:00:33,003 --> 00:00:36,8
I granted you a favor.
Now you owe me one. It's time to pay up.

7
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,0
I need a medical consultation.

8
00:00:40,016 --> 00:00:43,9
If I was to tell you I had a mole or two
on my back...

9
00:00:44,033 --> 00:00:48,2
perhaps you could reshape them,
maybe... zhuzh them up a bit?

10
00:00:48,033 --> 00:00:49,9
I'd have to see them first.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,8
[laughs]
Not possible, I'm afraid, but...

12
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,8
I have visual aids.

13
00:00:59,005 --> 00:01:02,0
Wait, you have moles that large
on your back?

14
00:01:02,014 --> 00:01:04,3
You need to get them checked out,
have them removed.

15
00:01:04,039 --> 00:01:06,3
But I tried removing them in the past,

16
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:08,7
but the stubborn buggers
always seem to grow back.

17
00:01:08,086 --> 00:01:11,7
I just need you
to dress them up a smidge.

18
00:01:11,086 --> 00:01:12,9
Maybe you could...

19
00:01:13,007 --> 00:01:15,9
attach some white feathers or tattoo them.

20
00:01:16,003 --> 00:01:16,9
Something cheery,

21
00:01:17,007 --> 00:01:17,9
flowers, maybe.

22
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:19,3
Tattoo your moles?

23
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:22,9
I was thinking maybe I could get you
a discount on some botox, but--

24
00:01:23,008 --> 00:01:25,4
I don't need botox, doctor!

25
00:01:25,054 --> 00:01:28,9
What I need is for you to fix them,
because they are disgusting!

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,6
Please don't hurt me.

27
00:01:30,071 --> 00:01:34,0
-[Amenadiel] Lucifer, what's going on?
-God, I really need to put a lock

28
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:35,0
on that elevator.

29
00:01:36,051 --> 00:01:38,6
Useless, doctor. Get out of my sight.

30
00:01:41,026 --> 00:01:43,2
-Lucy, what were you doing to him?
-Nothing.

31
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,0
Huh?

32
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:49,5
What happened there, brother?
Hit another bridge whilst flying?

33
00:01:50,048 --> 00:01:52,6
That happened one time, Lucy.

34
00:01:52,086 --> 00:01:55,8
And no, I got into a fight with Remy.

35
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:56,9
[pours drink]

36
00:01:56,099 --> 00:01:57,8
Remy was here?

37
00:01:58,086 --> 00:02:00,8
Oh. How is your little clone?

38
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:01,9
Angry.

39
00:02:02,016 --> 00:02:06,8
She wanted to take Linda's baby, my child,
back to the Silver City with her.

40
00:02:07,004 --> 00:02:08,2
The argument escalated.

41
00:02:08,029 --> 00:02:11,7
Of course, I was victorious and now
the child will be raised here on Earth,

42
00:02:11,084 --> 00:02:13,8
which is actually why I'm here.

43
00:02:14,017 --> 00:02:15,4
I have a favor to ask you.

44
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,3
Oh.

45
00:02:17,013 --> 00:02:18,9
Apparently,
there's a tradition here on Earth

46
00:02:19,001 --> 00:02:21,3
to ask someone to be a back-up parent

47
00:02:21,047 --> 00:02:24,3
in case something happens
to the child's real parents.

48
00:02:24,047 --> 00:02:25,3
[Lucifer] Oh.

49
00:02:25,052 --> 00:02:27,3
Are you seriously asking me,

50
00:02:27,043 --> 00:02:30,1
evil incarnate,
to be the child's godfather?

51
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:31,0
Ha!

52
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,2
[bang] The irony.

53
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,6
Well, Lucy, this birth is imminent.

54
00:02:35,036 --> 00:02:38,1
And I still don't know how to be a father.

55
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:39,4
How am I supposed to prepare?

56
00:02:39,053 --> 00:02:42,2
Well, I would have thought it
patently obvious by now.

57
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:44,7
I'm the last person to come to
for fatherly advice.

58
00:02:44,095 --> 00:02:48,5
But if you really want to know
how humans raise their children,

59
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:50,7
maybe you should, I don't know, ask them.

60
00:02:52,025 --> 00:02:54,1
That's actually not bad advice.

61
00:02:54,025 --> 00:02:57,1
And as for being the child's godfather,
trust me, brother,

62
00:02:57,026 --> 00:02:59,6
the biggest favor I can do you
and the child

63
00:02:59,072 --> 00:03:01,7
is to stay as far away as possible.

64
00:03:03,047 --> 00:03:04,5
[sighs]

65
00:03:18,094 --> 00:03:19,8
[Dan] Hey, Ella.

66
00:03:20,032 --> 00:03:22,2
Oh, hey, Dan.

67
00:03:22,095 --> 00:03:23,8
So what's up?

68
00:03:23,095 --> 00:03:25,6
Nothing. Crime scene stuff.

69
00:03:25,074 --> 00:03:26,7
Yeah.

70
00:03:27,058 --> 00:03:28,4
Cool.

71
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:31,2
So, about the other--

72
00:03:31,029 --> 00:03:32,3
Yeah, I wanted to--

73
00:03:32,042 --> 00:03:33,4
-Me too.
-It was--

74
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,9
-Totally--
-But, you know...

75
00:03:35,004 --> 00:03:36,6
-Working together.
-Crossing lines.

76
00:03:36,075 --> 00:03:37,8
Bodies crossing.

77
00:03:37,096 --> 00:03:38,9
Yeah.

78
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,2
Maybe we shouldn't.

79
00:03:41,093 --> 00:03:43,2
No, we shouldn't.

80
00:03:43,076 --> 00:03:45,0
-Cool.
-Cool.

81
00:03:47,001 --> 00:03:51,0
I'm so glad we could talk about this
like adults.

82
00:03:51,035 --> 00:03:52,7
-Yeah, okay.
-Cool.

83
00:03:52,085 --> 00:03:54,6
[bump] Oh, sorry. I'm just...

84
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,1
Okay.

85
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:00,9
[Father Kinley]
When the devil walks the earth

86
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:02,4
and finds his first love...

87
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,7
evil shall be released.

88
00:04:05,028 --> 00:04:08,8
Everything alright, detective?
Did I do something wrong, per usual?

89
00:04:09,004 --> 00:04:11,6
Perhaps I should check myself
into detention whilst I'm here.

90
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,6
Permanently.

91
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,4
No. Everything's fine.

92
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:18,5
[Chloe] Hey, guys.

93
00:04:18,067 --> 00:04:20,6
Oh, hey, Lucifer.

94
00:04:20,084 --> 00:04:24,2
Hey, Dan's ex-wife. Ex-wife.

95
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,6
I mean-- I mean  Chloe.

96
00:04:27,085 --> 00:04:28,8
So what do we have?

97
00:04:30,043 --> 00:04:32,7
-[Ella] This is Sandra Baez...
-[Dan] The victim is-- Yeah.

98
00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:36,5
[both] She was 32 years old...
and a history teacher.

99
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,5
Whatever's happening here
is undoubtedly somehow my fault.

100
00:04:39,065 --> 00:04:41,6
-[Ella] Er...
-Maybe you-- I'm sorry.

101
00:04:42,024 --> 00:04:43,8
Nothing. We're all good.

102
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,5
-We're totally cool.
-All good.

103
00:04:45,066 --> 00:04:49,0
In fact, the janitor,
he's the guy who found the body...

104
00:04:49,058 --> 00:04:51,8
claims that Miss Baez, every morning,
jogs the track,

105
00:04:51,095 --> 00:04:53,7
showers and then she heads to class.

106
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:56,7
[Ella] And apparently someone ambushed her
as she was getting dressed.

107
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,6
And do we have a cause of death?

108
00:04:59,054 --> 00:05:01,9
Cause of death is a blunt force trauma
to the head.

109
00:05:02,005 --> 00:05:05,0
It turns out that Miss Baez
was a faculty adviser.

110
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,1
-Yeah, she was.
-To YEA.

111
00:05:07,068 --> 00:05:11,1
[Ella] Uh, YEA is Youth Academy
of American Entrepreneurs.

112
00:05:11,018 --> 00:05:12,7
The club met last night,

113
00:05:12,085 --> 00:05:15,3
so probably the last people
to see her alive.

114
00:05:15,073 --> 00:05:17,1
[Lucifer] Right, thank you.

115
00:05:17,098 --> 00:05:18,9
[whispers] Lucifer.

116
00:05:20,015 --> 00:05:21,2
Can I talk to you?

117
00:05:22,048 --> 00:05:23,3
Right now.

118
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,1
Sure.

119
00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:29,0
[Chloe] Okay, well...

120
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:31,1
I need to tell you something.

121
00:05:32,024 --> 00:05:34,3
I'm all ears. Or horns, rather.

122
00:05:34,054 --> 00:05:35,9
I went to see Father Kinley.

123
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:39,3
Oh. Did you now?

124
00:05:39,063 --> 00:05:42,8
[laughs] Conjuring up more ways
to send me back to hell, are we?

125
00:05:42,096 --> 00:05:44,2
No. No.

126
00:05:44,034 --> 00:05:48,6
Father Kinley had been asking to see me,
so I finally went and...

127
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,3
he told me about...

128
00:05:53,006 --> 00:05:54,0
a prophecy.

129
00:05:56,018 --> 00:05:57,6
[laughs]

130
00:05:57,069 --> 00:05:58,5
Right.

131
00:05:59,002 --> 00:06:02,6
What is it this time? Are frogs
about to start falling from the sky or...

132
00:06:03,065 --> 00:06:05,4
perhaps winter is coming.

133
00:06:05,049 --> 00:06:09,0
All of this celestial stuff,
it is new to me.

134
00:06:09,016 --> 00:06:11,5
I don't know what is good and bad,

135
00:06:11,062 --> 00:06:12,9
what is real and fake.

136
00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:13,8
But what he said...

137
00:06:15,054 --> 00:06:16,7
It scared me.

138
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,9
Well, come on then, detective.
What did he say?

139
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,0
He said,

140
00:06:20,008 --> 00:06:24,5
"When the devil walks the earth
and finds his first love...

141
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:27,5
evil shall be released."

142
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:29,9
[sighs]

143
00:06:30,034 --> 00:06:32,1
Well, this is wonderful news.

144
00:06:32,018 --> 00:06:35,3
-It sounds kind of bad.
-Oh, it's bad. It's bad, but...

145
00:06:36,056 --> 00:06:38,2
it explains why I'm changing.

146
00:06:38,048 --> 00:06:39,4
Wait up...

147
00:06:39,056 --> 00:06:43,1
listen, if this prophecy
were to actually come true...

148
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:44,8
[breathes shakily]

149
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:47,1
What then? Would there be demons
running around?

150
00:06:47,028 --> 00:06:48,6
Nothing of the sort.

151
00:06:49,007 --> 00:06:50,8
But let's not get bogged down
in specifics,

152
00:06:50,095 --> 00:06:53,7
because none of that will matter
if I can stop the prophecy altogether.

153
00:06:53,087 --> 00:06:55,6
-How?
-Well, clearly the first part,

154
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,5
when the devil walks the earth,
has happened,

155
00:06:57,058 --> 00:06:59,4
because hello, here is me,
walking the earth.

156
00:06:59,075 --> 00:07:02,1
-Yeah.
-And since Eve was my first girlfriend,

157
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:03,0
then she's...

158
00:07:03,017 --> 00:07:04,6
-Your first love.
-Exactly.

159
00:07:04,075 --> 00:07:09,0
So to stop evil being released,
all I need to do is, drum roll, please...

160
00:07:09,088 --> 00:07:11,3
[loudly] Break up with Eve!

161
00:07:14,076 --> 00:07:16,4
So there you have it.

162
00:07:16,097 --> 00:07:20,9
I mean, usually these prophecies
turn out to be gobbledegook, but...

163
00:07:21,064 --> 00:07:23,3
this one seems legit. [sighs]

164
00:07:23,073 --> 00:07:24,7
So...

165
00:07:24,086 --> 00:07:27,4
Wow. [gasps, sighs]

166
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:29,5
I had a feeling...

167
00:07:29,061 --> 00:07:30,5
[panting]

168
00:07:30,065 --> 00:07:32,9
or maybe I just knew all along.

169
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:35,0
-Knew what?
-That you love me!

170
00:07:35,012 --> 00:07:35,9
[laughs]

171
00:07:36,033 --> 00:07:37,9
[laughs]

172
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:40,2
Right. And how exactly
did you end up there?

173
00:07:40,066 --> 00:07:42,5
The prophecy, silly.

174
00:07:42,058 --> 00:07:48,3
I mean, if you believe it to be true
then, "When the devil walks the earth

175
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:53,2
and meets his first love,"
means you consider me to be your...

176
00:07:53,076 --> 00:07:54,6
first love.

177
00:07:55,064 --> 00:07:56,6
Ergo!

178
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:59,8
-You love me.
-Mm...

179
00:07:59,097 --> 00:08:01,0
[Eve murmurs]

180
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:04,2
[Eve] Oh, my God!
I can't believe you said it first.

181
00:08:04,035 --> 00:08:06,2
I've been dying to say it for so long.

182
00:08:06,036 --> 00:08:07,4
[Lucifer] Have you?

183
00:08:07,048 --> 00:08:10,4
Interesting you should focus
on that part of the prophecy,

184
00:08:10,053 --> 00:08:13,6
when evil being released really is the...

185
00:08:14,028 --> 00:08:15,9
-the relevant part.
-[Eve laughs]

186
00:08:16,007 --> 00:08:18,6
[Lucifer laughing]
And much as I hate to say this,

187
00:08:18,074 --> 00:08:20,5
I think it means that we need to...

188
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,0
you know...

189
00:08:23,062 --> 00:08:24,8
break up.

190
00:08:27,034 --> 00:08:28,1
No.

191
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,9
-No?
-Mm-mm.

192
00:08:30,055 --> 00:08:33,5
Lucifer, I know what you're doing.

193
00:08:33,063 --> 00:08:34,8
-Do you?
-Yes.

194
00:08:34,093 --> 00:08:38,0
You're scared.
Because you've been hurt before.

195
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,8
You don't have to worry, okay?

196
00:08:40,093 --> 00:08:44,7
I promise you that I will never,
ever, ever...

197
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,6
give up on you.

198
00:08:47,052 --> 00:08:48,4
You know why?

199
00:08:49,036 --> 00:08:50,3
Surprise me.

200
00:08:52,028 --> 00:08:53,7
Because I love you too.

201
00:08:57,011 --> 00:08:57,9
Ah...

202
00:08:58,062 --> 00:08:59,4
Boop!

203
00:08:59,058 --> 00:09:02,7
[laughs, squeals]

204
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,0
[footsteps departing]

205
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:05,0
[sighs]

206
00:09:05,016 --> 00:09:06,2
Shit.

207
00:09:18,055 --> 00:09:20,3
[Chloe] Thanks for speaking with us,
Miss Shaw.

208
00:09:20,043 --> 00:09:22,2
[lady] Please, call me Lexy.

209
00:09:22,043 --> 00:09:24,4
Anything to help find the person
who did this.

210
00:09:24,052 --> 00:09:26,2
We're speaking to everybody
in the YEA club,

211
00:09:26,031 --> 00:09:29,1
because you all were the last to see
Miss Baez last night.

212
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:32,0
Did you notice anything
out of the ordinary with her?

213
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:34,5
No. She was her normal, cheery self.

214
00:09:35,015 --> 00:09:38,1
Miss Baez was awesome.
She did so much for me.

215
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:43,0
She was also the SAT prep administrator,
so helped me get into my first choice.

216
00:09:44,012 --> 00:09:45,2
It was Harvard.

217
00:09:46,004 --> 00:09:48,1
-Oh.
-She's also just so good at giving advice

218
00:09:48,025 --> 00:09:49,0
on anything.

219
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:52,1
School, parents, relationships.

220
00:09:52,021 --> 00:09:53,5
Relationships?

221
00:09:54,005 --> 00:09:57,7
What advice would Miss Baez give
to, say, a student in a relationship

222
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,5
who, I don't know,
needed to break up with someone?

223
00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:04,6
Oh, well, I wouldn't know.
My boyfriend and I are super-solid.

224
00:10:04,072 --> 00:10:06,1
We'll probably get married.

225
00:10:06,018 --> 00:10:08,3
After we both finish college. At Harvard.

226
00:10:08,077 --> 00:10:09,6
Right.

227
00:10:10,056 --> 00:10:13,4
Do you know of anyone
who may want to hurt Miss Baez?

228
00:10:13,048 --> 00:10:15,6
[Lexy] Not really. Well, unless...

229
00:10:15,074 --> 00:10:17,4
Have you spoken to Caleb Mayfield?

230
00:10:17,061 --> 00:10:19,1
No. Why?

231
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:22,7
Miss Baez was particularly talented
at giving advice to the more...

232
00:10:23,066 --> 00:10:25,5
troubled students.

233
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,8
Ah.

234
00:10:27,012 --> 00:10:30,6
Nah, I didn't really know Miss Baez
that well.

235
00:10:30,071 --> 00:10:33,3
To be honest, I was thinking
about quitting YEA altogether.

236
00:10:33,046 --> 00:10:35,3
You were going to break up
with the entire club.

237
00:10:35,042 --> 00:10:38,1
How does one specifically
say nay to YEA?

238
00:10:38,072 --> 00:10:40,5
Could we just stay focused, Lucifer?

239
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:44,1
Lucifer?
As in the club owner who grants favors?

240
00:10:44,022 --> 00:10:45,8
You've heard of the favors?

241
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:48,8
Some people I hang around with,
they may have mentioned it.

242
00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:51,8
Well, granting favors is much lower
on my resume these days

243
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:54,4
than releasing death and destruction
upon the world.

244
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:57,5
So you didn't spend much time
with Miss Baez?

245
00:10:57,061 --> 00:10:58,5
Not really.

246
00:10:59,036 --> 00:11:02,4
Did you guys talk to Nate Benedict?
He was fighting with her.

247
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,0
Mm.

248
00:11:04,045 --> 00:11:06,6
[Nate] We had, you know, words.

249
00:11:06,074 --> 00:11:08,2
What were you fighting about?

250
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:10,8
I was pissed
because she was sleeping with my dad.

251
00:11:10,096 --> 00:11:13,1
Miss Baez was having an affair
with your father?

252
00:11:13,025 --> 00:11:16,2
My parents are separated,
and they totally could have fixed things,

253
00:11:16,034 --> 00:11:19,5
but Miss Baez was standing in the way,
so hells yeah, I was angry.

254
00:11:19,067 --> 00:11:22,1
-I see.
-But not enough so I'd kill her.

255
00:11:22,043 --> 00:11:24,3
And where were you yesterday morning?

256
00:11:24,047 --> 00:11:25,9
At my girlfriend Lexy's place.

257
00:11:26,006 --> 00:11:28,0
My dad said he had things
he needed to take care of,

258
00:11:28,014 --> 00:11:29,2
He needed me out all night.

259
00:11:29,031 --> 00:11:32,1
We'll have to speak with your dad
to confirm your story.

260
00:11:32,044 --> 00:11:33,7
And his. Thank you.

261
00:11:34,077 --> 00:11:35,6
Oh...

262
00:11:36,011 --> 00:11:37,7
Your parents' marriage failed.

263
00:11:37,082 --> 00:11:41,1
What exactly was the final nail
in the coffin of their relationship?

264
00:11:41,057 --> 00:11:45,0
Weirdly enough, things got really bad
after they went to couple's therapy.

265
00:11:45,016 --> 00:11:45,9
Therapy.

266
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,7
Of course.

267
00:11:51,012 --> 00:11:55,2
[club music playing in background]

268
00:11:57,092 --> 00:11:59,8
Excuse me. Do you have any children?

269
00:12:01,034 --> 00:12:03,4
Why? Did Ramona send you?

270
00:12:03,072 --> 00:12:05,6
Hey, man, I'm all paid up
on my child support.

271
00:12:14,015 --> 00:12:17,5
Excuse me. Do you have a good relationship
with your father?

272
00:12:17,086 --> 00:12:18,7
[laughs]

273
00:12:18,094 --> 00:12:20,9
I love all my daddies.

274
00:12:23,086 --> 00:12:24,9
Right.

275
00:12:29,016 --> 00:12:30,1
Excuse me!

276
00:12:31,054 --> 00:12:33,7
Do you have a good relationship
with your father?

277
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:36,7
I'm dancing half naked in a nightclub
for money.

278
00:12:37,038 --> 00:12:38,4
What do you think?

279
00:12:44,076 --> 00:12:45,7
Hey...

280
00:12:46,043 --> 00:12:49,0
do you know where I could find
Lucifer Morningstar?

281
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,1
He's not here right now.

282
00:12:50,026 --> 00:12:52,1
-Damn.
-What do you need from Lucifer?

283
00:12:52,027 --> 00:12:53,1
Just...

284
00:12:54,019 --> 00:12:56,4
-a favor. Thanks.
-Whoa, hold up.

285
00:12:56,048 --> 00:12:59,4
Maybe I can help.
I'm Amenadiel, Lucifer's brother.

286
00:12:59,052 --> 00:13:01,8
-For real?
-As God is my witness.

287
00:13:02,003 --> 00:13:02,9
I'm Caleb.

288
00:13:03,024 --> 00:13:04,9
So what's the problem, Caleb?

289
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,6
This.

290
00:13:09,053 --> 00:13:10,6
Xanax and Adderall.

291
00:13:11,016 --> 00:13:13,6
-Where did you get all these drugs from?
-A dealer.

292
00:13:14,016 --> 00:13:15,2
His name's Tahir.

293
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:17,7
He asked me to sell it at school.
I did once.

294
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:19,5
I'm just trying not to do it no more.

295
00:13:19,088 --> 00:13:22,5
Problem is, he said if I don't,
he'll mess me up bad.

296
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:24,9
I was hoping
maybe Lucifer could buy them off me.

297
00:13:25,001 --> 00:13:27,5
Just take them off my hands. Could you?

298
00:13:27,068 --> 00:13:30,5
Listen, even if I did,
that wouldn't solve your problem.

299
00:13:31,064 --> 00:13:34,9
It sounds like this Tahir would just,
you know, make you sell more.

300
00:13:35,006 --> 00:13:36,4
What am I supposed to do?

301
00:13:37,031 --> 00:13:38,4
I just want out.

302
00:13:42,044 --> 00:13:44,0
Hey, Ella, you wanted to see me?

303
00:13:44,015 --> 00:13:46,5
Yes, Sandra Baez's autopsy report
just came in.

304
00:13:46,061 --> 00:13:49,0
Great. I'll go and get Dan
and we can go over it together.

305
00:13:49,016 --> 00:13:53,0
No! Don't. I'll just tell you what it says
and then you can tell Dan.

306
00:13:53,012 --> 00:13:55,4
Because, you know,
you probably see him all the time,

307
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:57,4
like when you're handing off Trixie,

308
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:01,3
the child you made together
when you were married together.

309
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:02,9
Okay.

310
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:06,3
So... what does it say?

311
00:14:06,047 --> 00:14:07,5
Contusions.

312
00:14:07,063 --> 00:14:10,1
Two of them on the victim's skull.

313
00:14:10,034 --> 00:14:14,4
Unusually shaped, so it appears
that the murder weapon is a golf club.

314
00:14:14,068 --> 00:14:16,1
A driver, to be exact.

315
00:14:16,018 --> 00:14:19,4
Got it. I'll tell Dan that we need
a search warrant for the golf lockers.

316
00:14:19,048 --> 00:14:20,3
Good.

317
00:14:20,048 --> 00:14:22,7
[phone rings]

318
00:14:24,015 --> 00:14:25,0
Forensics.

319
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:27,9
Yeah, I worked the Tiernan case.

320
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:33,7
I'm sorry, where did you say
you were calling from?

321
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:38,7
["Wild Jungle" by Thurz playing]

322
00:14:42,046 --> 00:14:44,4
So how do you like being a prison guard?

323
00:14:45,013 --> 00:14:48,7
Boring. Unless you get to mix it up,
you know, fight with an inmate.

324
00:14:49,051 --> 00:14:50,8
How's bounty hunting?

325
00:14:51,064 --> 00:14:53,5
Look, I'm going to get to the point.

326
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,3
Usually I go straight for the sex,

327
00:14:55,068 --> 00:14:58,3
but my friend thinks
I'm too invested in her baby...

328
00:14:58,048 --> 00:15:00,9
thinks I need to find a connection
of my own, so...

329
00:15:01,048 --> 00:15:03,4
I'm looking for someone
I can do that with.

330
00:15:04,077 --> 00:15:06,4
Whatever. I'm in.

331
00:15:09,011 --> 00:15:11,4
You're too clingy.
This is never going to work.

332
00:15:20,033 --> 00:15:22,3
I recently learned, doctor,

333
00:15:22,042 --> 00:15:26,5
that counseling is a good way
to help relationships grow, evolve

334
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:29,0
and then reach their final destination.

335
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:32,0
[Linda] Yes, it can be.

336
00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:34,9
In the right circumstance.

337
00:15:35,014 --> 00:15:39,1
Linda, I'm so happy to finally meet you.

338
00:15:39,056 --> 00:15:41,9
And being here in this room...

339
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:46,6
Woo! It's kind of like
being inside Lucifer's mind.

340
00:15:46,077 --> 00:15:48,1
[both laugh]

341
00:15:48,023 --> 00:15:49,2
Scary thought.

342
00:15:49,044 --> 00:15:50,5
Ha-ha!

343
00:15:50,061 --> 00:15:54,7
Yes, well,
I'm very happy to meet you too, Eve.

344
00:15:55,028 --> 00:15:56,1
[laughs]

345
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:59,0
Wow. You're the first woman ever.

346
00:15:59,016 --> 00:16:00,9
It's like meeting a dinosaur.

347
00:16:01,004 --> 00:16:03,2
-[gasps]
-[Linda] Not that you look old.

348
00:16:03,037 --> 00:16:05,9
I mean, it's like you're my great-great,

349
00:16:06,021 --> 00:16:07,7
great-great...

350
00:16:07,084 --> 00:16:08,6
whatever.

351
00:16:08,088 --> 00:16:10,3
Ah! Never mind.

352
00:16:10,038 --> 00:16:12,6
-[laughs]
-What can I do for you guys?

353
00:16:13,068 --> 00:16:16,5
I think, if you looked up
"perfect relationship" in the dictionary,

354
00:16:16,064 --> 00:16:18,9
you might just see a photo
of myself and Eve.

355
00:16:19,035 --> 00:16:20,4
-[Eve] Mm!
-[chuckles]

356
00:16:20,056 --> 00:16:24,6
But complacency is the enemy
of excellence, so I thought it wise

357
00:16:24,077 --> 00:16:28,4
to get your expert perspective
on our wonderful kinship.

358
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,3
I'm guessing this isn't going to end well.

359
00:16:31,044 --> 00:16:34,1
[both laugh]

360
00:16:34,024 --> 00:16:37,6
[Linda] Please, tell me about this
wonderful relationship of yours.

361
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:40,9
Well, I'd say that we are impulsive.

362
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:44,7
I mean, we often text whilst driving.
We moved in together after one day.

363
00:16:45,058 --> 00:16:48,8
Also we consume an unfathomable amount
of drugs and alcohol

364
00:16:48,092 --> 00:16:52,3
and regularly invite strangers
into our bedroom.

365
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,7
It's true.

366
00:16:53,084 --> 00:16:56,8
Did I mention that Eve has just come out
of a long-term relationship?

367
00:16:56,093 --> 00:16:58,7
[Lucifer] So, what say you, doctor?

368
00:16:58,085 --> 00:17:00,2
Hm. Yes, well...

369
00:17:00,076 --> 00:17:03,0
while you claim to be happy,

370
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:05,5
I'm sensing a hidden trepidation

371
00:17:06,002 --> 00:17:08,7
by the words that you're using
to describe your relationship.

372
00:17:08,081 --> 00:17:10,8
In fact, I'm concerned

373
00:17:10,094 --> 00:17:13,3
that you're returning
to a familiar pattern of...

374
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:14,6
Denial.

375
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:18,7
That's exactly what I was going to say.

376
00:17:18,082 --> 00:17:20,0
[Eve] Don't you just hate it

377
00:17:20,012 --> 00:17:24,3
when he takes the exact wrong message
from every single conversation?

378
00:17:24,046 --> 00:17:25,5
Oh, my God!

379
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:29,3
Every single time! [laughs]

380
00:17:29,042 --> 00:17:32,7
-Right. Why don't we get back on track?
-How have we not met?

381
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:35,3
-[Eve] I don't know!
-Right, there's a prophecy.

382
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:37,0
[Eve] Now he's just deflecting.

383
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:39,7
I couldn't have said it better myself.
[laughs]

384
00:17:40,014 --> 00:17:44,4
You know, Lucifer has a tendency to
project his issues onto external sources

385
00:17:44,068 --> 00:17:46,0
when what he really needs to do

386
00:17:46,014 --> 00:17:47,9
-is face his issues head on.
-Head on.

387
00:17:48,019 --> 00:17:49,0
Finally!

388
00:17:49,081 --> 00:17:51,3
[both laugh]

389
00:17:56,024 --> 00:17:58,4
-[dog barks]
-[siren wails]

390
00:17:59,032 --> 00:18:01,2
[Caleb]
You sure you know what you're doing?

391
00:18:01,066 --> 00:18:04,2
Caleb,
I'm the Silver City's greatest warrior.

392
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:06,5
There's no need to worry. Ha!

393
00:18:07,054 --> 00:18:08,5
Tell me something.

394
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:11,9
How did you get involved in this business
in the first place?

395
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,7
I met Tahir and his boys at a club.

396
00:18:15,005 --> 00:18:17,2
He seemed cool,
so I start hanging with them.

397
00:18:17,034 --> 00:18:21,5
Then one day, Tahir offered me
a way to make some extra cash.

398
00:18:21,076 --> 00:18:23,1
Why didn't you just say no?

399
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,4
Tahir's not really the kind of guy
you say no to.

400
00:18:25,056 --> 00:18:28,0
I'm pretty sure
I can reason with this Tahir...

401
00:18:28,056 --> 00:18:30,2
convince him to let you off the hook.

402
00:18:30,085 --> 00:18:32,8
And then maybe, after...

403
00:18:33,082 --> 00:18:36,0
we can go and get some ice cream together.

404
00:18:36,094 --> 00:18:37,9
[dog barks]

405
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,9
[Tahir] Ha! My man, Caleb.

406
00:18:43,074 --> 00:18:44,9
What's good, man?

407
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,6
Oh, you need bodyguards now?

408
00:18:48,012 --> 00:18:51,7
What's wrong? The white kids at school
loving them beans a little bit too much?

409
00:18:52,033 --> 00:18:54,9
Actually, Caleb won't be selling
them beans anymore.

410
00:18:55,055 --> 00:19:00,0
You see, he no longer wishes to be a part
of your illegal drug operation.

411
00:19:04,014 --> 00:19:05,1
[sighs]

412
00:19:07,056 --> 00:19:09,0
-[thud]
-[crack]

413
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,5
[groans in pain]

414
00:19:10,077 --> 00:19:12,5
-[Caleb] Oh...
-Excuse me.

415
00:19:16,057 --> 00:19:17,4
Caleb is out.

416
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:19,8
His obligation is done.

417
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:21,9
This dude right here means business.

418
00:19:22,057 --> 00:19:23,9
But it don't work like that.

419
00:19:24,007 --> 00:19:26,6
You see, I've got expenses,
and he needs to pay me out,

420
00:19:26,095 --> 00:19:28,2
one way or another.

421
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:31,4
Alright, fine. I'll be the one
to come back and pay for those drugs.

422
00:19:31,054 --> 00:19:32,6
Uh-oh, hold on, man.

423
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:34,2
The honor code's broken right now.

424
00:19:34,029 --> 00:19:36,4
You'll have to leave me
some kind of collateral.

425
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:39,3
-What about the kid?
-That's never going to happen, Tahir.

426
00:19:40,063 --> 00:19:42,5
What about that bling around your neck?

427
00:19:43,055 --> 00:19:47,6
This bling is a gift from my father,
Tahir. It's priceless.

428
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:48,8
[Tahir] That's good.

429
00:19:49,031 --> 00:19:52,5
That means you'll be highly motivated
to come back with my money.

430
00:20:04,045 --> 00:20:06,0
I will be coming back for that.

431
00:20:10,054 --> 00:20:11,7
[Tahir] Know this, Caleb.

432
00:20:11,087 --> 00:20:14,6
If anything blow back on me,
I blow back on y'all.

433
00:20:15,058 --> 00:20:16,5
You feel me?

434
00:20:17,067 --> 00:20:19,8
[Amenadiel sniffs, laughs]

435
00:20:21,001 --> 00:20:22,4
[man] I can't believe she's gone.

436
00:20:22,063 --> 00:20:24,9
Miss Baez was a great mentor to Nate.

437
00:20:25,001 --> 00:20:28,5
Nate said that you asked him
to be out of the house last night.

438
00:20:28,064 --> 00:20:31,2
-What was it you needed to take care of?
-Work stuff.

439
00:20:31,043 --> 00:20:32,3
[Lucifer] Work stuff?

440
00:20:32,052 --> 00:20:34,1
Like murdering a beloved teacher?

441
00:20:34,044 --> 00:20:36,4
You think I killed her? That's insane.

442
00:20:36,061 --> 00:20:37,4
[Chloe] Is it?

443
00:20:37,052 --> 00:20:38,7
You were sleeping with her.

444
00:20:38,082 --> 00:20:41,9
Yes, we were having an affair,
but that's over. Broke off last week.

445
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:44,7
You didn't have to kill her
to break up with her, did you?

446
00:20:44,082 --> 00:20:45,8
Of course not!

447
00:20:45,091 --> 00:20:48,3
-Oh.
-It was mutual. In fact, I already...

448
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,9
started seeing somebody else.

449
00:20:50,004 --> 00:20:52,6
So you were having an affair
on your affair?

450
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:56,2
Not exactly. I started seeing my ex, Emma.
We had gone to counseling.

451
00:20:56,033 --> 00:20:59,1
It was rough at first, but ultimately
it helped bring us back together.

452
00:20:59,021 --> 00:21:00,1
Now you tell me!

453
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,0
Last night I was with Emma.

454
00:21:02,017 --> 00:21:04,6
We didn't want to tell Nate,
we didn't want to mess with his head.

455
00:21:04,076 --> 00:21:07,6
He had taken our break-up really hard,
but he's doing so great lately.

456
00:21:07,076 --> 00:21:09,2
He's seeing Lexy, great girl.

457
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:11,6
Crushed his SATs, he got into Harvard.

458
00:21:11,072 --> 00:21:13,6
We didn't want to rattle him until...

459
00:21:14,014 --> 00:21:15,6
we knew it was permanent.

460
00:21:15,069 --> 00:21:18,1
[Chloe]
I'll need your ex-wife's information.

461
00:21:18,023 --> 00:21:22,1
Er... why did you and your wife break up
in the first place?

462
00:21:23,061 --> 00:21:26,7
[sighs]
I suppose I was the cliché bad husband.

463
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,9
Infidelity, selfishness, neglect.

464
00:21:30,049 --> 00:21:33,5
In hindsight, I gave Emma no option
but to break up with me.

465
00:21:35,037 --> 00:21:38,3
[Lucifer] Cliché bad husband, I see.

466
00:21:42,046 --> 00:21:43,5
[elevator bell rings]

467
00:21:44,026 --> 00:21:49,5
[cheers, laughs and whoops]

468
00:21:49,093 --> 00:21:51,3
[guy] You're going to get it!

469
00:21:51,047 --> 00:21:52,4
[Eve] Er, babe?

470
00:21:52,056 --> 00:21:55,1
I thought we had plans.

471
00:21:55,027 --> 00:21:56,8
Nah, sorry...

472
00:21:57,019 --> 00:21:58,6
right, Lynn, you're up next!

473
00:21:59,031 --> 00:22:00,7

[sound of football on television]

476
00:22:32,097 --> 00:22:35,8
Move! Move! Ah! Aha!

477
00:22:36,077 --> 00:22:37,8
[roars]

478
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:43,9
[Eve screams]

479
00:22:44,019 --> 00:22:46,0
Yes! Yes!

480
00:22:46,015 --> 00:22:48,4
Suck it! Suck it!

481
00:23:10,063 --> 00:23:13,0
[Eve] Yes! That's what I'm talking about.

482
00:23:13,014 --> 00:23:15,2
[both laughing]

483
00:23:15,035 --> 00:23:17,5
[sounds of revelry]

00:23:17,064 --> 00:23:18,4
[phone buzzes]

485
00:23:18,056 --> 00:23:21,8
In your face! Ah!

486
00:23:22,015 --> 00:23:23,1
-Yes!
-[can crackles]

487
00:23:23,031 --> 00:23:24,7
Detective. How can I help?

488
00:23:25,027 --> 00:23:28,1
[Chloe] We know who the killer is.
Meet me at the precinct.

489
00:23:28,036 --> 00:23:29,1
Right.

490
00:23:29,095 --> 00:23:31,5
Erm... Eve!

491
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:33,5
I have to go.

492
00:23:33,062 --> 00:23:36,3
Hey, are you sure you can't stay
a little longer?

493
00:23:36,045 --> 00:23:37,6
We have queso!

494
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,3
[sighs] It's work.

495
00:23:40,004 --> 00:23:40,9
[sighs]

496
00:23:43,096 --> 00:23:46,0
[Caleb]
Yo, did you see the look on their face

497
00:23:46,017 --> 00:23:48,7
when you busted up homeboy's hand?
[laughs]

498
00:23:48,088 --> 00:23:50,9
I told you I've got skills, young buck.

499
00:23:51,005 --> 00:23:53,3
Not bad. I'll never doubt you again.

500
00:23:54,026 --> 00:23:55,8
See, I knew that you were smart.

501
00:23:55,097 --> 00:23:57,6
Which does make me wonder, Caleb,

502
00:23:57,072 --> 00:24:00,0
why would you even want to be friends
with those guys?

503
00:24:00,014 --> 00:24:02,7
I mean, you must have lots of friends
back at school.

504
00:24:02,085 --> 00:24:05,8
Yeah, but I don't really fit in
with the rich, white crowd.

505
00:24:05,094 --> 00:24:08,4
Tahir and his boys, they look like me.

506
00:24:09,007 --> 00:24:10,4
They let me be me.

507
00:24:10,053 --> 00:24:13,3
I mean, if I knew what they was into
in the beginning,

508
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:15,7
maybe I would have found
a new crew to hang with.

509
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:18,7
It's just kind of hard
finding your own kind.

510
00:24:19,058 --> 00:24:20,9
Your own people, you know?

511
00:24:22,096 --> 00:24:24,3
I've got a question for you.

512
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,4
Why are you even helping me?

513
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,5
I, erm...

514
00:24:29,096 --> 00:24:30,8
[snort]

515
00:24:31,001 --> 00:24:32,4
I have a son on the way.

516
00:24:34,026 --> 00:24:35,0
Yeah.

517
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:39,8
And I've been worried
if I'm going to be a good father.

518
00:24:40,097 --> 00:24:43,2
So, what? I'm like a test run for you?

519
00:24:46,065 --> 00:24:47,9
[Caleb laughs]

520
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:50,2
I was just playing, man.

521
00:24:51,015 --> 00:24:52,0
I'm cool with it.

522
00:24:53,003 --> 00:24:54,4
[police siren wails]

523
00:24:58,053 --> 00:24:59,9
Are you Caleb Mayfield?

524
00:25:01,012 --> 00:25:04,2
-I said are you Caleb Mayfield?
-Yes, this is Caleb, officer.

525
00:25:05,017 --> 00:25:07,7
-What's the problem?
-We've got a warrant out for his arrest.

526
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:09,7
-He's wanted for murder.
-Murder?

527
00:25:11,071 --> 00:25:13,7
No. No, that can't be right.

528
00:25:13,084 --> 00:25:15,3
Down on the ground, hands on your head.

529
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,4
Listen, punk, I said down on the ground,

530
00:25:17,055 --> 00:25:18,7
-[crash]
-hands on your head.

531
00:25:18,085 --> 00:25:20,1
[Amenadiel] You're hurting him!

532
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:23,3
-Sir, stop right there, put your hands up.
-Put my hands, wh--

533
00:25:24,014 --> 00:25:27,6
Why are you pointing your gun at me?
I've done absolutely nothing wrong.

534
00:25:27,069 --> 00:25:29,5
Put your hands on your head now!

535
00:25:29,061 --> 00:25:31,3
[Caleb groans, coughs]

536
00:25:31,053 --> 00:25:32,6
[handcuffs rattle]

537
00:25:32,073 --> 00:25:35,5
Look, you guys are making
a big mistake here, alright?

538
00:25:35,065 --> 00:25:38,9
Now I have friends in the LAPD.
Just let me call them.

539
00:25:39,007 --> 00:25:41,3
-No, no, please just do what they say!
-You're hurting him!

540
00:25:41,045 --> 00:25:43,2
-Put your hands on your head!
-Get off of him!

541
00:25:43,045 --> 00:25:46,2
I'll tell you one last time, asshole.
Put your hands up!

542
00:25:46,029 --> 00:25:48,9
-I'm not putting my hands above my head!
-Don't make me shoot you.

543
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,3
I don't want to shoot you!

544
00:25:50,042 --> 00:25:53,4
Stand down! He's my friend!
He's a friend.

545
00:26:00,085 --> 00:26:01,6
Are you okay?

546
00:26:08,031 --> 00:26:09,4
[phone rings]

547
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:13,5
[Dan sighs] A golf club...

548
00:26:14,053 --> 00:26:18,6
with Caleb's prints and the victim's blood
was found in his locker.

549
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:21,3
Caleb was known to sell drugs,

550
00:26:21,058 --> 00:26:24,5
so the working theory
is that Miss Baez found out,

551
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:26,5
threatened to turn him in,
so he killed her.

552
00:26:26,066 --> 00:26:27,7
No, Dan.

553
00:26:27,096 --> 00:26:29,3
Caleb is not a killer.

554
00:26:29,058 --> 00:26:31,4
Okay. But the kid looks guilty.

555
00:26:31,092 --> 00:26:34,2
What exactly does "looks guilty"
even mean, Dan?

556
00:26:34,034 --> 00:26:36,2
Are you talking about the color
of his skin?

557
00:26:37,042 --> 00:26:38,8
He's guilty given all the...

558
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:41,9
evidence against him, man.
Come on, how dare you?

559
00:26:46,018 --> 00:26:47,1
[sighs]

560
00:26:48,085 --> 00:26:50,0
Are you okay?

561
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:52,3
I know it's not fun to have guns...

562
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:53,9
pointed at you.

563
00:26:54,007 --> 00:26:55,7
Why wouldn't those officers listen to me?

564
00:26:55,082 --> 00:26:58,1
I tried to talk to them, reason with them,
but they...

565
00:26:58,099 --> 00:27:00,1
They wouldn't listen.

566
00:27:01,016 --> 00:27:03,1
It's like they'd already made up
their minds.

567
00:27:03,024 --> 00:27:05,5
Those two cowboy hotheads
are way out of line

568
00:27:05,066 --> 00:27:07,6
I'm filing an excessive force
complaint against them

569
00:27:07,075 --> 00:27:09,1
as soon as all this is over.

570
00:27:09,025 --> 00:27:10,7
And what changes will come...

571
00:27:11,021 --> 00:27:14,0
as a result of your complaint?

572
00:27:16,005 --> 00:27:17,3
Probably nothing.

573
00:27:18,088 --> 00:27:20,3
[Ella] Hey, Dan...

574
00:27:21,034 --> 00:27:23,0
can I talk to you for a second?

575
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:32,0
Okay.

576
00:27:32,056 --> 00:27:36,3
I'm not really sure how to say this, but--

577
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,6
Hold on a second.

578
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:41,5
I thought that we were on the same page
about us.

579
00:27:41,066 --> 00:27:43,3
This is about the Tiernan case.

580
00:27:43,045 --> 00:27:45,6
Right. I'm sorry. What about it?

581
00:27:45,087 --> 00:27:48,3
To close the case,
due diligence interviews were done

582
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,5
by the detective pool.

583
00:27:49,062 --> 00:27:52,0
Someone told them
that it might've been a cop...

584
00:27:53,008 --> 00:27:54,4
who came to Jacob Tiernan

585
00:27:54,054 --> 00:27:57,8
and told him that it was Lucifer himself
who broke his son's back.

586
00:27:57,096 --> 00:27:59,2
It's an outrageous claim.

587
00:27:59,046 --> 00:28:01,8
I know! But what if it's true?

588
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:03,9
Someone might have it out for Lucifer.

589
00:28:04,022 --> 00:28:05,4
I guess it's possible.

590
00:28:05,055 --> 00:28:07,9
I could narrow down which cop it could be

591
00:28:08,001 --> 00:28:10,3
by tracking the department cars,
but I don't know what to do,

592
00:28:10,043 --> 00:28:11,9
whether to tell Chloe or not--

593
00:28:13,035 --> 00:28:15,0
Whoa, Dan!

594
00:28:15,056 --> 00:28:16,6
What are you doing?

595
00:28:16,098 --> 00:28:18,6
I'm flattered, but I just...

596
00:28:18,073 --> 00:28:21,5
You're right, we need to be
on the same page here,

597
00:28:21,065 --> 00:28:25,3
which is that this is no bueno.

598
00:28:25,041 --> 00:28:27,1
I got caught up in the moment.

599
00:28:28,045 --> 00:28:29,5
It won't happen again.

600
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,8
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

601
00:28:31,091 --> 00:28:34,8
And the Tiernan thing, sounds like
it's way out of left field to me.

602
00:28:34,096 --> 00:28:37,7
Yeah. Yeah, you're right. Er...

603
00:28:38,021 --> 00:28:40,3
Okay. Anyway, er...

604
00:28:40,067 --> 00:28:41,5
Later.

605
00:28:42,009 --> 00:28:42,9
Later.

606
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,0
[door closes]

607
00:28:46,089 --> 00:28:49,1
[sighs]

608
00:28:49,026 --> 00:28:50,1
[bang]

609
00:28:50,089 --> 00:28:52,2
[door rattles]

610
00:28:54,002 --> 00:28:54,9
[door bangs]

611
00:28:57,077 --> 00:28:58,7
[door bangs]

612
00:29:08,053 --> 00:29:10,4
So listen, I talked to your parents.

613
00:29:11,024 --> 00:29:12,7
They're flying back from vacation.

614
00:29:12,091 --> 00:29:14,7
We're going to get you a good lawyer,

615
00:29:14,096 --> 00:29:17,2
clear your name
and you'll be out of here soon.

616
00:29:19,029 --> 00:29:21,5
Let me ask you something.
What makes you sure

617
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:23,5
-I didn't kill that teacher?
-I know you wouldn't.

618
00:29:23,059 --> 00:29:26,0
You figured all that out by knowing me
for one whole day?

619
00:29:26,018 --> 00:29:29,1
Yes. I know you wouldn't murder anyone,
Caleb.

620
00:29:29,022 --> 00:29:32,1
But that doesn't matter.
So who cares if you believe me?

621
00:29:32,018 --> 00:29:33,3
The cops don't.

622
00:29:33,043 --> 00:29:34,6
But you're innocent.

623
00:29:34,068 --> 00:29:37,8
The truth will come out and they'll have
no choice but to set you free--

624
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:41,1
What kind of bullshit, fantasy world
do you be living in, man?

625
00:29:41,036 --> 00:29:42,9
I mean, look what happened to you.

626
00:29:43,003 --> 00:29:45,7
You didn't even do anything
and you almost got shot.

627
00:29:45,086 --> 00:29:48,7
The only truth that matters is theirs.

628
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:52,2
And to them, I am a black kid
who is selling drugs,

629
00:29:52,029 --> 00:29:55,0
whose fingerprints were found
on the murder weapon.

630
00:29:56,033 --> 00:29:58,1
My life is over.

631
00:29:58,063 --> 00:30:01,0
Just go. Stop wasting your time on me.

632
00:30:02,042 --> 00:30:04,0
I'm not leaving you, Caleb.

633
00:30:04,034 --> 00:30:07,8
Now, there are good people out there
who can find out the real truth,

634
00:30:07,088 --> 00:30:09,3
but they're gonna need your help.

635
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,9
And I'm not asking you
to have faith in them. Have faith in me.

636
00:30:16,068 --> 00:30:17,6
Okay?

637
00:30:30,053 --> 00:30:32,6
[guy] This is an interesting pair-up, huh?

638
00:30:32,095 --> 00:30:34,1
Loved your profile.

639
00:30:34,095 --> 00:30:38,1
And all those stories you made up
about murderous exploits...

640
00:30:38,058 --> 00:30:40,3
Wow! [laughs]

641
00:30:40,042 --> 00:30:43,1
Ah. Consider me turned on.

642
00:30:44,063 --> 00:30:45,9
[both laugh uncomfortably]

643
00:30:46,034 --> 00:30:47,1
But...

644
00:30:47,076 --> 00:30:49,3
I don't see this working out.

645
00:30:50,055 --> 00:30:53,1
I mean, we're both clearly Alphas.

646
00:30:53,072 --> 00:30:56,6
We'd just wind up butting heads
and locking horns.

647
00:30:57,027 --> 00:30:59,0
I just don't see a future together.

648
00:31:02,002 --> 00:31:04,8
But have a lovely evening
and good luck, milady.

649
00:31:05,048 --> 00:31:06,4
Mm-hm.

650
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:09,9
Argh!

651
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,8
[Eve] Oh, hey, Maze.

652
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:17,1
Have you seen Lucifer?

653
00:31:17,025 --> 00:31:18,0
No.

654
00:31:19,046 --> 00:31:20,4
Are you okay?

655
00:31:20,054 --> 00:31:22,2
That was my 21st bad date.

656
00:31:22,033 --> 00:31:24,4
And my 22nd is about to arrive any minute.

657
00:31:25,046 --> 00:31:26,3
Damn.

658
00:31:27,055 --> 00:31:28,7
Talk about stamina.

659
00:31:30,026 --> 00:31:31,9
I know this must sound crazy...

660
00:31:32,072 --> 00:31:35,0
but I'm starting to think that maybe...

661
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:37,9
I'm the problem.

662
00:31:38,006 --> 00:31:39,5
That is crazy.

663
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:41,2
You're awesome.

664
00:31:41,035 --> 00:31:43,2
What are you doing on these dates?

665
00:31:43,031 --> 00:31:44,3
Normal stuff.

666
00:31:44,044 --> 00:31:45,3
Okay.

667
00:31:45,077 --> 00:31:47,2
Well, why don't we...

668
00:31:48,036 --> 00:31:51,1
figure this out. Let's practice on me.

669
00:31:52,003 --> 00:31:57,5
We can pretend to be on a date and then
try to figure out what's going wrong.

670
00:31:57,062 --> 00:31:58,4
Okay.

671
00:31:58,058 --> 00:31:59,4
Okay.

672
00:31:59,091 --> 00:32:00,8
I'll start.

673
00:32:02,012 --> 00:32:04,3
Hi. I'm Eve.

674
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:06,6
Hey. I'm Maze.

675
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:08,2
Nice to meet you.

676
00:32:09,051 --> 00:32:10,7
Want to have sex?

677
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,0
Good.

678
00:32:14,014 --> 00:32:17,5
There's nothing wrong with having sex
on a first date.

679
00:32:18,014 --> 00:32:23,5
But, you know, maybe just wait
a few sentences before you go there.

680
00:32:24,085 --> 00:32:26,8
Okay, tell me about yourself.

681
00:32:27,044 --> 00:32:29,3
Well, I like sex.

682
00:32:29,061 --> 00:32:30,4
Good.

683
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,3
And?

684
00:32:34,016 --> 00:32:36,4
[groans quietly]

685
00:32:37,024 --> 00:32:39,7
It's just hard to open up about my life.

686
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,9
-I am a demon after all.
-What's wrong with that?

687
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:49,0
Anybody worth dating should understand
everything that makes you...

688
00:32:50,025 --> 00:32:51,0
you.

689
00:32:52,092 --> 00:32:55,0
Anyway, don't you have
another hot date coming?

690
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,3
[Maze] Looks like he's a no-show.

691
00:32:59,064 --> 00:33:00,8
Why don't we keep going?

692
00:33:01,077 --> 00:33:03,4
You know, this is really helping.

693
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:05,4
Yeah.

694
00:33:07,094 --> 00:33:10,2
So how are things going with Eve?

695
00:33:10,036 --> 00:33:12,3
-[balls clicking]
-Not good.

696
00:33:12,057 --> 00:33:15,6
I tried being a super bad boyfriend
so she'd break up with me,

697
00:33:15,074 --> 00:33:17,4
but it failed spectacularly.

698
00:33:17,053 --> 00:33:20,5
Of course it failed, Lucifer,
because that's not who you are.

699
00:33:23,054 --> 00:33:25,0
How do you know who I am?

700
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:28,7
[Amenadiel]
Caleb Mayfield is innocent, Chloe,

701
00:33:28,088 --> 00:33:30,3
you really need to look into it.

702
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:31,7
Did he say something to you?

703
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,3
Yes! That he's being set up.

704
00:33:33,038 --> 00:33:36,6
Did he say by who? Because I've been
looking at it as well and I agree,

705
00:33:36,076 --> 00:33:38,6
something doesn't add up.
It's just too easy.

706
00:33:38,076 --> 00:33:41,8
Whoever framed him must have known
that he would make a really good target.

707
00:33:41,089 --> 00:33:43,4
-You mean they knew he sold drugs?
-Yes.

708
00:33:43,056 --> 00:33:46,6
I had Caleb write down a list
of all the kids that he sold to.

709
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:50,0
Here's a list of everyone
who had access to the golf closet.

710
00:33:50,015 --> 00:33:52,3
If one of these kids
is on Caleb's list too,

711
00:33:52,044 --> 00:33:55,6
then that person would have means
and opportunity to set him up.

712
00:33:56,015 --> 00:33:57,2
So let's see.

713
00:33:57,053 --> 00:33:59,8
No. None of the names match.

714
00:33:59,095 --> 00:34:01,8
Aren't those two dating?

715
00:34:02,054 --> 00:34:05,6
[Chloe] Lexy Shaw and Nate Benedict.
And they're each other's alibi.

716
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,9
I'm sorry I didn't come forward sooner.

717
00:34:14,063 --> 00:34:15,8
I was afraid.

718
00:34:16,017 --> 00:34:17,0
[sobs]

719
00:34:17,084 --> 00:34:20,1
Maybe I didn't want to accept it.

720
00:34:20,064 --> 00:34:22,6
That he could do something like this.

721
00:34:22,089 --> 00:34:25,1
[sighs, shudders]

722
00:34:25,043 --> 00:34:27,5
So Nate killed Miss Baez?

723
00:34:27,081 --> 00:34:29,0
[Lexy sobs]

724
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:30,3
I love him.

725
00:34:31,044 --> 00:34:32,2
[sniffs]

726
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:34,1
But he can get so angry sometimes,

727
00:34:34,028 --> 00:34:35,8
-it's scary.
-Mm-hm.

728
00:34:35,094 --> 00:34:38,1
And Nate was devastated
when his parents split up.

729
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:40,0
I think he blamed it on Miss Baez.

730
00:34:40,066 --> 00:34:42,7
I just never thought he'd go this far.

731
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:43,8

732
00:34:43,095 --> 00:34:47,8
Lexy, let's take a break, alright?
And I'll go grab you some tissues.

736

She's lying.

737
00:35:04,026 --> 00:35:06,6
Then tell them the truth, Nate. Now.

738
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:10,0
It's all because of stupid Harvard.

739
00:35:12,015 --> 00:35:14,6
Lexy had to get in.
She insisted that I go too.

740
00:35:14,094 --> 00:35:17,4
And she got us a ton of Adderall
so we could study harder.

741
00:35:17,049 --> 00:35:19,5
My grades went up
and then the SAT came

742
00:35:19,061 --> 00:35:22,1
and Miss Baez was the test administrator.

743
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,4
You stole the test.

744
00:35:23,049 --> 00:35:25,2
[Nate] We knew she had a copy
in her office.

745
00:35:25,037 --> 00:35:27,5
I didn't want to do it and she made me.

746
00:35:28,004 --> 00:35:29,5
And then Miss Baez found out.

747
00:35:29,062 --> 00:35:31,6
That's why you were fighting
after the YEA meeting?

748
00:35:31,075 --> 00:35:35,3
She told me that if I didn't come clean,
she was calling my dad and then the cops.

749
00:35:35,046 --> 00:35:38,7
And when I told Lexy, she... freaked.

750
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:41,4
Said, "I have worked too hard
to get into Harvard

751
00:35:41,051 --> 00:35:43,0
and I'm not letting Miss Baez ruin it,"

752
00:35:43,018 --> 00:35:44,8
and she made me steal Caleb's club--

753
00:35:44,093 --> 00:35:46,6
You? You killed her?

754
00:35:46,072 --> 00:35:49,3
No! I couldn't do it, but Lexy...
Lexy did.

755
00:35:49,056 --> 00:35:51,3
And I'm just as bad because...

756
00:35:52,073 --> 00:35:55,8
Because I covered it all up and I lied
about Caleb. He didn't do anything.

757
00:35:55,094 --> 00:35:57,5
Why should we believe you, Nate?

758
00:35:57,061 --> 00:35:59,8
-I'm telling the truth and I can prove it.
-How?

759
00:35:59,094 --> 00:36:01,2
Lexy's bloody clothes...

760
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:03,9
I was supposed to get rid of them
and I didn't.

761
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:07,2
I didn't even care about Harvard.

762
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,3
Lexy just wanted me
to be someone I'm not

763
00:36:12,042 --> 00:36:15,9
and I should have stood up to her
before anybody got hurt.

764
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,3
I'm so sorry.

765
00:36:27,081 --> 00:36:28,9
So you're free to go.

766
00:36:29,006 --> 00:36:30,5
You got your necklace back.

767
00:36:30,077 --> 00:36:33,3
Yeah, I paid off Tahir, so...

768
00:36:34,035 --> 00:36:36,3
you don't have to worry about him anymore.

769
00:36:37,052 --> 00:36:39,3
Looks like I owe you a favor now.

770
00:36:39,069 --> 00:36:40,7
How can I get you back?

771
00:36:40,086 --> 00:36:42,9

I've been thinking about that

772
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:46,4
and I will accept nothing less

773
00:36:46,049 --> 00:36:50,0

-About what?

782

And he got all upset with me
because I laughed at the end of the movie.

783
00:37:13,077 --> 00:37:15,2
I thought it was a comedy.

795
00:37:39,029 --> 00:37:43,4
Er, no. I was married for, like,
thousands of years.

796
00:37:43,097 --> 00:37:47,3
And then, on my second try,
I found the one.

797
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:50,6
Yeah, but how did you know
that Lucifer was the one?

798
00:37:50,072 --> 00:37:55,6
With Adam, I guess I felt like
I was always trying to be...

800
00:37:58,056 --> 00:38:00,6
And then, with Lucifer...

801
00:38:02,053 --> 00:38:05,9
I feel like I can just be myself,
you know?

802
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:07,9
At least I did.

803
00:38:08,082 --> 00:38:10,3
Lately, I feel like he's...

804
00:38:11,033 --> 00:38:13,2
kind of pulling away from me.

805
00:38:13,074 --> 00:38:17,3
That's just Lucifer. He can be
a self-sabotaging jackass sometimes.

806
00:38:17,046 --> 00:38:19,5
But he will come around.

807

on Lucifer's girl.

00:45:42,057 --> 00:45:44,0
[sighing] You know...

914
00:45:44,061 --> 00:45:45,5
tormented.

915
00:45:47,074 --> 00:45:48,8
And how are you doing?

916
00:45:50,087 --> 00:45:51,7
[sighs]

917
00:45:57,008 --> 00:45:57,9
[glass clicks]

918
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,4
I broke up with Eve.

919
00:46:03,021 --> 00:46:04,0
[sighs]

920
00:46:04,076 --> 00:46:09,4
Well, you know, I'm sure, if it's what
you wanted, then it's all for the best.

921
00:46:09,051 --> 00:46:10,7
It is what I wanted.

922
00:46:12,056 --> 00:46:14,8
She was in love with the person
I used to be.

923
00:46:16,035 --> 00:46:17,6
I understand.

924
00:46:17,069 --> 00:46:18,6
You've changed.

925
00:46:19,002 --> 00:46:20,9
You've become a better man, Lucifer.

926
00:46:23,044 --> 00:46:25,5
You see, that's just it, detective.

927
00:46:27,007 --> 00:46:29,4
Eve sees me in a different way.

928
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,0
[Chloe] Mm.

929
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:32,7
But so do you.

930
00:46:37,058 --> 00:46:38,9
That's what makes you so...

931
00:46:41,025 --> 00:46:42,3
So special.

932
00:46:43,046 --> 00:46:44,9
The fact you see me that way.

933
00:46:46,092 --> 00:46:48,0
But I don't like...

934
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:50,3
how that makes me feel either.

What is?

951
00:48:23,081 --> 00:48:25,6
Every bad thing that's ever happened.

952
00:48:27,015 --> 00:48:28,2
With Eve,

953
00:48:28,036 --> 00:48:29,4
with the detective.

954
00:48:30,099 --> 00:48:31,8
[laughs]

955
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:35,7
Dear old Dad's back up to his old tricks,
manipulating me.

956
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:38,2
Using these two women to...

957
00:48:39,033 --> 00:48:40,2
tear me apart.

958
00:48:40,037 --> 00:48:41,7
Do you really believe that?

959
00:48:42,025 --> 00:48:45,9
With every fiber of my being,
but I also know it's a lie.

960
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,8
A grand deception
I've been telling myself for...

961
00:48:49,084 --> 00:48:50,6
[sighs]

962
00:48:50,076 --> 00:48:52,1
since before I can remember.

963
00:48:52,026 --> 00:48:55,6
Why do you think you've been
lying to yourself all this time?

964
00:48:55,076 --> 00:48:58,1
Because the truth
is so much harder to face.

965
00:48:58,056 --> 00:48:59,4
What is the truth?

966
00:49:01,022 --> 00:49:02,2
My devil face.

967
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:04,4
My...

968
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:07,2
devil wings,
everything that's happening to me,

969
00:49:07,036 --> 00:49:08,8
it's my own bloody fault.

970
00:49:09,086 --> 00:49:12,5
I brought this upon myself.
How's about that for starters?

971
00:49:12,082 --> 00:49:14,6
Don't you see? This is progress.

972
00:49:15,024 --> 00:49:16,9
Genuine progress.

973
00:49:16,099 --> 00:49:18,9
Unraveling these patterns of denial

974
00:49:19,008 --> 00:49:23,4
is the first step
toward resolving these issues.

975
00:49:23,054 --> 00:49:26,0
No, doctor, this isn't progress.

976
00:49:26,008 --> 00:49:30,9
Because if I'm doing this to myself,
then the real truth is...

977
00:49:32,055 --> 00:49:33,5
Is what?

978
00:49:34,068 --> 00:49:35,5
Is what?

979
00:49:36,005 --> 00:49:37,3
Come on, Lucifer.

980
00:49:37,093 --> 00:49:41,5
This will weigh on you
unless you face it head on.

981
00:49:42,093 --> 00:49:45,5
The real truth is what?

982
00:49:49,023 --> 00:49:52,2
There is something rotten inside of me.

983
00:49:53,044 --> 00:49:55,3
I find it near impossible

984
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:59,6
to drown out the constant cacophony
of voices whispering in my ear,

985
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:03,0
telling me I am evil.

986
00:50:03,016 --> 00:50:04,7
[shouts] I'm drowning, doctor!

987
00:50:06,046 --> 00:50:09,0
And I can't stop asking myself...

988
00:50:10,021 --> 00:50:12,2
[gasps]

989
00:50:12,084 --> 00:50:15,0
[shouts]
why do I hate myself so much?
