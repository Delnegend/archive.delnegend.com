'Cause he was always, like, watching him.

183
00:08:30,013 --> 00:08:31,5
Your work is very good.

184
00:08:31,067 --> 00:08:33,0
Do you ever do nudes?

185
00:08:33,009 --> 00:08:34,4
-Couples, perhaps?
-Okay, thank you.

186
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:38,7
I will need to hold on to this one,
but we are done here. Thank you.

187
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,7
-[Lucifer] Thank you.
-[Chloe] Thank you very much.

188
00:08:40,085 --> 00:08:41,8
[Lucifer sighs]

189
00:08:41,097 --> 00:08:43,8
Okay, Lucifer, I need to talk to you.

190
00:08:44,027 --> 00:08:46,4
Your extracurricular activities

191
00:08:46,056 --> 00:08:49,3
are starting to hinder our job.

192
00:08:49,069 --> 00:08:51,5
There is a dead man right there

193
00:08:51,065 --> 00:08:54,1
and you showing up to his murder scene

194
00:08:54,024 --> 00:08:56,4
in assless slacks...

195
00:08:57,007 --> 00:09:00,9
is not only disrespectful to the LAPD,
it is disrespectful to him.

196
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,4
So if you can't take what we do seriously,

197
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:05,2
then maybe you shouldn't be here.

198
00:09:05,067 --> 00:09:08,0
No, I understand, detective,
and I apologize.

199
00:09:08,008 --> 00:09:09,9
I haven't been at my best today.

200
00:09:10,013 --> 00:09:13,5
But I do take our work,
our partnership, very seriously.

201
00:09:14,042 --> 00:09:16,0
In fact, I hereby promise

202
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,8
that the personal shall interfere
with the professional no more.

203
00:09:19,055 --> 00:09:21,1
-[phone rings]
-Sorry.

204
00:09:22,006 --> 00:09:23,6
-[phone rings]
-Yeah, I...

205
00:09:23,068 --> 00:09:26,1
Silent from here on in,

206
00:09:26,069 --> 00:09:28,9
you won't even know
that I have a personal life.

207
00:09:28,098 --> 00:09:32,5

210
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:43,3
-Does no one need a demon today?
-[Eve] I could use one.

211
00:09:45,045 --> 00:09:48,0
Lucifer and I were supposed
to bake and Drake tonight.

212
00:09:48,042 --> 00:09:49,2
You know...

213
00:09:49,096 --> 00:09:51,0
Like, really bakes

214
00:09:51,017 --> 00:09:52,9
and watch a Drake concert.

215
00:09:53,013 --> 00:09:54,9
But he had to go back to work.

216
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:58,1
I'm really happy he has a job, I am.

217
00:09:58,026 --> 00:09:59,0
But...

218
00:09:59,055 --> 00:10:02,8
I just didn't think
he would be there all the time.

219
00:10:02,097 --> 00:10:05,1
Yeah, used to drive me nuts too.

220
00:10:05,093 --> 00:10:07,0
Until I got a life.

221
00:10:07,031 --> 00:10:09,1
Smashing heads, hunting bounties.

222
00:10:09,027 --> 00:10:10,6
You know, my own thing.

223
00:10:13,015 --> 00:10:14,9
I don't want to do my own thing.

224
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:19,1
You know, I happen to have
some free time on my hands today.

225
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,9
Why don't we do our own thing together?

226
00:10:21,032 --> 00:10:23,7
I'm sure Lucifer will be back any minute.

227
00:10:23,095 --> 00:10:25,4
Or maybe he won't.

228
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:29,8
You are Eve! You are the first
best party girl ever!

229
00:10:30,033 --> 00:10:33,7
Are you gonna sit at home
waiting for your man...

230
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:37,1
or are you going to come and party...

231
00:10:38,026 --> 00:10:39,1
with me?

232
00:10:40,001 --> 00:10:41,5
Well, I do like to party.

233
00:10:41,076 --> 00:10:43,1
-[crack]
-Yeah, you do!

234
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:47,9
Something on that
pretty little face of yours.

238
00:11:56,046 --> 00:11:57,2
Hello, brother.

00:11:57,038 --> 00:11:58,7
[laughs]

240
00:11:58,088 --> 00:12:00,5
It's good to see you, Remiel.

[Amenadiel laughs]

242
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,7
So, what brings you to Earth?

243
00:12:05,001 --> 00:12:07,2
Silver City run out of stags to hunt,

244
00:12:07,035 --> 00:12:09,1
you need a break from Castiel singing,

245
00:12:09,027 --> 00:12:10,8
or you just miss your big bro?

246
00:12:10,098 --> 00:12:13,3
I wish I was here
for such frivolous reasons.

247
00:12:13,064 --> 00:12:14,8
But we have a problem.

248
00:12:15,056 --> 00:12:17,4
For the first time in millennia

249
00:12:17,057 --> 00:12:19,4
I've sensed a new Celestial.

250
00:12:20,028 --> 00:12:21,3
A baby!

251
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,8
Right here in Los Angeles.

252
00:12:23,065 --> 00:12:26,2
But you already knew that.
Didn't you, brother?

253
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,1
[bell rings]

254
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:32,3
Oh, gosh!

255
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,5
Who is ready to bake and Drake?

256
00:12:38,096 --> 00:12:40,1
Lucifer.

257
00:12:41,005 --> 00:12:41,8
Doctor.

258
00:12:41,096 --> 00:12:44,4
Yes, well, I'm afraid
you've missed the festivities.

259
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:46,0
But if you like to come back Saturday...

260
00:12:46,014 --> 00:12:48,4
I came because you've canceled
three therapy sessions.

261
00:12:49,097 --> 00:12:51,5
I want to make sure you are okay.

262
00:12:51,064 --> 00:12:53,9
Oh, no, I'm fine.
I'm more than fine, actually.

263
00:12:54,027 --> 00:12:56,6
Living my best life on all fronts.

264
00:12:56,094 --> 00:12:59,0
Balancing work and pleasure like...

265
00:12:59,057 --> 00:13:01,3
like a finely calibrated machine.

266
00:13:01,044 --> 00:13:02,4
You...

267
00:13:02,061 --> 00:13:05,5
You haven't seen
a tiny divine brunette, have you?

00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:14,2
"You didn't show, so I went out with Maze.

Hope you are not dead. Eve."

270
00:13:19,038 --> 00:13:22,6
Well, I admit there are still
a few kinks to work out.

271
00:13:22,071 --> 00:13:24,5
Speaking of, if you'll excuse me.

272
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:28,3
It can't be easy all these years
upholding human law.

273
00:13:28,084 --> 00:13:30,4
Eve will love this.

274
00:13:30,055 --> 00:13:32,6
Exploring your caring,
altruistic side with Chloe...

275
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:34,0
"...us to enjoy together..."

276
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:37,1
...and now being in a committed
relationship with Eve,

277
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:38,8
who expects you to be your...

278
00:13:38,094 --> 00:13:42,8
-old hedonistic devil self at all times--
-Apologies detective.

279
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:46,2
Now, how many times can he program
this thing to say "Ever"?

00:13:51,045 --> 00:13:52,3

281
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,8
Thank you.

282
00:13:56,087 --> 00:13:59,1
When you bifurcate your life this way,

283
00:13:59,042 --> 00:14:00,9
good and bad,

284
00:14:01,021 --> 00:14:02,9
crime solver and...

285
00:14:04,063 --> 00:14:06,3
orgy host...

286
00:14:07,051 --> 00:14:11,2
you're effectively denying
half of yourself all of the time.

287
00:14:12,001 --> 00:14:15,3
Lucifer, if you don't stop
pulling yourself in opposite directions,

288
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:17,6
you're going to come undone.

289
00:14:18,052 --> 00:14:19,9
[laughs]

290
00:14:20,048 --> 00:14:21,4
What?

291
00:14:22,036 --> 00:14:23,7
That is preposterous.

292
00:14:24,023 --> 00:14:26,1
I mean,
I finally got everything I ever wanted.

293
00:14:26,028 --> 00:14:30,7
I've got a girlfriend who accepts,
nay, appreciates that I'm the devil,

294
00:14:31,012 --> 00:14:33,8
makes every waking moment
a non-stop bacchanal,

295
00:14:33,095 --> 00:14:35,2
and then, there's work.

296
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:38,1
And I don't need to tell you
how important that is to me.

297
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,2
No, you don't.

298
00:14:39,033 --> 00:14:42,0
So you see why I'm no longer
in need of therapy, doctor.

299
00:14:42,042 --> 00:14:43,7
Perfection achieved.

300
00:14:43,088 --> 00:14:46,3
Is that why you spent the last few minutes
ordering apology gifts

301
00:14:46,046 --> 00:14:48,4
for both Eve and Chloe?

00:14:54,064 --> 00:14:55,4
Oh.

304
00:14:55,072 --> 00:14:58,4
Well, I'm sorry, but we're going to have
to leave it there, doctor.

305
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:01,0
There appears to have been
a break in the case.

306
00:15:01,094 --> 00:15:03,2

[Lucifer, knocking] Detective!

310
00:15:19,096 --> 00:15:20,8
Hi.

00:15:23,038 --> 00:15:25,7

312
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:27,8
Sorry I'm late, okay?

313
00:15:29,042 --> 00:15:30,4
What have we got?

314
00:15:30,051 --> 00:15:33,1
Ella ran a facial recognition
on the sketch of Gary's stalker

315
00:15:33,026 --> 00:15:34,0
and got a hit.

316
00:15:34,018 --> 00:15:36,2
I guy named Vince Walker, ex-marine,

317
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:38,3
and we couldn't get a physical address,

318
00:15:38,047 --> 00:15:40,3
but his name is registered to that car.

319
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,6
So we're on a stakeout. Undercover.

320
00:15:42,077 --> 00:15:44,2
Understood, detective.

321
00:15:45,023 --> 00:15:46,4
You can count on me.

322
00:15:47,048 --> 00:15:50,5
I'll not take my eyes off that vehicle.

323
00:15:51,036 --> 00:15:52,7
Come now, brother.

324
00:15:53,024 --> 00:15:56,4
We both knew it was only a matter of time
before this happened.

325
00:15:56,074 --> 00:15:57,6
We did?

326
00:15:57,091 --> 00:16:00,5
Of course, there was bound
to be a child eventually,

327
00:16:00,066 --> 00:16:03,5
because of all the meaningless
sexual encounters.

328
00:16:03,058 --> 00:16:05,6
I wouldn't say they were meaningless.

329
00:16:05,071 --> 00:16:09,4
Please. Our brother Lucifer is a...
What do they call it here?

330
00:16:10,013 --> 00:16:10,9
A slut.

331
00:16:11,005 --> 00:16:11,9
Lucifer?

332
00:16:13,047 --> 00:16:16,9
You're here because you think
Lucifer has fathered a half-human child?

333
00:16:17,001 --> 00:16:18,5
[Remy] Must have been difficult for you.

334
00:16:18,064 --> 00:16:21,9
Bearing the burden of Lucifer secret alone
in order to protect him.

335
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:23,8
But I'm here now, brother.

336
00:16:23,098 --> 00:16:26,5
Together, we can put an end
to this madness.

337
00:16:26,065 --> 00:16:28,1
Oh whoa, whoa, Remy.

338
00:16:28,057 --> 00:16:32,0
What do you mean exactly by
"put an end to it"?

339
00:16:32,015 --> 00:16:33,4
As we both know,

340
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:38,7
it's forbidden for humans and celestials
to intermingle in an amorous manner.

341
00:16:38,091 --> 00:16:40,4
The child shouldn't exist.

342
00:16:40,054 --> 00:16:41,7
The child is innocent.

343
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:44,6
Exactly! Which is why
we must find the child,

344
00:16:44,075 --> 00:16:47,7
snatch it up and take it to Heaven
for the rest of eternity.

345
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,8
[thud]

346
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,7
Remy, put your wings away!

347
00:16:53,051 --> 00:16:55,0
Humans aren't supposed to see them.

348
00:16:55,026 --> 00:16:56,0
Right!

349
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:57,3
I forgot!

350
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:01,4
Please slow time so these barely sentient
creatures won't see us fly away.

351
00:17:01,052 --> 00:17:03,3
Well, I can't slow time.

352
00:17:05,048 --> 00:17:08,5
Because that would be too easy.

353
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:12,1
Look, this is our first
brother-sister hunt in over a millennia.

354
00:17:12,023 --> 00:17:14,1
Why not make it a proper challenge?

355
00:17:14,028 --> 00:17:15,3
[laughs]

356
00:17:15,045 --> 00:17:16,2
You are right!

357
00:17:16,057 --> 00:17:17,7
To the challenge!

358
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,5
Where might we find
the kind of human woman

359
00:17:22,066 --> 00:17:24,2
that Lucifer would impregnate?

360
00:17:24,054 --> 00:17:25,5
Actually...

361
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:27,2
I know exactly where to start.

362
00:17:27,075 --> 00:17:31,9
But... perhaps we should begin
with a change of clothes.

363
00:17:42,001 --> 00:17:42,8
[sighs]

364
00:17:43,072 --> 00:17:46,8
Lucifer, I'm sorry
that I was hard on you before.

365
00:17:47,027 --> 00:17:48,3
You know, we...

366
00:17:49,031 --> 00:17:51,1
We all have our personal lives

367
00:17:51,027 --> 00:17:54,0
and I go to parent-teacher conferences

368
00:17:54,015 --> 00:17:56,6
and you host sex parties, so...

369
00:17:57,065 --> 00:17:58,5
To each their own.

370
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:03,0
Look, as long as you continue to wear
actual pants to work...

371
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,5
then, if you're happy, I'm happy.

372
00:18:08,042 --> 00:18:12,9
[Lucifer snores]

373
00:18:15,034 --> 00:18:16,6
[Lucifer snores]

374
00:18:21,093 --> 00:18:23,3
[Lucifer snores]

375
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,7
You know, I'm not happy.

376
00:18:26,052 --> 00:18:27,5
Of course...

377
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:29,8
I want you to be happy.

378
00:18:29,094 --> 00:18:31,0
But the way...

379
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:33,8
that you are happy...

380
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,9
It makes me uncomfortable.

381
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:40,4
It makes me feel sick, to be honest.

382
00:18:40,057 --> 00:18:42,9
And yes, sometimes it makes me jealous.

383
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,2
So...

384
00:18:46,087 --> 00:18:48,5
I hate the way you are happy.

385
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:52,3
And...

386
00:18:53,021 --> 00:18:54,2
there it is.

387
00:19:03,064 --> 00:19:04,6
[smacks]

388
00:19:04,068 --> 00:19:06,3
[clears throat] Fetch me the goat!

389
00:19:09,018 --> 00:19:10,8
No, in the hat.

390
00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:12,8
We need to make sure this is the guy.

391
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:16,0
[footsteps]

392
00:19:16,098 --> 00:19:18,0
[woman screams]

393
00:19:18,053 --> 00:19:19,9
I think he is the guy.

394
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:26,0
[screaming] Help! Fire! No, no!

395
00:19:26,012 --> 00:19:29,2
There you go. Big, strong donkey kicks.
Now locate the trunk release.

396
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:31,1
[Chloe] LAPD. Step away from the victim!

397
00:19:31,096 --> 00:19:33,9
And stop... giving her notes?

398
00:19:36,017 --> 00:19:37,1
Vincent Walker.

399
00:19:37,021 --> 00:19:39,7
You mind? We're kind of
in the middle of something here.

400
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,5
[lady] Is this a part of the scenario?

401
00:19:42,026 --> 00:19:44,2
[lady] 'Cause we haven't done
crossfire drills yet.

402
00:19:44,034 --> 00:19:45,7
I need to give it a shot.

403
00:19:45,085 --> 00:19:48,5
[Vincent] You can put the gun away,
detective. I run a K and R outfit.

404
00:19:48,081 --> 00:19:49,7
Kidnap and ransom.

405
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:51,0
[slams trunk]

406
00:19:51,014 --> 00:19:54,5
We offer abduction survival courses
for frequent travelers like Joyce here.

407
00:19:54,065 --> 00:19:56,4
[Joyce]
They are the best in the business.

408
00:19:57,015 --> 00:20:00,5
My employer pays for everybody
in the Bogota office

409
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:02,4
to get kidnapped at least once.

410
00:20:02,065 --> 00:20:04,4
[mouths] It's my third time.

411
00:20:04,053 --> 00:20:06,1
Quite a thrill-seeker, aren't you?

412
00:20:06,058 --> 00:20:09,3
Okay, who payed you to kidnap
Gary Van Blunt?

413
00:20:10,012 --> 00:20:12,0
As usual, you cops have it all wrong.

414
00:20:12,075 --> 00:20:15,1
Our parent company payed Mr. Van Blunt
to audit us.

415
00:20:15,025 --> 00:20:17,7
That was a formality.
Typical government red tape.

416
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:21,0
Then he accused me of paying off
Bolivian border guards.

417
00:20:21,009 --> 00:20:22,8
-And were you?
-Of course he was.

418
00:20:22,093 --> 00:20:25,0
[Vincent] Damn right I was.
To keep my clients safe.

419
00:20:25,009 --> 00:20:26,4
Everyone in my line of work does.

420
00:20:26,051 --> 00:20:30,4
I told Gary his goody two shoes routine
could cost real people their lives,

421
00:20:30,056 --> 00:20:32,6
-but he wouldn't listen.
-So, you murdered him.

422
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:34,3
What? No.

423
00:20:34,077 --> 00:20:35,7
I tailed him a little.

424
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:37,6
Hoped to scare him into shutting up.

425
00:20:37,077 --> 00:20:39,3
From home to work and not much else.

426
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,4
The poor sav was the human equivalent
of watching paint dry.

427
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:46,6
Until he wasn't.
Couple of days ago he breaks routine.

428
00:20:46,074 --> 00:20:49,1
Takes off in a Malibu Canyon. I lost him.

429
00:20:49,037 --> 00:20:50,7
Cops pulled me over for speeding.

430
00:20:50,087 --> 00:20:53,5
And I suppose you have an alibi
for last night at 12:30.

431
00:20:53,087 --> 00:20:57,0
As it happens, I was on
a three-day mission to Cape Town.

432
00:20:57,008 --> 00:20:59,0
Flew into LAX a couple of hours ago.

433
00:20:59,088 --> 00:21:00,7
Are we good?

434
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:02,5
Mm-hmm. Okay.

435
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:07,3
Well, that was a bust.

436
00:21:07,068 --> 00:21:10,1
But now we know how Gary spent
the last day of his life.

437
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:13,0
In the 5,800 acres of Malibu Canyon.

438
00:21:13,073 --> 00:21:15,4
Alright,
I'm going to go back to the precinct.

439
00:21:15,052 --> 00:21:19,6
I'm going to work up a list of what homes
and businesses we canvas first.

440
00:21:20,048 --> 00:21:22,3
Why don't you go home and get some sleep?

441
00:21:22,044 --> 00:21:24,3
Nonsense, detective.
I've already had my cat nap.

442
00:21:24,044 --> 00:21:26,5
I insist you go home and get some rest

443
00:21:26,066 --> 00:21:28,9
and I'll burn the midnight oil
at the station.

444
00:21:29,024 --> 00:21:31,8
You're offering to do hours
of tedious research?

445
00:21:31,095 --> 00:21:36,4
I want to do whatever it takes
to secure justice for poor boring Gary.

446
00:21:37,008 --> 00:21:40,0
Detective, recent missteps aside,
you should know,

447
00:21:40,013 --> 00:21:44,3
when I'm on the job,
the job has my complete devotion.

448
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:46,5
Thank you, Lucifer.

449
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,4
That means a lot.

450
00:21:50,051 --> 00:21:52,5
So, I'll see you tomorrow.

451
00:21:53,027 --> 00:21:54,1
Bright and early.

452
00:22:04,028 --> 00:22:06,5
[both giggling]

453
00:22:11,058 --> 00:22:13,4
Oh, girl, don't even start.

454
00:22:18,012 --> 00:22:21,6
[Eve] It's just that when he leaves me
hanging like this...

455
00:22:22,046 --> 00:22:24,8
Reminds me of Adam.

456
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:28,4
You know I was his second wife, right?

457
00:22:29,026 --> 00:22:31,3
Literally created for the guy

458
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:35,2
and our entire marriage
he was just pining over

459
00:22:35,047 --> 00:22:37,6
wife number uno.

460
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:41,3
"Lilith tamed the beasts of the night."

461
00:22:41,056 --> 00:22:44,3
Stupid, perfect Lilith.

462
00:22:45,078 --> 00:22:47,0
She wasn't perfect.

463
00:22:50,049 --> 00:22:52,0
Oh, my God.

464
00:22:53,033 --> 00:22:56,3
My God. I'm so sorry.

465
00:22:58,008 --> 00:23:00,5
I completely forgot
that she was your mother.

466
00:23:01,025 --> 00:23:02,9
Yes, so did she.

467
00:23:06,046 --> 00:23:07,3
[bell rings]

468
00:23:10,076 --> 00:23:13,2
I've got a package for Eve from Lucifer.

469
00:23:13,064 --> 00:23:14,8
[Eve screams]

470
00:23:14,089 --> 00:23:17,2
Oh, my God! What is it?

471
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:19,5
Oh, my...

472
00:23:21,098 --> 00:23:23,1
I don't get it.

473
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,4
-You--
-Oh, this guy.

474
00:23:26,048 --> 00:23:27,3
Okay, I know.

475
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:34,9
[printer starts up]

476
00:23:34,099 --> 00:23:38,8
[printer whirring]

477
00:23:48,067 --> 00:23:50,0
Oh, look. There is a card.

478
00:23:51,026 --> 00:23:53,5
You really need a card
to know who that's from?

479
00:23:57,076 --> 00:23:58,6
Right.

480
00:23:59,006 --> 00:24:00,0
-Lucifer!
-[smack]

481
00:24:00,014 --> 00:24:01,5
Uh?

482
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,8
"For us to enjoy together"?

483
00:24:03,052 --> 00:24:05,7
I mean, this must be for someone else.

484
00:24:05,086 --> 00:24:06,6
[laughs]

485
00:24:07,002 --> 00:24:09,6
No, for us to enjoy together.

486
00:24:09,086 --> 00:24:10,9
The precinct.

487
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,7
That's why this young lady
would make a great decoy.

488
00:24:13,086 --> 00:24:15,9
Or keep Daniel company
on long stakeouts.

489
00:24:16,007 --> 00:24:17,8
-You know what? Enough!
-[Ella] Hey, guys!

490
00:24:17,091 --> 00:24:21,2
The suit doesn't fit!
Literally or figuratively.

491
00:24:21,058 --> 00:24:24,1
The clothes Gary Van Blunt died in
were, like, two sizes too big

492
00:24:24,021 --> 00:24:27,2
and a tax bracket more expensive
than anything else in his closet.

493
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:28,1
They weren't his.

494
00:24:28,021 --> 00:24:30,8
Wait, so the killer forced Gary
to change clothes

495
00:24:30,092 --> 00:24:32,9
before they pushed him
out the window, but why?

496
00:24:33,009 --> 00:24:36,6
Er... No, I don't think
they made him change clothes.

497
00:24:36,072 --> 00:24:38,7
I think they made him put clothes on.

498
00:24:39,006 --> 00:24:40,9
Found something on the map last night.

499
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:44,6
If you combine it
with Miss Lopez's findings...

500
00:24:44,069 --> 00:24:46,3
[Lucifer chuckles]

501
00:24:46,061 --> 00:24:49,1
I think I know where Gary was
when the killer snatched him.

502
00:24:49,027 --> 00:24:52,6
Oh, my gosh! Can I please come?

503
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,7
[Chloe] This is perfect.

504
00:25:03,087 --> 00:25:05,6
Just perfect.

505
00:25:06,075 --> 00:25:07,8
So cool!

506
00:25:10,013 --> 00:25:11,9
Sorry, but rules are rules.

507
00:25:12,009 --> 00:25:14,5
You want to go inside,
you got to get naked.

508
00:25:14,084 --> 00:25:16,3
Either that or get a warrant.

509
00:25:16,064 --> 00:25:18,1
Fine, I'll get a warrant.

510
00:25:19,055 --> 00:25:20,3
Lucifer!

511
00:25:20,089 --> 00:25:22,2
When in Rome, detective.

512
00:25:22,043 --> 00:25:23,7
Please, put some clothes on.

513
00:25:24,035 --> 00:25:25,5
We are professionals.

514
00:25:26,002 --> 00:25:28,2
Ella, see if you can get a warrant
from Judge--

515
00:25:29,056 --> 00:25:30,4
Beckers.

516
00:25:30,065 --> 00:25:33,0
-Bucket list?
-[Lucifer] Don't worry, detective.

517
00:25:34,028 --> 00:25:36,2
Miss Lopez and I are on the case.

518
00:25:42,004 --> 00:25:44,7
[Lucifer] You don't happen to recognize
this unfortunate-looking chap?

519
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:45,9
[guy] Mm.

520
00:25:46,004 --> 00:25:47,3
Don't recognize him.

521
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:50,0
Do you have any pictures of him
without his clothes on?

522
00:25:50,084 --> 00:25:53,2
Of course I know Gary!
He is the sweetest thing.

523
00:25:53,046 --> 00:25:55,6
He's almost as sweet as my mango coladas.

524
00:25:56,001 --> 00:25:57,5
Do you want one or two?

525
00:26:00,051 --> 00:26:02,7
I just can't believe Gary's gone!

526
00:26:02,081 --> 00:26:04,6
He's only been coming
for a couple of months,

527
00:26:04,068 --> 00:26:06,6
but he really found his happy place here.

528
00:26:06,073 --> 00:26:09,9
And how could you tell he was happy?
Oh, don't worry. We know.

529
00:26:10,073 --> 00:26:13,0
[lady]
And he was to active in the community.

530
00:26:13,011 --> 00:26:15,3
Chess club, book club.

531
00:26:15,065 --> 00:26:18,4
He even offered to help us all
with our taxes.

532
00:26:18,049 --> 00:26:21,7
Hold on. You are saying that Gary
was an avid nudist

533
00:26:21,078 --> 00:26:23,0
and a devoted accountant?

534
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,2
Naturalists come in all forms.

535
00:26:25,037 --> 00:26:27,4
In our community, we have teachers,

536
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,9
judges, scientists.

537
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,4
What about enemies?

538
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:33,6
Did Gary have anyone he butted heads with
in the community?

539
00:26:33,096 --> 00:26:37,7
Oh, Gary didn't have a contrary bone
in his naked butt.

540
00:26:38,009 --> 00:26:41,0
I can't imagine him saying
a harsh word to anybody.

541
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:43,8
[guy] Except maybe to Julian. Remember?

542
00:26:43,089 --> 00:26:46,1
We saw them arguing
in the meditation yurt.

543
00:26:46,043 --> 00:26:48,9
I couldn't understand exactly
what they were saying,

544
00:26:49,002 --> 00:26:51,0
I didn't have my hearing aids in.

545
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,2
But it looked heated.

546
00:26:52,048 --> 00:26:54,1
And Julian is...

547
00:26:54,027 --> 00:26:55,8
Julian McCaffrey.

548
00:26:56,048 --> 00:26:58,8
Son of the late Willow McCaffrey.

549
00:26:59,032 --> 00:27:01,2
The founder of Willow's Glenn.

550
00:27:01,057 --> 00:27:04,9
[guy] Julian inherited this place
after his mother died,

551
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,9
but he's nothing like her.

552
00:27:07,004 --> 00:27:10,9
He's brought in drugs and prostitutes.

553
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:14,3
[lady] Well, we are not sure
they are prostitutes.

554
00:27:14,042 --> 00:27:17,4
[guy]
Come on, Annie, you know as well as I do.

555
00:27:17,055 --> 00:27:20,4
That millennial pervert has turned
out little slice of heaven

556
00:27:20,051 --> 00:27:22,1
into a devil's playground.

557
00:27:22,022 --> 00:27:23,9
Well, I'll be the judge of that.

558
00:27:25,022 --> 00:27:27,6
Welcome to the VIP lounge.

559
00:27:28,031 --> 00:27:31,1
Speaking of which,
you two are not at all what I pictured

560
00:27:31,023 --> 00:27:33,4
when I heard that cops were here.
Who knows?

561
00:27:33,048 --> 00:27:34,8
-We're not cops.
-We're not cops.

562
00:27:35,002 --> 00:27:37,9
-I'm actually a forensic scientist.
-And I'm the devil.

563
00:27:38,015 --> 00:27:39,0
[laughs]

564
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:41,8
Oh, hey...

565
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:46,2
I wanted to say how sorry I was
when I heard about Gary.

566
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:48,9
He is going to be missed
by the entire community.

567
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,9
Cut the crap.

568
00:27:50,004 --> 00:27:53,1
We know you two argued
in the meditation yurt the day he died.

569
00:27:53,021 --> 00:27:54,9
[Julian] Well, it's not what you think.

570
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:59,2
I hate to speak ill of the dead,
but Gary...

571
00:28:00,084 --> 00:28:02,5
He was coming on pretty strong

572
00:28:02,063 --> 00:28:05,1
to some of our
more attractive female members,

573
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:07,3
making them uncomfortable.

574
00:28:07,047 --> 00:28:10,1
So I had to give him some firm advice.

575
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:12,8
Probably did him a favour, honestly.

576
00:28:13,035 --> 00:28:14,7
How altruistic of you.

577
00:28:14,085 --> 00:28:17,8
My point is that the last time I saw Gary,

578
00:28:18,015 --> 00:28:21,8
he was alive, and well,
and still trying to bat out of his league.

579
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:23,3
[girls giggle]

580
00:28:23,045 --> 00:28:25,6
So, if I can help you with anything else,

581
00:28:25,074 --> 00:28:26,9
I'm starting to prune.

582
00:28:28,003 --> 00:28:29,5
[Chloe] Yeah, you are.

583
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,7
What are you? A size 34 pant, 13 shoe?

584
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:35,3
Good guess. Why?

585
00:28:35,042 --> 00:28:36,5
You are under arrest.

586
00:28:36,092 --> 00:28:39,7
Oh, and the precinct has a strong
no-nudity policy,

587
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,8
so put on some clothes.

588
00:28:40,092 --> 00:28:41,9
And you too.

589
00:28:44,063 --> 00:28:48,5
[muffled nightclub music playing]

590
00:28:48,097 --> 00:28:51,4
How can human women wear
these torture devices?

591
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,4
-What are they called?
-Jeans.

592
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:54,9
[sighs]

593
00:28:57,081 --> 00:29:01,7
How could Lucifer ever procreate
with these jeans-laden humans?

594
00:29:02,069 --> 00:29:04,6
They are selfish and greedy.

595
00:29:05,086 --> 00:29:07,1
And they smell wrong.

596
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,8
Well, Remy...

597
00:29:10,037 --> 00:29:14,7
Perhaps Lucifer discovered
that not all humans are selfish,

598
00:29:14,091 --> 00:29:16,5
greedy and smelly.

599
00:29:18,025 --> 00:29:20,7
Perhaps he even met one
that was rather special.

600
00:29:21,088 --> 00:29:23,9
One that helped him learn things...

601
00:29:24,072 --> 00:29:27,3
about himself, and the universe...

602
00:29:28,072 --> 00:29:30,9
that he never would have learned
without her.

603
00:29:32,089 --> 00:29:33,7
Hmm.

604
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:40,3
Yeah. I'm just guessing about Lucifer.

605
00:29:41,048 --> 00:29:42,6
-Yeah.
-[phone buzzes]

606
00:29:45,015 --> 00:29:46,3
[phone dings]

607
00:29:48,062 --> 00:29:49,7
Advertisements.

608
00:29:50,024 --> 00:29:51,5
Greedy humans.

609
00:29:51,074 --> 00:29:52,5
[laughs]

610
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:55,1
[woman yells]

611
00:29:55,021 --> 00:29:56,1
[gasping]

612
00:29:56,021 --> 00:29:58,1
[woman 2]
Good job, you're doing a great job.

613
00:29:58,021 --> 00:29:59,8
-[man] Okay, honey.
-Alright, Courtney, push.

614
00:29:59,092 --> 00:30:02,3
[woman screams]

615
00:30:02,046 --> 00:30:04,6
[man]
Hey, hey. It's all the way, honey.

616
00:30:05,013 --> 00:30:06,3
[woman 2] There you go!

617
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:08,1
[screaming]

618
00:30:09,001 --> 00:30:09,8
[click]

619
00:30:09,097 --> 00:30:13,3
[female voice] And that is what
the birth process looks like up close.

620
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,3
Any questions?

621
00:30:15,014 --> 00:30:16,1
Yeah!

622
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:19,0
Can we see the part about
the torn perineum again, please?

623
00:30:19,069 --> 00:30:20,5
Erm...

624
00:30:20,094 --> 00:30:22,3
Giving the time restraints,

625
00:30:22,044 --> 00:30:24,5
perhaps it's best
we move on to infant care.

626
00:30:25,061 --> 00:30:27,1
Let's feed our babies.

627
00:30:27,036 --> 00:30:30,0
Now, whether your choice
is breast or bottle,

628
00:30:30,024 --> 00:30:33,5
what's most important
is the intimate bonding time

629
00:30:33,066 --> 00:30:35,9
you're spending with your little angel.

630
00:30:36,037 --> 00:30:40,2
In your arms, your baby will feel safe,

631
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:42,1
and satiated

632
00:30:42,021 --> 00:30:44,0
and, most of all, loved.

633
00:30:44,084 --> 00:30:47,7
Your babies will only be babies
for a short time,

634
00:30:47,084 --> 00:30:49,8
but the bonds they form with you now

635
00:30:49,093 --> 00:30:53,8
are the foundation
for healthy and nurturing relationships.

636
00:30:55,001 --> 00:30:57,2
That was beautiful, wasn't it?

637
00:30:58,035 --> 00:31:00,2
I'm so glad you are here, Maze.

638
00:31:02,036 --> 00:31:03,2
Maze?

639
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:06,1
So it's a coincidence
that the shoes and clothes

640
00:31:06,019 --> 00:31:09,7
Gary Van Brunt died in match your sizes
and favorite label exactly?

641
00:31:09,095 --> 00:31:13,0
Not to mention you were seen arguing
with him on the day he was murdered.

642
00:31:13,053 --> 00:31:15,2
Things aren't looking good
for you, Julian.

643
00:31:15,037 --> 00:31:16,7
Yeah, I'm not too worried.

644
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:19,2
Oh. Why is that?

645
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:21,7
Three.

646
00:31:23,029 --> 00:31:24,4
-Two.
-[door clicks]

647
00:31:27,001 --> 00:31:29,8
Judge's order. Release our client
on his own recognizance.

648
00:31:30,009 --> 00:31:31,9
What happened to
the two million dollars bail?

649
00:31:32,014 --> 00:31:33,0
Already paid in full.

650
00:31:33,009 --> 00:31:34,5
Well, this was fun,

651
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:37,7
but I've got a naked limbo contest
to judge at four, so...

652
00:31:43,015 --> 00:31:45,3
Hey, how did he get away with this?

653
00:31:45,061 --> 00:31:47,8
Yeah, McCaffrey?
That's his mom's maiden's name.

654
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:49,1
-Guess who his dad is.
-I don't know.

655
00:31:49,028 --> 00:31:51,2
-Jacob Tierning.
-As in Tierning Shipping?

656
00:31:51,028 --> 00:31:53,8
That's right. The guy practically owns
every port on Pacific.

657
00:31:53,095 --> 00:31:55,3
Well, that explains the confidence.

658
00:31:55,045 --> 00:31:57,4
One whiff of trouble
and daddy bails him out.

659
00:31:57,066 --> 00:32:00,7
Yeah, with the money they left behind,
the guy is practically untouchable.

660
00:32:01,029 --> 00:32:02,6
No one's untouchable.

661
00:32:06,084 --> 00:32:07,6
Eve!

662
00:32:14,014 --> 00:32:14,9
Eve?

663
00:32:23,094 --> 00:32:24,9
[Eve] Hey.

664
00:32:28,023 --> 00:32:29,1
I...

665
00:32:29,078 --> 00:32:32,2
I got you something too for us to enjoy...

666
00:32:32,078 --> 00:32:33,9
[laughs]

667
00:32:34,078 --> 00:32:35,6
together.

668
00:32:38,003 --> 00:32:38,8
[sighs]

669
00:32:38,095 --> 00:32:42,3
Look, I know you are angry...

670
00:32:42,062 --> 00:32:43,7
[Eve] I'm not angry.

671
00:32:44,008 --> 00:32:45,5
I mean, I was.

672
00:32:46,013 --> 00:32:48,9
But then I had a lot of time to think.

673
00:32:49,084 --> 00:32:51,2
And I realize...

674
00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:53,8
I used to be just like you,

675
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:55,7
with Adam.

676
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:02,4
I wanted Adam to love me so badly

677
00:33:02,077 --> 00:33:06,4
that I devoted myself
to becoming something I wasn't.

678
00:33:07,056 --> 00:33:08,8
In order to please him.

679
00:33:10,057 --> 00:33:13,4
I wanted to be Adam's ideal woman.

680
00:33:14,061 --> 00:33:16,1
But then I realized something.

681
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:20,4
I was never going to be Adam's ideal woman

682
00:33:20,058 --> 00:33:22,2
because, spoiler alert...

683
00:33:22,087 --> 00:33:24,0
I'm not Lilith.

684
00:33:25,029 --> 00:33:26,2
I am me.

685
00:33:28,042 --> 00:33:30,5
Yeah, I spent so much time

686
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,3
trying to be whatever Adam wanted me to be

687
00:33:34,038 --> 00:33:37,5
that I never once stopped
to think what I wanted,

688
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:40,0
who I had been all along.

689
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,3
Guess who helped me figure that out?

690
00:33:42,047 --> 00:33:45,1
If is not me, this is a terrible story.

691
00:33:46,027 --> 00:33:47,1
It was you.

692
00:33:48,044 --> 00:33:52,6
Lucifer, I was created
from someone else's rib.

693
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:57,0
I am literally a subset of another person.

694
00:33:57,057 --> 00:34:01,9
But you helped me realize
that I can become my own person.

695
00:34:03,008 --> 00:34:04,2
You set me free.

696
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:07,1
I just want to do the same for you.

697
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:08,9
[sighs]

698
00:34:09,004 --> 00:34:12,3
I see you pretending to be
something that you're not.

699
00:34:12,071 --> 00:34:14,0
You don't have to.

700
00:34:15,063 --> 00:34:17,2
You're already perfect.

701
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:24,5
You think I'm pretending to be
something I'm not?

702
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:28,1
Don't you?

703
00:34:42,033 --> 00:34:43,1
What?

704
00:34:44,066 --> 00:34:45,7
I have to go.

705
00:34:47,008 --> 00:34:48,4
It's a break in the case.

706
00:34:51,033 --> 00:34:52,2
Sorry.

707
00:35:00,022 --> 00:35:02,9
[Chloe] What's the son
of a power broker like Jacob Tierning

708
00:35:03,001 --> 00:35:05,3
doing running his mother's
hippy nudist retreat?

709
00:35:05,068 --> 00:35:08,4
Well, according to Jacob's
super unauthorized bio,

710
00:35:08,056 --> 00:35:10,6
Julian is the black sheep
of the Tierning family.

711
00:35:10,077 --> 00:35:13,4
Out of control partying,
multiple run-ins with the law.

712
00:35:13,048 --> 00:35:15,4
I mean this says Jacob
cut him off years ago.

713
00:35:15,082 --> 00:35:20,0
Except for the fact that he keeps sending
lawyers to clean up Julian's messes.

714
00:35:20,015 --> 00:35:21,8
What is any of these have to do with Gary?

715
00:35:22,057 --> 00:35:25,2
I mean,
he wasn't auditing the nudist retreat

716
00:35:25,033 --> 00:35:26,9
or any of the Tierning businesses, right?

717
00:35:27,008 --> 00:35:29,9
So then what motive could Julian
possibly have to murder him?

718
00:35:30,004 --> 00:35:34,0
Step aside, Daniel, because I've
just blown this case wide open.

719
00:35:34,046 --> 00:35:37,1
Just found this note in this pocket.

720
00:35:37,055 --> 00:35:39,5
And this is the suit that I wore

721
00:35:39,059 --> 00:35:42,6
or, more accurately,
didn't wear at the nudist colony.

722
00:35:43,064 --> 00:35:46,3
Someone must have put it in there
before I got my clothes back.

723
00:35:46,068 --> 00:35:49,4
Miss Lopes, do you remember
a woman named Marigold?

724
00:35:49,052 --> 00:35:51,2
[Dan] Seriously? For all we know,

725
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:54,1
someone could have put it in there
at one of your latest sex parties.

726
00:35:54,023 --> 00:35:55,9
Have you ever been to a sex party, Daniel?

727
00:35:56,007 --> 00:35:58,8
-We don't pass notes to each other.
-I don't need to go to sex parties--

728
00:35:58,094 --> 00:35:59,7
Guys, guys!

729
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:02,3
Marigold wasn't a woman.

730
00:36:03,007 --> 00:36:04,4
It's one of Tierning's ships.

731
00:36:04,057 --> 00:36:08,2
And the Marigold docks

Very funny, detective.

737
00:36:25,047 --> 00:36:27,9
You know, we wouldn't have gotten
this far without you.

738
00:36:29,097 --> 00:36:31,4
You did good, Lucifer.

739
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:36,5
Do you think I'm different
when I'm at work...

740
00:36:37,057 --> 00:36:38,9
to when I'm not at work?

741
00:36:39,057 --> 00:36:40,5
Mm...

742
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:44,5
I think we are all
a little different at work.

743
00:36:45,053 --> 00:36:48,5
You know,
trying to put our best foot forward and...

744
00:36:48,099 --> 00:36:52,9
But you think the person
I'm trying to be at work is...

745
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,8
Ah, I don't know, dishonest?

746
00:36:57,021 --> 00:36:59,1
Do you like work?

747
00:37:00,042 --> 00:37:01,3
I do.

748
00:37:02,017 --> 00:37:03,7
I like work very much.

749
00:37:06,076 --> 00:37:08,5
Work makes me want to be...

750
00:37:09,068 --> 00:37:11,5
a better man, but...

751
00:37:12,073 --> 00:37:14,8
if I've never been that man before,
then...

752
00:37:16,081 --> 00:37:18,0
is it even real?

753
00:37:18,015 --> 00:37:19,5
[Chloe] Well, I mean, I think

754
00:37:19,065 --> 00:37:22,3
people are growing and changing
all the time.

755
00:37:23,044 --> 00:37:27,5
I mean, look at me. Fifteen years ago,
I was naked in a hot tub.

-Mm, still one of my favorite films.
-Well...

757
00:37:30,033 --> 00:37:31,4
The point is...

758
00:37:31,066 --> 00:37:35,4
I never would've pictured myself
as a detective or a mom,

759
00:37:35,054 --> 00:37:39,0
or a person with so many
sensible brown shoes.

760
00:37:39,017 --> 00:37:41,5
-So many. [chuckles]
-Yeah.

761
00:37:41,075 --> 00:37:44,5
It just feels right.

762
00:37:44,059 --> 00:37:45,4
So...

763
00:37:46,005 --> 00:37:47,1
I think...

if what you are doing

765
00:37:50,035 --> 00:37:54,2
and who you are at work feels right,

766
00:37:54,068 --> 00:37:56,3

And Julian killed him
before Gary could expose the operation.

778

before they ever got on those ships.

921
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:41,3
[gunshots]

922
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,2
[groans]

923
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:44,1
What?

924
00:47:44,073 --> 00:47:46,5
Who... who are you?

925
00:47:47,053 --> 00:47:48,6
[hisses]

926
00:47:49,036 --> 00:47:52,1
I've been wondering
how to punish you, Julian.

927
00:47:53,032 --> 00:47:54,7
And now I know.

928
00:47:55,095 --> 00:47:57,1
What?

929
00:47:57,024 --> 00:47:58,2
[Lucifer growls]

930
00:47:58,029 --> 00:47:59,4
[thump]

931
00:48:06,025 --> 00:48:07,5
[Julian coughing]

932
00:48:09,026 --> 00:48:10,8
[Julian groans]

933
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:17,2
-[crack]
-[Julian yells]

934
00:48:17,031 --> 00:48:19,4
[Julian chokes]

935
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:23,5
You asked what I am.

936
00:48:27,077 --> 00:48:28,9
I'm the devil.

937
00:48:31,028 --> 00:48:32,2
Yes.

938
00:48:33,057 --> 00:48:35,7
This feels just right.
