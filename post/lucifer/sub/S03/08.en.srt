1
00:00:01,202 --> 00:00:03,537
Previously on Lucifer...
We're separated.

2
00:00:03,571 --> 00:00:06,407
Sign the divorce papers.
(grunts)

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,741
What's with the cold shoulder?
You seduced me.

4
00:00:07,775 --> 00:00:10,078
You almost die, and then
you ghost me for weeks.

5
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:11,745
Nothing about any of that
makes any sense to me.

6
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:14,148
Doesn't make any sense
to me, either.

7
00:00:14,182 --> 00:00:17,585
I used to see a light in you.
All I see now is darkness.

8
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:20,054
I just wanted
to say thank you

9
00:00:20,088 --> 00:00:21,689
for saving my life.

10
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:23,191
Take her gun.

11
00:00:23,224 --> 00:00:24,225
CHLOE:
He saved my life.

12
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:25,226
DAN: Chloe's fine.

13
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:26,227
Luckily, Pierce was with her.

14
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,328
But I wasn't.

15
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,397
Happy birthday, Detective.
Beautiful.

16
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,399
What is it?
It's the bullet.

17
00:00:31,432 --> 00:00:32,666
From when you shot me.

18
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,436
Oh.

19
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,439
*

20
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:42,176
LUCIFER: Mm, this is
a new one on me, Detective.

21
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,678
CHLOE:
Mm, mm, well,

22
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:46,380
there's a first time
for everything.

23
00:00:46,414 --> 00:00:47,715
LUCIFER: Yes, but I've heard
it can take hours.

24
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:49,683
I'm not sure even I have
the endurance for that.

25
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:52,353
CHLOE: Mm...
BEATRICE: Don't worry,
I'll help you.

26
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:54,355
I'll be the top hat.

27
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,190
I will be the race car,

28
00:00:56,224 --> 00:00:59,460
because I'm gonna
leave you both in the dust.

29
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:00,828
(laughs)
Very funny.

30
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:02,363
Uh, wheelbarrow,

31
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,165
shoe, ah...

32
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:05,566
Guess I'm gonna have
to be the shot glass.

33
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:07,601
Cheers.
Oh, that's a thimble.

34
00:01:07,635 --> 00:01:11,239
What? What? I want to conquer
real estate, not mend socks.

35
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:12,473
So then be the shoe.
Please,

36
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:13,541
I am not a shoe.

37
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:16,377
Clearly I'm a top hat,
so come on, hand it over.

38
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,812
Want it?
It's gonna cost you.

39
00:01:18,846 --> 00:01:23,684
Oh, well, name
your price, urchin.

40
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:25,486
Oh, I'm not talking fake money.

41
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:27,855
Oh, wow, she slammed you.

42
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:29,457
(chuckles)

43
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,559
* Give me a freaky
kinky nation *

44
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:34,162
* With a total female
population *
(elevator bell chimes)

45
00:01:34,195 --> 00:01:35,729
* I can deal
with that situation *

46
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:37,665
* I don't care
about my reputation *

47
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:39,567
* Give me a freaky
kinky nation *

48
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,502
* With a total female
population *

49
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:43,137
* I can deal with that sit...

50
00:01:43,171 --> 00:01:45,105
(music off)

51
00:01:46,374 --> 00:01:47,575
Imagine my disappointment

52
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:50,878
when I realized
there was no raging party.

53
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:52,713
It's a security thing.

54
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:54,148
Worked for that
Home Alone kid,

55
00:01:54,182 --> 00:01:56,350
but, obviously,
you can't take a hint.

56
00:01:56,384 --> 00:01:58,186
Wasn't I being clear
last time I kicked you out?

57
00:01:58,219 --> 00:01:59,787
Oh, clearly being a jerk.

58
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,557
Which is exactly why
I came to look in on you.

59
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:05,626
(drink pouring)
You see, we need the most love

60
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:06,727
when we're being most unlovable.

61
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,163
No offense, Brother,
but I don't need love from you.

62
00:02:09,197 --> 00:02:10,731
I get plenty
from naked strangers.

63
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:12,433
And speaking of,
I'm spent.

64
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,434
So, if you don't mind...

65
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:14,602
That's where
you've been, then,

66
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,737
having sex with
the nameless masses?

67
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,772
Oh, you know me, Brother,
wine, women and song.

68
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:22,543
Just, come on, run along.
I don't need a babysitter.

69
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:25,913
Your cheek says otherwise.

70
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:29,783
Well, it turns out
"Bruce Lee mid-fly kick"

71
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:31,919
wasn't in the artist's
repertoire.

72
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:33,654
(Amenadiel laughing)

73
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:36,524
Look, I had to cut a deal
with the detective's offspring.

74
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:38,926
So that's who
you were with--

75
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,528
Chloe and Trixie.

76
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:42,530
Well, so much for
wine, women and song.

77
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:44,632
Technically, all of those things
were represented,

78
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:47,568
when you count
the post-game karaoke.

79
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:49,903
Luci, there's absolutely
nothing wrong with...

80
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:52,273
with enjoying
a quiet night in.

81
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:53,774
I did not say that I enjoyed it.

82
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:56,377
Yeah, right. Honestly,
Luci, who cares

83
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,446
how you spend your nights?

84
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,314
Um, everyone.

85
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:02,983
My exciting lifestyle gives
regular people

86
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,819
something to aspire to--
I provide hope.

87
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:08,222
I see. And how does
Linda feel about this

88
00:03:08,256 --> 00:03:09,290
little ruse of yours?

89
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:11,759
I'm sure that the doctor
would love to dissect me,

90
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:12,960
but she's taken some time off

91
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:15,629
to deal with a death
in the family, so...

92
00:03:16,964 --> 00:03:18,999
I had no idea.

93
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,701
I should go check on her.

94
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:23,704
Yes, excellent idea.
You do that.

95
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:27,275
Luci, I'm liking
this new you.

96
00:03:27,308 --> 00:03:28,742
Boring suits you, Brother.

97
00:03:31,312 --> 00:03:33,514
(camera shutter clicking)
LUCIFER: Now, this poor victim,

98
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:34,982
she is boring.

99
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:37,651
We don't know
anything about her.
Oh, don't we?

100
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:40,488
Generic artwork,
dull clothes,

101
00:03:40,521 --> 00:03:41,555
beige furniture.

102
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:44,258
I mean, even her fruit bowl's
so tragically safe--

103
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:45,626
no mangoes, no papayas.

104
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,361
Not even a measly avocado.

105
00:03:47,395 --> 00:03:49,597
Her name's Kim Jones, 29.

106
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,664
She's a computer
engineer.

107
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:52,533
We ran a full
background check,

108
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,001
but we couldn't find
anything noteworthy.

109
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:56,270
A fellow nerd.

110
00:03:56,304 --> 00:03:58,005
I'm sure you're in
a better place now.

111
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:00,541
LUCIFER: Well, even if she's
in the worst place,

112
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:01,475
it'd be far more interesting
than this,

113
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:03,744
because this poor lady,
definitely a shoe.

114
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,746
Any idea what he's
talking about?

115
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:08,749
Oh, the other night
we played Monopoly.

116
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:10,818
So, that's that story.

117
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:12,320
Ella, what's the cause of death?

118
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:13,554
Uh, BABFT.

119
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:14,455
Hmm?

120
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:16,757
Big-ass blunt force trauma
to the head.

121
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,659
Murder weapon's missing,

122
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:22,363
but we are looking
for something small and compact.

123
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:25,366
Surprisingly heavy for its size.

124
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,900
Kind of like my Aunt Rosalita.

125
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,502
I wish Amenadiel were here
so he could see

126
00:04:28,536 --> 00:04:30,037
what boring actually looks like.

127
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,306
Can you believe that
he said I've become boring?

128
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,407
It's absurd.

129
00:04:33,441 --> 00:04:34,542
DAN:
Oh, I don't know.

130
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:36,777
Monopoly doesn't really sound
like the old Lucifer.

131
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,979
And I have to say,
you have become a bit

132
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:39,947
more normal.

133
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,982
How dare you.
Crazy idea.

134
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:44,418
Let's talk less about Lucifer
and more about the murder.

135
00:04:44,452 --> 00:04:46,086
Crime-scene selfies?
Really?

136
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,755
ELLA:
Classy move.

137
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,791
And that is Esther,
our victim's roommate.

138
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:53,327
She found the body when she
came home from partying.

139
00:04:53,361 --> 00:04:55,596
Well, what's such
a dynamic young lady doing

140
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:56,864
living with a... Kim?

141
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:58,966
Oh, never mind,
she looks traumatized.

142
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:00,501
I'll go comfort her.
Uh-huh.

143
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:02,670
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Hel...

144
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:04,972
No photos
at a crime scene.

145
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:06,674
Sorry.

146
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:10,344
Not even one last one
with the handsome cop?

147
00:05:10,378 --> 00:05:12,680
(chuckles) Don't let the boring
detective spoil things.

148
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:13,847
It would be my pleasure.

149
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:16,884
Right.

150
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:19,587
DAN:
Oh. (chuckles)

151
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,688
Bless your heart.

152
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:23,090
Obviously, I'm far
too well-dressed

153
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:24,091
to be a cop.

154
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:25,993
So, I take it that

155
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:28,862
you aren't close
with your roommate?

156
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:31,965
No, I don't spend
much time here.

157
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,668
Obviously.
Besides, me and Kim,

158
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:36,970
totally different squads.

159
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:40,374
Kim followed more people
than followed her,

160
00:05:40,408 --> 00:05:41,675
if you know what I mean.

161
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:42,976
#Shoe.

162
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,078
Can you think of anyone
who would want her dead?

163
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:48,849
I don't think anyone wanted
much of anything from Kim.

164
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:50,384
Okay, well,
there was no break-in,

165
00:05:50,418 --> 00:05:52,486
there was no struggle,
which likely means

166
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,487
that Kim knew the killer.

167
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:54,855
So, can you think of anything?

168
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:56,857
A recent breakup, a fight?

169
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,460
She did get into
a yelling match

170
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:01,395
on the phone last night
Oh.

171
00:06:01,429 --> 00:06:04,565
But I assume that was with
the Thai delivery place.

172
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:05,866
And I assume that's
the poor dear's

173
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:07,034
closest relationship?

174
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:09,570
What time was the...
the argument?

175
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:10,571
I'll tell you

176
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:11,872
if you hand me
my phone back.

177
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:14,675
I was getting ready
to go out,

178
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:18,111
and I totally remember the pic
I was uploading at the time.

179
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:22,483
There: kombucha martini.
10:39 p.m.

180
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:24,985
All right, I'll trace
Kim's phone call at that time.

181
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:29,156
You guys mind if I post
that I'm totes helping

182
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:30,724
a police investigation?

183
00:06:30,758 --> 00:06:32,125
Absolutely.

184
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,627
Do you mind tagging me?

185
00:06:33,661 --> 00:06:35,796
*

186
00:06:37,465 --> 00:06:39,833
CHLOE: Ella traced Kim's call
to this business.

187
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:42,503
Top Meet. Interesting name
for a Thai restaurant.

188
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:46,039
No, it's a dating app for
L.A.'s most fabulous singles.

189
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,107
Super exclusive.

190
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,909
Seems you need
to get recommended

191
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:50,911
and meet a bunch
of selection criteria,

192
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,780
even go through an interview
just to create an account.

193
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:55,616
Well, then, why would our victim
be arguing with someone here?

194
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:58,619
I mean, this is clearly
a place for top hats, like us.

195
00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:01,054
Please, I would never get
into something like this.

196
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:02,189
Eh, you're right.
What was I thinking?

197
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:05,993
It's way too exciting
for you, Detective-- I meant me.

198
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:07,828
And him.

199
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:09,997
Gosh, kindred souls.

200
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,500
This interesting young fellow
and I, wouldn't you say?

201
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:13,967
Except that, apparently,

202
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:16,169
he's slightly more
interesting than you.

203
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:18,071
Well, journalistic
hyperbole, clearly.

204
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,473
Eh...
Can I help you?

205
00:07:19,507 --> 00:07:21,609
Oh.

206
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:23,844
Mack Slater.
I'm the CEO.

207
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:27,047
If you are here for the
selection interview,

208
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,749
I'll spare you.
I created Top Meet

209
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,551
for people exactly like you.

210
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:31,952
Oh, well,
thank you very much.

211
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:33,921
I'm actually--
I was talking to the lady.

212
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,824
You're exactly my type.

213
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:38,959
I mean the app's type.

214
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:40,193
Bit on the nose there,
Big Mack.

215
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:42,095
We're here for a different
kind of interview.

216
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,698
There's been a murder,
and our victim's last call

217
00:07:44,732 --> 00:07:45,966
was to someone
in this building.

218
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:47,968
A homicide detective, huh?
(phone rings)

219
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:51,705
Uh-huh.
Wow. You just got
even more interesting.

220
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:53,574
Funny, so did you.

221
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:57,110
Just found out who our victim
was fighting with-- you.

222
00:07:57,144 --> 00:08:01,248
Ah. Most interesting
bachelor, indeed.

223
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:03,250
*

224
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,992
If you didn't know her,
then how did you fight with her?

225
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:13,627
'Cause she was nuts.

226
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:16,163
I'm confused, you just said
you didn't know her.

227
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:17,798
I know her type.

228
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,032
We get them from time to time.

229
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:21,268
They want to be on Top Meet,

230
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:23,036
they can't clear our high bar,

231
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,304
and then they get pissed
about it.

232
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,774
Problem with her was she just
wouldn't take no for an answer.

233
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:29,977
And then, uh, she hacked
her way onto my app,

234
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,111
and then our users
complained, of course.

235
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:34,948
Because nobody joins Top Meet
to hook up with some...

236
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:37,785
random nobody, and so
we had to kick her off.

237
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:39,219
Okay, and is that
when she got angry

238
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:40,220
and called to complain?

239
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:43,156
(laughs) No, it was more
like she went psycho.

240
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,192
Ah, well, boring people never
like to be told they're dull.

241
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:45,993
Right, Detective?

242
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,961
What did you do
after the call?

243
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:49,897
I stayed here, I worked late.

244
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,865
We've been busy as hell
these days.

245
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:53,166
Not nearly, I can assure you.

246
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,103
Well, I'd like to talk to anyone
who can corroborate your alibi.

247
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:58,271
Also, I'll need a list
of any of the users

248
00:08:58,305 --> 00:08:59,339
that complained about Kim.

249
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,808
No can do.

250
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:01,709
With so many celebrity clients,

251
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:03,944
our entire business model
is based off

252
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:05,979
our ironclad privacy protocols.

253
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:07,915
Fine, I'll just
get a warrant.

254
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:09,016
Good luck with that.

255
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,784
I mean, how long
did it take the FBI

256
00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:12,119
to hack one cell phone?

257
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,893
Yep, I'll have
the tech team get on it.

258
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:22,663
You got it, Chloe.
Ah!

259
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:24,064
CHARLOTTE:
Hello, Ms. Lopez.

260
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:29,169
I wanted to ask you something.

261
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:31,805
You know this darkness
that you say you see in me?

262
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,941
Mm-hmm.
I've been trying
to address it,

263
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:35,976
and, uh, details would help.

264
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:39,279
So, where do you
see it, exactly?

265
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:40,881
How? When?

266
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,816
Like, now.

267
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,685
Right about there.

268
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:47,020
Oh.

269
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:48,689
Hmm.

270
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:49,923
Little better?

271
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:51,224
But you know, still,

272
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,293
you don't exactly scream
rainbows and sunshine,

273
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,362
even when you're not
wielding murder weapons.

274
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:58,031
Well, for the record,
I wouldn't stab you,

275
00:09:58,065 --> 00:10:00,267
not here, with all
these cops around.

276
00:10:01,902 --> 00:10:04,371
Oh, come on, that was funny.

277
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:07,374
Oh, yeah.
Ha, ha. Funny.

278
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:08,776
Also dark.

279
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:10,410
Right. Fair point.

280
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,312
But it's cool.

281
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:14,948
You know, being dark.

282
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:16,383
To each their own,
you know?

283
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:19,086
Wow, you really have this
"being good" thing down.

284
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,187
Huh?

285
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,857
You know, you might be
just the person to guide me.

286
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:25,092
To where?

287
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,195
Somewhere other than Hell.

288
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:30,964
See, I've, um, I've learned

289
00:10:30,998 --> 00:10:34,267
that there are consequences
to my darkness.

290
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:37,404
Really permanent ones,
as it turns out.

291
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:41,241
And I was thinking
you could help me avoid them?

292
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:42,075
No way, José.

293
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:45,345
I mean, I wish
I could help you, I do,

294
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:47,347
but I'm so busy.

295
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,049
With what?
You know.

296
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:51,284
Cases, forensic stuff.

297
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,687
The lieutenant won't be back
from medical leave

298
00:10:53,721 --> 00:10:56,990
until next week, so it's, like,
cray-cray up in here.

299
00:10:57,925 --> 00:10:59,727
ELLA:
Oh, hey, Dan.

300
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,729
I bet you need me
to go do that thing, huh?

301
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:03,864
That super urgent
forensic thing.

302
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:05,232
Yeah, yeah. See?

303
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:07,901
Cray-cray.

304
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:10,904
Well...

305
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:12,105
I'm just gonna...

306
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:13,841
I was...
Yeah.

307
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:16,009
Bye.

308
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:18,278
(grunts)
Excuse me.

309
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:20,280
LINDA: You know,
you're exposing yourself

310
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:22,415
to dreadful consequences.

311
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:24,384
And I'm not talking
bad Yelp reviews,

312
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:25,919
I'm talking Hell.

313
00:11:25,953 --> 00:11:27,788
Turns out: real.

314
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:28,922
(laughing):
I know.

315
00:11:28,956 --> 00:11:30,323
I know, right?

316
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:31,524
Shocker to me, too.

317
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:36,196
But not as much as your dancing
queen candle arrangements!

318
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:37,297
Hey,

319
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,131
Linda.

320
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:40,467
Is everything okay?
Amenadiel, hi.

321
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,969
I'm so glad you're here.

322
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:44,004
I'm trying to plan
my ex-husband's memorial,

323
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,940
and I could really use
another opinion.

324
00:11:46,974 --> 00:11:50,077
Um, okay. So, which one
do you like best?

325
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,179
Just, knee-jerk reaction.

326
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,280
Go.

327
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:55,215
That one?

328
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:57,350
Really?

329
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:58,952
Really? You don't think
it's too ornate?

330
00:11:58,986 --> 00:11:59,820
That one.

331
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:00,954
You're right.

332
00:12:00,988 --> 00:12:03,256
This one's simple,
yet elegant.

333
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,358
See, you're just
the insight I needed.

334
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:06,459
Busy tomorrow?

335
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:11,364
LUCIFER: That looks
absolutely nothing

336
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,033
like our victim.

337
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:13,967
Take note, Daniel.
These filters

338
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:15,402
could be the answer
to your dating drought.

339
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:16,970
ELLA:
Or not-- I mean,

340
00:12:17,004 --> 00:12:18,371
Kim only got one match.

341
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:19,339
What-- really?

342
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:21,208
After all the effort
our shoe went through

343
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,209
to make herself
look like a top hat,

344
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,244
she only got the interest
of one gentleman?

345
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:26,847
Gentleman? You mean suspect.

346
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,082
Yep. Username,
FOREVER29.

347
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:30,183
The app arranged
a date for them,

348
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:31,518
and based on their likes
and locations,

349
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:33,520
it suggested a sushi place
on Melrose.

350
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:36,189
Even made a reservation for them
for the night of the murder.

351
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,457
CHLOE: This guy's
using the app

352
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,027
as a hunting ground; he could be
targeting somebody right now.

353
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:40,961
We got to find him.

354
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:43,263
Yeah, but how?
We can't even get an I.D.

355
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:44,965
Yeah. Tech team hasn't
been able to crack

356
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:46,166
Top Meet's security algo.

357
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:49,102
Which means Kim had
mad hacking skills.

358
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:51,338
So can we use
FOREVER29's profile pic

359
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:53,173
and run it through
facial recognition?

360
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:54,942
Yeah, I know, I thought
about that, but...

361
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:56,043
(Lucifer groans)

362
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:57,277
LUCIFER:
Partial profiles pics.

363
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,279
Such a telltale sign
of low self-esteem.

364
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:00,881
Or our guy's keeping
his profile secret

365
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:02,015
because he's the killer.

366
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:04,117
ELLA: Wait a minute, there is
some good news, you guys.

367
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:06,920
He used the app to RSVP
for a mixer at Top Meet.

368
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:08,021
It's happening tonight.

369
00:13:08,055 --> 00:13:09,122
Okay. We got to get
to this party.

370
00:13:09,156 --> 00:13:11,591
Use what we know about FOREVER29
and single him out.

371
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,725
LUCIFER:
Okay, fine. I'll go.

372
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,828
Seeing as I'm the only
interesting single person here,

373
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:17,064
I think I'm our one shot
to catching the killer.

374
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:18,431
Lucifer, we're looking
for a guy.

375
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:19,332
Your point?

376
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:20,033
DAN:
Uh...

377
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:21,568
He's a dude. And he's straight.

378
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:23,303
Mm-hmm.
That's never stopped me
before, Daniel.

379
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:25,906
I'm so good at flipping men,
they call me The Skillet.

380
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:27,140
Oh, wow.
Okay.

381
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:28,909
We need a woman, so I'll go.

382
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:32,112
What? You, Detective?
Socialize and flirt? Come on.

383
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:35,248
Yeah, but for the investigation,
I can sacrifice.

384
00:13:35,282 --> 00:13:38,018
Can't be that hard
being frivolous and shallow.

385
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:40,053
I'll just channel
my inner Lucifer.

386
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:42,289
What, you want to become
a female version of me?

387
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:43,256
Okay.

388
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,591
I'll gladly train you.

389
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:47,027
Chloe does Lucifer?

390
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,328
I wouldn't exactly word it
that way...

391
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:51,098
Get ready to go
full me, Detective.

392
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:58,205
LUCIFER: Oh, the Paris shows
were glorious.

393
00:13:58,238 --> 00:13:59,539
Yes, worth the jetlag alone.

394
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:00,908
How was your weekend?

395
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:02,275
CHLOE:
Uh, awesome. Great.

396
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:04,978
Uh, Saturday,
went camping with my daughter.

397
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:07,314
And, uh, Sunday,
did a big Costco run.

398
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:10,583
(laughs) There's, like,
300 hot dogs in my freezer.

399
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:13,253
Oh, really?
That is so interest...

400
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:15,488
Oh, dear. Look what you did
to poor Giancarlo.

401
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,490
Dead from boredom.

402
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,326
Now, look, you're going
to this Top Meet mixer

403
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:20,427
to hunt down a killer,

404
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,329
not to talk about your hunt
for bulk food bargains.

405
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,430
Okay.

406
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:26,934
Sorry I'm not fancy-schmancy
enough for Giancarlo.

407
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:28,235
Okay, let's get
the terminology straight.

408
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:29,336
Not "fancy-schmancy."

409
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,603
Sophisticated.

410
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:31,471
Oh, whatever.

411
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:33,974
Why don't you just
give me some tips

412
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:36,443
on how to blend in
with that crowd. Okay?

413
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:38,078
You think being
as fascinating as I am

414
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:40,347
can be boiled down
to a few tips?

415
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,415
This is not paint by numbers.

416
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:43,984
Goodness me, I need a drink.

417
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,087
Oh. Thank you.

418
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,556
I have a tip, Mom.
Don't talk about me.
Mm. Mm!

419
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:52,993
Yes, definitely,
no mention of the child.

420
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:53,961
Ugh.

421
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:54,827
And enough with the tips.

422
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:56,463
Why don't we do
a little role-play, hmm?

423
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:58,531
Okay.
You be a randy single man,

424
00:14:58,565 --> 00:14:59,632
I'll be...

425
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:02,002
I'll be the new you.

426
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:03,670
Okay, I've never once done that.

427
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:05,538
LUCIFER:
My point exactly.

428
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,941
Meet Lucinda. Come on.

429
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:15,282
Gosh, this is gonna be
harder than I thought.

430
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:16,516
(sighs)

431
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,161
Oh, crap.

432
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:29,396
(mouthing)

433
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,931
(panting)

434
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,734
(elevator bell dings)

435
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,203
(grunts)

436
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:47,480
Oh.

437
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:50,183
Need some help there, sir?

438
00:15:50,217 --> 00:15:51,618
There you go.

439
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:56,990
(exhales)

440
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,160
Good news, Ella.

441
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:02,695
I've been admitted to
the Forensic Shadow Program.

442
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:04,431
What is that?

443
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:05,632
A mentorship program.

444
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:07,200
Which means I will be
your student.

445
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:09,236
I am going to stick
to you like glue,

446
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:12,439
so I can learn how
to be good... at forensics.

447
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,207
Stuff comes up
constantly in court.

448
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:16,643
That's great.
UNI: Hold it, please!

449
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:19,346
(panting)

450
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:20,547
Oh, I don't think so, buddy.

451
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,715
I mean, what am I,
Mother Teresa?

452
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,630
My, my.

453
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,232
Detective.

454
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:40,367
You look...

455
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,102
Like a female Lucifer?

456
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:43,570
Well, that's what
I was going for.

457
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:44,504
(chuckles)
Well,

458
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:48,508
close enough,
but you're going to need this.

459
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,111
Do I really need to wear
an ear bug?

460
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:51,911
Absolutely.

461
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:52,745
From what we know
about our killer,

462
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:54,013
blue-eyed sushi snob
who loves surfing

463
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:57,150
and splooshing, I'd say you're
a bit out of your comfort zone,

464
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:59,686
so you're going to need
to bring Lucinda's A game.

465
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:01,054
You mean your A game.

466
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:02,255
Absolutely.
Oh, and while we're at it,

467
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:04,324
do you need a refresher on
"splooshing"? It's very simple.

468
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,259
You just cover yourself in...
No, no. Stop.
I'm good, I'm good.

469
00:17:06,293 --> 00:17:07,694
But-- oh.

470
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:09,696
Except for...

471
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:11,164
What, you don't want to wear it?

472
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:12,232
It's not...

473
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:13,600
really Lucinda's style.

474
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:15,268
Right.

475
00:17:15,302 --> 00:17:16,069
Oh.

476
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:22,609
Okay.

477
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:24,144
There.

478
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:25,245
I'm ready.

479
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:26,713
Yes, you are.

480
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:28,448
Good luck.

481
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:30,350
Thank you.

482
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,319
(cameras clicking)

483
00:17:37,124 --> 00:17:40,827
* Everybody's singing
the same song *

484
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,829
* It goes "tonight,
tonight, tonight *

485
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:44,131
* Tonight, tonight, tonight"

486
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:46,099
* I never realized

487
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:48,101
* These artists thought
so much about dying... *

488
00:17:48,135 --> 00:17:50,270
Hi. I'll get a, uh, IPA, please.

489
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:51,571
LUCIFER (over bug):
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

490
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:53,640
Not beer. Prosecco.

491
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:55,275
But I hate Prosecco.

492
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:57,744
Well, tough luck.
Lucinda loves it.

493
00:17:57,777 --> 00:17:59,846
(laughs)
Beer.

494
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:01,381
It's a good job I'm here.

495
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,082
Yeah, man. Close call.

496
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:08,855
(clears throat)

497
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:11,191
Possible suspect, moving in.

498
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:12,559
LUCIFER:
Right. Whatever he says to you,

499
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:13,860
just laugh.

500
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:15,862
(laughs softly)
Hey there.

501
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:18,198
What's your name?

502
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:20,133
(laughs)

503
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:20,867
Lucinda.

504
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,402
LUCIFER: No, no...
(laughs)

505
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,737
Not like a demented witch
on crack.

506
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,906
A deep, sultry laugh.

507
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:30,510
(laughs)

508
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:31,578
Ha, ha, ha.

509
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:32,645
Ha-- I'm sorry.

510
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:35,748
I think I may have had
a little too much Prosecco

511
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,684
on an empty stomach.

512
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:38,518
I should have
had that sushi.

513
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:40,387
Did you try the
sushi? Is it good?

514
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,223
No, no. I didn't.
I'm a, I'm a vegan.

515
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:43,890
Oh.

516
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:45,225
Anyway.

517
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:47,627
You might want to go easy
on the bubbles.

518
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,263
Ah.

519
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:51,331
(sighs)

520
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:52,532
Smooth.

521
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:53,800
Beginner's bad luck.

522
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,902
Look, it's hard
to do justice

523
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:57,804
to my captivating essence,
but she'll get the hang of it.

524
00:18:57,837 --> 00:19:00,473
Don't be such
a Debbie Downer, Daniel.

525
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:05,144
(quietly):
Sorry.

526
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:11,584
Hey.
Hey.

527
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:12,919
Hi.

528
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:14,254
You're really tan.

529
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:15,888
Are you, uh, are you a surfer?

530
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:18,391
Well, I'd sure like to surf
in your eyes.

531
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:19,459
LUCIFER:
Ugh, dearie me.

532
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,229
He's lucky it's not a crime
to be a cheeseball.

533
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:23,796
Anyway, at least
the ice is broken.

534
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,732
Now, just make small talk.

535
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:28,568
So I drove up
to this meditation retreat

536
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:30,270
in Big Sur last week.

537
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:31,304
No, no, no!

538
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:32,372
PCH is closed.

539
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:33,473
Say you helicoptered...

540
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,407
Shush.

541
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:35,842
Uh, excuse me?

542
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,944
Sploosh. I said "sploosh."

543
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:39,946
Are you into splooshing?

544
00:19:56,596 --> 00:19:57,764
(sighs)

545
00:19:57,797 --> 00:20:00,767
Time to change tactics.

546
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,435
You know what?

547
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:06,205
Enjoy the Prosecco, Lucinda.

548
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:09,976
I don't believe this.

549
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:11,878
Ditching protocol mid-sting?

550
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:13,313
Who does that?

551
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:15,582
Maybe she'll do better
on her own.

552
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:16,549
Don't be ridiculous, Daniel.

553
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,718
She'll flounder
without my expert guidance.

554
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:19,852
Oh, yeah.
Right.

555
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:21,521
I'm clearly needed
on the front lines.

556
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,756
You just stay here
and do what you do best.

557
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:26,526
Nada.

558
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,361
(scoffs)

559
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:32,699
CHLOE:
Oh, I love traveling.

560
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:33,800
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

561
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:34,901
Any fun plans coming up?

562
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:37,537
Um, well, I...

563
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,407
I was thinking of, uh,
maybe getting out of the city

564
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,709
and taking my
daughter camping.

565
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:43,810
Cool.

566
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:45,678
I-I love the outdoors.

567
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:46,813
CHLOE: Oh.
I'm a surfer.

568
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:48,615
CHLOE:
Really?

569
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:49,882
Goes well with camping.

570
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,784
I've always wanted
to try surfing.

571
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:52,919
But I...
You should...

572
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,921
Oh, hi, Lucifer.

573
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:56,389
This is Benji.

574
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:57,724
CHLOE:
He just had

575
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,025
four pieces of sashimi,

576
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:00,793
and we just started
talking about surfing.

577
00:21:00,827 --> 00:21:02,495
Oh, lovely. Now, I insist

578
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:03,963
you put your mic back in
immediately.

579
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:05,498
We can't hear a thing
in the truck.

580
00:21:05,532 --> 00:21:07,033
You are being quite loud.

581
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:08,968
(groans)
Nice work.

582
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:11,838
LUCIFER:
Bloody hell.

583
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:13,039
WOMAN:
Hey, there goes Benji!

584
00:21:13,072 --> 00:21:15,542
MAN:
Benji, over here!

585
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:17,510
Whoa.
You have to save me from them.

586
00:21:17,544 --> 00:21:18,778
DAN:
Uh, yeah.

587
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:20,947
They're with me.

588
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,649
Not bad for nada, huh?

589
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:23,750
(chuckles)

590
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:24,784
Wait, she's a cop?

591
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:26,052
Detective Decker, LAPD.

592
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:27,920
We want to talk to you
about a murder.

593
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:29,656
MAN:
Benji, you're the best, bro!

594
00:21:29,689 --> 00:21:30,823
You're not paparazzi?

595
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:32,525
What?

596
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:33,426
Oh, thank God.

597
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,429
I mean, the things
Dad gets credit for.

598
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:37,430
(mouths)

599
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:43,636
Yeah, I went on a date with her.

600
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,938
Just the other night.

601
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:48,841
Still can't believe she's, uh...
she's dead.

602
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,410
Oh?

603
00:21:50,443 --> 00:21:52,745
Did you think she'd survive
you murdering her?

604
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:54,681
I told you, I'm innocent.

605
00:21:54,714 --> 00:21:55,915
Well, you're an overpaid DJ,

606
00:21:55,948 --> 00:21:57,650
so that's up for debate.

607
00:21:57,684 --> 00:22:00,553
It seems you were the last
person to see Kim alive.

608
00:22:00,587 --> 00:22:01,921
I couldn't have been.

609
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:03,456
When I dropped her off
after our date,

610
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:04,657
her roommate was still there.

611
00:22:04,691 --> 00:22:05,692
How do you know that?

612
00:22:05,725 --> 00:22:07,560
Because that's the reason
I didn't go upstairs

613
00:22:07,594 --> 00:22:08,961
like Kim suggested.

614
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:10,129
I was trying to avoid Esther.

615
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,864
What, kombucha martini girl?

616
00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:13,666
Do you know her roommate?

617
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,568
To the extent
that you can know someone

618
00:22:15,602 --> 00:22:17,670
who's glued to her phone
and talks in hashtags.

619
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:18,905
(scoffs)
Yep, that's her.

620
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:20,407
How did you two meet?

621
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,710
We matched on the Top Meet app
a few weeks ago.

622
00:22:23,743 --> 00:22:25,011
Went on two exhausting dates.

623
00:22:25,044 --> 00:22:27,947
Then why go on the second date?

624
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,582
Because I wanted
to see Kim again.

625
00:22:29,616 --> 00:22:32,151
I met her at the apartment
when I picked up Esther

626
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,986
for our first date.

627
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,155
She wasn't there
the second time.

628
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,157
So you can imagine
how stoked I was

629
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,826
when she popped up
on the Top Meet app.

630
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:40,827
LUCIFER:
No.

631
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,028
I can't, actually.

632
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:44,163
You're saying that you used
a top hat to get to a shoe?

633
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,965
He must be lying, Detective.

634
00:22:45,998 --> 00:22:47,166
BENJI:
I'm not lying.

635
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,469
I really liked Kim.

636
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:52,071
She was different than all
the other women on the app.

637
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:53,506
What, different as in duller,

638
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,174
more mundane
and dressed for less?

639
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,510
No, as in she
didn't make me feel

640
00:22:57,544 --> 00:22:59,979
like I had to be on
all the time.

641
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:03,149
With her, I could...

642
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:05,084
I could just be myself.

643
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:07,420
Interesting.

644
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,389
Thanks.

645
00:23:11,758 --> 00:23:12,659
(clears throat)

646
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:15,562
What if Esther found out
about Benji and Kim?

647
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:16,963
Got jealous,
lost control...

648
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:22,569
This goddess,
jealous of the plain Jane?

649
00:23:22,602 --> 00:23:23,770
It's-it's ludicrous!

650
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:25,905
It's like me being jealous
of that paper clip.

651
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:26,973
Or Daniel.

652
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:29,108
I mean, not to mention

653
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:32,178
Esther is far too busy
for murder, Detective.

654
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:34,046
Look. She flew
to Florence last week

655
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,515
just 'cause she fancied
eating some gelato.

656
00:23:35,548 --> 00:23:37,083
She went on a plane
to get ice cream?

657
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:39,486
Well, when you say it in
English, it sounds silly.

658
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:41,954
Oh. Hello.
Look at that belfie.

659
00:23:41,988 --> 00:23:44,824
(chuckles) Bet you could bounce
a quarter off that derrière.

660
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:47,994
Oh. Yeah...

661
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:50,763
Wait, uh, go back.

662
00:23:50,797 --> 00:23:52,532
There.
What?

663
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:54,801
Something small and compact

664
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:56,135
and surprisingly heavy
for its size.

665
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:57,937
Well, what's Miss Lopez's
Aunt Rosalita

666
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,438
got to do with anything?

667
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,708
Look.

668
00:24:01,741 --> 00:24:02,942
The dumbbell.

669
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:04,110
It wasn't at the crime scene.

670
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:06,078
It matches the bruises
on the victim,

671
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:07,013
it's a weapon
of convenience,

672
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:09,148
and it fits the crime of passion
scenario.

673
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:11,784
Doesn't mean Esther was
the one to wield it, though.

674
00:24:11,818 --> 00:24:13,920
If my theory of jealousy
is right, she was.

675
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,755
Trust me, Detective,

676
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:17,990
there's no way that Esther
has ever used a weight--

677
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:20,493
I refer once again to her
naturally sublime derrière.

678
00:24:29,268 --> 00:24:31,671
(quietly):
Oh, crap.

679
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:47,854
You're avoiding me, aren't you?

680
00:24:47,887 --> 00:24:49,789
Don't be crazy.

681
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:51,591
No. I just...

682
00:24:51,624 --> 00:24:54,894
you know,
like my floors spotless.

683
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:58,164
An evidence lab can
never be too clean.

684
00:24:58,197 --> 00:25:02,802
And that is your Forensic
Lesson of the Day.

685
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:03,936
More next week?

686
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,838
Why don't you want to mentor me?

687
00:25:05,872 --> 00:25:08,641
It's not that
I don't want to, okay?

688
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:09,876
I just don't have the time.

689
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:11,110
Well, I've been watching you.

690
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:12,111
You have plenty of time.

691
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:13,946
You just waste it chitchatting.

692
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,615
You mean socializing?

693
00:25:15,648 --> 00:25:18,885
Connecting with people
isn't a waste.

694
00:25:18,918 --> 00:25:20,319
Okay.

695
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:23,623
Let's be honest here.

696
00:25:23,656 --> 00:25:27,326
You don't really care about
anyone's kids or whatever.

697
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,629
I mean, you're faking it, right?

698
00:25:29,662 --> 00:25:32,732
Just tell me, how do you keep
your eyes from glazing over?

699
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:36,603
There is no Forensic Shadow
Program, is there?

700
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:41,307
Even if I had been
tempted to help--

701
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,043
and I'm not saying
that I had--

702
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:45,812
now that I know you lied?

703
00:25:45,845 --> 00:25:47,346
Poof!

704
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,817
Temptation officially gone.

705
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:54,887
* All right

706
00:25:57,757 --> 00:26:00,126
* She said the ride is rough

707
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,196
* But love the way it rumbles

708
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,297
* Mmm

709
00:26:05,331 --> 00:26:06,899
* She said
the ride is rough... *

710
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:10,069
Okay, so I'm thinking:
big band over here

711
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:13,940
and two long, two long
buffet tables over here...

712
00:26:13,973 --> 00:26:15,241
or should we do three?

713
00:26:15,274 --> 00:26:17,076
Well, it depends. How
many people are coming?

714
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:18,745
Uh, just 350.

715
00:26:18,778 --> 00:26:20,947
350?

716
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,114
Wow.

717
00:26:22,148 --> 00:26:24,751
I didn't realize how much
you still cared about Reese.

718
00:26:24,784 --> 00:26:25,451
Of course I do!

719
00:26:25,484 --> 00:26:27,253
I'm heartbroken about his death.

720
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:29,121
Distraught, really.

721
00:26:29,155 --> 00:26:30,690
Can barely function.

722
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:33,926
Okay, okay.

723
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,630
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
I'm functioning perfectly.

724
00:26:37,664 --> 00:26:38,765
I only feel terrible

725
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:40,800
that I don't feel terrible
about his death.

726
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:42,902
Okay, so all of this
is just a...

727
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,771
A pathetic attempt
to cover up the fact

728
00:26:44,804 --> 00:26:49,408
that I can't stop thinking
about me.

729
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,711
Me, me.

730
00:26:51,744 --> 00:26:53,813
Me and my own brush with death.

731
00:26:53,846 --> 00:26:55,982
I understand, Linda. I mean...
How could you
possibly understand

732
00:26:56,015 --> 00:26:57,850
what it's like to be rotisseried

733
00:26:57,884 --> 00:27:00,286
by the, by the goddess
of all creation?

734
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:04,423
Dealing with mortality
was so much easier

735
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,626
when I was just another
clueless idiot.

736
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:13,299
Being a celestial insider...
really sucks.

737
00:27:13,332 --> 00:27:15,234
I used to walk
around thinking

738
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:18,437
maybe reincarnation was real.

739
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,907
Sure, it sounded bonkers,

740
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:25,344
but I could still wonder,
still hope.

741
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:30,016
What if I came back
as a chameleon or something?

742
00:27:31,918 --> 00:27:33,319
Chameleons are cool.

743
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:37,356
But now I know
that's never happening,

744
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:41,427
because I know,
you know, everything,

745
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:45,031
including where I'm headed
when... when this is over.

746
00:27:45,064 --> 00:27:46,332
And where is that?

747
00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:47,834
Where do you think?

748
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:52,238
I wish I'd never met any of you.

749
00:27:59,912 --> 00:28:03,750
CHLOE: So we wanted
to, uh, ask you

750
00:28:03,783 --> 00:28:04,917
a few...

751
00:28:04,951 --> 00:28:06,853
Would you want
to put on a shirt,

752
00:28:06,886 --> 00:28:09,856
or anything to cover...
your body?

753
00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:12,391
No. Why? Are you cold?

754
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:14,060
Yes. Would you like
my jacket, Detective?

755
00:28:14,093 --> 00:28:15,461
No. I am great, thank you.

756
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:16,863
Right.

757
00:28:16,896 --> 00:28:20,066
So, when was this photo taken?

758
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:25,872
Uh, I took that on my way
to Tokyo, I think.

759
00:28:25,905 --> 00:28:27,239
Sorry.

760
00:28:27,273 --> 00:28:29,241
I travel so much,
it's hard to keep track.

761
00:28:29,275 --> 00:28:30,209
(laughs)

762
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:31,477
It's actually
something else

763
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,979
that we're trying to track down.

764
00:28:33,012 --> 00:28:34,213
This pink dumbbell here?

765
00:28:34,246 --> 00:28:36,015
It went missing
the night of Kim's murder.

766
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:37,316
Any idea where it went?

767
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:38,117
Nope.

768
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,452
It's not mine.
I don't work out.

769
00:28:40,486 --> 00:28:42,221
Ah.
Everything you see

770
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:44,056
is God-given.
LUCIFER:
And they say that

771
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:45,792
Dad doesn't give
with both hands.

772
00:28:45,825 --> 00:28:46,893
So, the dumbbell.

773
00:28:46,926 --> 00:28:47,994
You're saying that's Kim's?

774
00:28:48,027 --> 00:28:49,228
Yeah. Poor thing

775
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:51,263
tried so hard to be like me.

776
00:28:51,297 --> 00:28:53,199
So how did it feel
when you realized

777
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:54,834
that Benji preferred Kim to you?

778
00:28:54,867 --> 00:28:56,335
Nuh, uh-uh-uh. Sneaky.

779
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:58,170
Don't listen
to the detective, darling.

780
00:28:58,204 --> 00:28:59,806
She's trying
to trick you.

781
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:01,040
You just look
into my eyes

782
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:03,542
so we can prove to her
that she's wrong.

783
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:06,112
Now, you're too sophisticated

784
00:29:06,145 --> 00:29:08,981
to care about your boring
flatmate's trifles, aren't you?

785
00:29:09,015 --> 00:29:11,884
Tell me, what is it
that you really desire?

786
00:29:11,918 --> 00:29:14,253
I...

787
00:29:14,286 --> 00:29:16,188
I...

788
00:29:16,222 --> 00:29:17,523
Yeah.

789
00:29:17,556 --> 00:29:19,525
...want to...

790
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:22,428
stop posing and lying!

791
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:24,931
It takes so much effort

792
00:29:24,964 --> 00:29:27,299
to make these pics look
so effortless.

793
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:28,300
It's exhausting!

794
00:29:28,334 --> 00:29:30,302
Well, so you're saying
it's just all a facade?

795
00:29:30,336 --> 00:29:33,039
I don't even know
what that word means!

796
00:29:33,072 --> 00:29:35,341
I'm not worldly at all!

797
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,280
#Barbados?

798
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:42,314
More like

799
00:29:42,348 --> 00:29:43,549
#Bogus.

800
00:29:43,582 --> 00:29:44,383
The most exotic place

801
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:46,385
I've ever been
is the gym's sauna.

802
00:29:46,418 --> 00:29:48,420
But you said
you didn't work out.

803
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:50,256
Of course I do.

804
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,959
With real equipment,
at a gym,

805
00:29:52,992 --> 00:29:54,293
not in my living room.

806
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:56,328
So you're still saying
that the dumbbell is Kim's?

807
00:29:56,362 --> 00:30:00,499
Yeah. She tried everything to be
part of my glamorous lifestyle.

808
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:02,902
She was even planning
on getting surgery

809
00:30:02,935 --> 00:30:04,303
once all the money came in.

810
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:05,404
What money?

811
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:06,272
I don't know,

812
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:08,474
but she made it sound
life-changing.

813
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:10,910
CHLOE:
Maybe the motive

814
00:30:10,943 --> 00:30:12,311
for Kim's murder
was financial.

815
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:14,280
Maybe she was coming
into some inheritance,

816
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:16,082
and someone wasn't
happy about it.

817
00:30:16,115 --> 00:30:18,250
I can't believe
Esther was a fake.

818
00:30:18,284 --> 00:30:20,186
I mean, how did I
completely misjudge her?

819
00:30:20,219 --> 00:30:21,320
Lucifer, are you listening?

820
00:30:21,353 --> 00:30:23,089
We need to look
into this windfall.

821
00:30:23,122 --> 00:30:24,056
Detective, I think

822
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:26,125
I've been spending too
much time with you.

823
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,626
It's turned my
top hat radar rusty.

824
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,162
What?
But no offense,
but I think I need

825
00:30:30,196 --> 00:30:31,931
to go and hang out with
some interesting people

826
00:30:31,964 --> 00:30:33,432
before you turn
me into a shoe.

827
00:30:38,404 --> 00:30:40,506
(seagulls squawking,
waves crashing)

828
00:30:46,645 --> 00:30:48,014
I'm sorry.
Mm.

829
00:30:48,047 --> 00:30:49,882
I don't regret meeting you.

830
00:30:49,916 --> 00:30:52,118
I just...
It's a lot.

831
00:30:52,151 --> 00:30:54,921
I've calmed down now,
so can we go?

832
00:30:54,954 --> 00:30:57,189
Lie down with me, Linda.

833
00:30:57,223 --> 00:30:59,325
On the... on the sand?

834
00:31:00,927 --> 00:31:02,328
Oh, okay.

835
00:31:05,031 --> 00:31:06,565
(seagulls squawking)

836
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:08,634
Listen,

837
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:12,471
there was a time when I, too,
thought that I knew everything.

838
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:18,044
This was... this was back
when I was an angel

839
00:31:18,077 --> 00:31:22,014
and spent all my time
looking down on the world.

840
00:31:23,983 --> 00:31:25,517
But, you see, I found

841
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:28,054
that it takes looking up
to gain perspective.

842
00:31:28,087 --> 00:31:29,956
It's a good reminder
of just how much

843
00:31:29,989 --> 00:31:32,058
there is that we don't know.

844
00:31:32,091 --> 00:31:34,260
Linda...

845
00:31:34,293 --> 00:31:38,931
if you really
think about it...

846
00:31:38,965 --> 00:31:41,633
do you have any fewer
questions than you used to?

847
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:43,335
When you didn't know?

848
00:31:43,369 --> 00:31:46,338
I mean, they're...
they're different questions,

849
00:31:46,372 --> 00:31:48,274
but there are just
as many, maybe more.

850
00:31:48,307 --> 00:31:49,208
So you're still every bit

851
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,410
the clueless idiot
that you always were?

852
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:54,146
(both laughing)

853
00:31:56,115 --> 00:31:57,683
(sighs)

854
00:31:57,716 --> 00:32:00,119
That helps.

855
00:32:02,121 --> 00:32:05,324
Still sucks about
the chameleon, though.

856
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:08,327
(laughs)

857
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,268
Thank you.

858
00:32:16,302 --> 00:32:18,404
(seagulls squawking)

859
00:32:24,043 --> 00:32:27,046
I can't find any sign
of that windfall.

860
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:30,249
As far as I can tell, there was
no money coming Kim's way.

861
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:31,717
Oh, there's got
to be something.

862
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,518
There is.

863
00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:35,287
Charlotte,
what are you doing here?

864
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:37,990
I felt unsettled
about lying to you.

865
00:32:38,024 --> 00:32:41,327
Um, I thought I could make up
for it by making myself useful.

866
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,397
So, I overheard you talking
about finding a connection

867
00:32:45,431 --> 00:32:47,666
between the dead girl
and that exclusive dating app.

868
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:50,302
So I did a little digging,
and I found one...

869
00:32:50,336 --> 00:32:52,238
Well, we're long past that.
Are you sure?

870
00:32:52,271 --> 00:32:53,772
I had to pull some strings
to get this.

871
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:56,142
It's an employment
contract

872
00:32:56,175 --> 00:32:58,077
between Kim
and the owner of the app,

873
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,278
Mack something.

874
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:02,114
Drawn up two years ago
in total secrecy.

875
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:04,216
But Mack said
that he hadn't met Kim

876
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,751
until she called him that night.

877
00:33:05,784 --> 00:33:07,253
Oh, he met her, all right.

878
00:33:07,286 --> 00:33:08,620
Kim hired him.

879
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:09,621
She hired him?

880
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:12,524
And then hacked his app?
It doesn't make sense.

881
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:13,625
Unless...

882
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:14,760
she didn't hack it.

883
00:33:14,793 --> 00:33:19,131
Top Meet's encryption protocol
is impossible to crack.

884
00:33:19,165 --> 00:33:21,033
Except to the person
who built it.

885
00:33:21,067 --> 00:33:22,068
Exactly.

886
00:33:22,101 --> 00:33:24,070
So, if Kim created Top Meet,

887
00:33:24,103 --> 00:33:25,604
then who the hell is Mack?

888
00:33:25,637 --> 00:33:28,174
(sighs):
Well, no computer whiz,
that's for sure.

889
00:33:28,207 --> 00:33:29,375
C-minus student,

890
00:33:29,408 --> 00:33:31,377
barely graduated
high school.

891
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,645
Voted Most Likely
to Sleep His Way to the Top.

892
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,115
And guess what he was
doing before Top Meet.

893
00:33:36,148 --> 00:33:37,383
Spin instructor.

894
00:33:37,416 --> 00:33:39,385
Okay, wh-why would Kim
hire him, though,

895
00:33:39,418 --> 00:33:41,387
if she's this genius
computer engineer?

896
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,255
What does he bring
to the equation?

897
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:45,157
Uh... that.

898
00:33:45,191 --> 00:33:47,293
Look at him
and then look at her.

899
00:33:47,326 --> 00:33:48,227
If both came to you

900
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,362
asking for funding for
an elite dating app,

901
00:33:50,396 --> 00:33:51,530
whose project
would you invest in?

902
00:33:51,563 --> 00:33:54,266
Well, yeah, if you're being
all superfish and whatevs.

903
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,334
CHLOE:
Which many people are.

904
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:58,537
Maybe Kim felt she wasn't
fancy-schmancy enough,

905
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,639
so she hid the fact
that she was the creator,

906
00:34:00,672 --> 00:34:03,675
and hired pretty boy Mack here
to be the facade.

907
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:06,512
In secret. Explains
why it didn't come up

908
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:09,115
in the background check.
So Kim's insecurities

909
00:34:09,148 --> 00:34:10,216
allowed Mack to take the credit.

910
00:34:10,249 --> 00:34:12,151
And the money.

911
00:34:12,184 --> 00:34:13,752
Which she wanted
to take back.

912
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:16,122
That's the windfall
she was expecting.

913
00:34:16,155 --> 00:34:17,189
It's a strong motive
for him to kill her.

914
00:34:17,223 --> 00:34:19,325
Yeah, but didn't his
alibi check out?
He could have

915
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:22,228
easily convinced one of his
employees to lie for him.

916
00:34:22,261 --> 00:34:24,330
It's a solid theory,
but still,

917
00:34:24,363 --> 00:34:26,532
it's just a theory--
we need proof.
(sighs)

918
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:28,334
I really wish we had
that murderous dumbbell

919
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:29,868
right about now.
Well, if Mack did it,

920
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,571
I think we know
where to find it.
Hmm? We do?

921
00:34:32,604 --> 00:34:33,672
Uh, there's a good chance

922
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:35,541
the murder weapon
is at Mack's place.

923
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,743
Seasoned killers know
to leave it at the scene,

924
00:34:37,776 --> 00:34:40,246
but first-timers,
they tend to take it with them.

925
00:34:40,279 --> 00:34:44,216
I can't count the times I've
allegedly helped a client unmake

926
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,817
that mistake.

927
00:34:45,851 --> 00:34:46,885
Really?

928
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,688
What? I said "allegedly."

929
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:52,324
We need to get a search warrant
for Mack's place.

930
00:34:52,358 --> 00:34:54,526
Yeah, good luck with that.
Excuse me?

931
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,728
Mack's lawyer will argue
that all you have is conjecture

932
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:58,297
based on circumstantial
evidence,

933
00:34:58,330 --> 00:34:59,598
and any judge will agree.

934
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:01,567
You're never getting
that warrant.

935
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,871
Well, then it's a good thing
I am exactly our killer's type.

936
00:35:07,906 --> 00:35:10,709
Mack! I love the place.

937
00:35:10,742 --> 00:35:11,643
Mr. Morningstar.

938
00:35:11,677 --> 00:35:14,713
How about
a gentlemen's weekend in Vegas?

939
00:35:14,746 --> 00:35:17,249
I need to scrape the rust
off my playboy ways, and you're

940
00:35:17,283 --> 00:35:18,484
just the chap to help this Devil

941
00:35:18,517 --> 00:35:20,186
get his groove back.
What do you say?

942
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:21,887
(chuckles)
That sounds fun.

943
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,821
Yeah.
Uh...

944
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:26,658
but I'm afraid I have
a previous engagement.

945
00:35:26,692 --> 00:35:28,527
Oh?

946
00:35:31,697 --> 00:35:33,632
(clears throat)

947
00:35:37,603 --> 00:35:40,272
Some alone time
with the detective?

948
00:35:40,306 --> 00:35:42,474
Not alone anymore.
Oh, Mack.

949
00:35:42,508 --> 00:35:44,743
I suppose we all have
our low points.

950
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:45,677
But not to worry,

951
00:35:45,711 --> 00:35:47,846
I've got a chopper waiting--
if we leave now,

952
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:49,515
we can still make the
Encore pool party.

953
00:35:49,548 --> 00:35:51,783
(chuckles) I'm afraid
you're gonna have to leave,

954
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:52,851
Detective-- I'm
trying to kick off

955
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:54,953
a Most Interesting
Bachelors' Bacchanalian here.

956
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,955
You leave. I'm having fun.

957
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,191
Something going on
between you two?

958
00:35:59,225 --> 00:36:00,892
Absolutely not.
Absolutely not.

959
00:36:00,926 --> 00:36:02,127
I'm gonna grab a beer.

960
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,264
Decide for yourselves who gets
the pleasure of my company.

961
00:36:05,297 --> 00:36:07,266
(chuckles):
Okay.
(chuckles)

962
00:36:07,299 --> 00:36:08,900
Well, I didn't have him
pegged for your type.

963
00:36:08,934 --> 00:36:10,202
I thought you
preferred them boring.

964
00:36:10,236 --> 00:36:11,270
You think I'm on a date?

965
00:36:11,303 --> 00:36:13,472
I am here looking
for the murder weapon, Lucifer.

966
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,407
What, so now you think
Mack's the killer?

967
00:36:15,441 --> 00:36:18,277
(chuckles) You're just profiling
fabulous people, aren't you?

968
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:20,679
Enough with this crusade
against us already.

969
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:21,913
Mack isn't fabulous.

970
00:36:21,947 --> 00:36:23,615
Kim created Top Meet.

971
00:36:23,649 --> 00:36:25,351
He stole it.

972
00:36:25,384 --> 00:36:26,852
What?

973
00:36:28,254 --> 00:36:29,821
Another phony?
Yes.

974
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:31,723
(sighs)

975
00:36:31,757 --> 00:36:33,959
I suppose that explains the
self-aggrandizing artwork.

976
00:36:33,992 --> 00:36:35,594
CHLOE:
Would you just help me

977
00:36:35,627 --> 00:36:36,695
find the weapon?

978
00:36:36,728 --> 00:36:37,963
Please?
(sighs)

979
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:40,999
Okay, fine, in my experience,
it's, uh, usually in the toilet.

980
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,501
Oh, I checked there.

981
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,503
Uh... freezer?

982
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:45,571
It's not there, either.

983
00:36:45,604 --> 00:36:46,772
Well, the fireplace, then.

984
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:48,440
(sighs):
Oh, Lucifer.

985
00:36:48,474 --> 00:36:50,309
There's no way.

986
00:36:50,342 --> 00:36:51,176
I mean,

987
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,611
could he really be
dumb enough to...

988
00:36:52,644 --> 00:36:54,280
(clacking)
to...

989
00:36:55,347 --> 00:36:56,382
Lucifer.

990
00:36:56,415 --> 00:36:57,416
Wha...

991
00:36:57,449 --> 00:36:58,417
Ah.

992
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:00,586
Well, I think you put
the dumb into dumbbell.

993
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:02,721
(gun cocks)
MACK:
Decided against the beer--

994
00:37:02,754 --> 00:37:04,323
because A) carbs, and B)

995
00:37:04,356 --> 00:37:06,858
two cops showing up
at my house on the same day.

996
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:10,362
Uh, figured that
must not be a coincidence.

997
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:12,731
Still think I'm dumb?

998
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:14,766
Basic deduction
doesn't make you a genius, Mack.

999
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,635
But then again,
you're used to taking

1000
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:17,903
more credit than you deserve.

1001
00:37:17,936 --> 00:37:20,906
Yes, Mack--
or should I say... Hack?

1002
00:37:22,408 --> 00:37:24,476
Waste of a pun. You're
gonna have to spell it out

1003
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:25,277
for him, Detective.

1004
00:37:25,311 --> 00:37:27,713
We know that Kim
created Top Meet.

1005
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:30,616
Oh, yeah? You know she was
also gonna destroy it, too?

1006
00:37:30,649 --> 00:37:33,051
She sneaks onto the site,
goes on one good date,

1007
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,521
and then wants to make the app
more accessible.

1008
00:37:35,554 --> 00:37:36,522
So stupid!

1009
00:37:36,555 --> 00:37:38,490
What's stupid
about thinking someone deserves

1010
00:37:38,524 --> 00:37:40,959
to be loved
for who they really are?

1011
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,894
Kim was the
brains, Mack.

1012
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:44,763
You were just the face.

1013
00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:45,997
Just the face?

1014
00:37:46,031 --> 00:37:48,900
Kim was Wozniak. I'm Jobs.

1015
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:51,303
No one gives a crap
about Wozniak.

1016
00:37:51,337 --> 00:37:54,406
Oh, please, Mack.
What you are is a fraud.

1017
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,742
Which, unfortunately,
makes you boring.

1018
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:58,677
And predictable. Watch.

1019
00:38:00,812 --> 00:38:02,648
Put that down.
Or what?

1020
00:38:02,681 --> 00:38:04,516
You're gonna blow your own face
to smithereens, Mack?

1021
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,385
It's quite heavy,
isn't it? At least

1022
00:38:06,418 --> 00:38:07,586
they got the density right.

1023
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:08,587
Ooh!

1024
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,322
Heads up!

1025
00:38:18,997 --> 00:38:20,999
Nice catch.

1026
00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:25,704
Today interesting
enough for you?

1027
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:27,673
Well, beats Monopoly.

1028
00:38:27,706 --> 00:38:29,007
(Lucifer chuckles)

1029
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:31,943
*

1030
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:34,045
LUCIFER:
But in the end,

1031
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,847
the shoe turned out
to be interesting,

1032
00:38:35,881 --> 00:38:37,816
and the top hat, boring.

1033
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:42,521
Right. So you're gonna
embrace your boring side now?

1034
00:38:42,554 --> 00:38:44,122
Well, I would,
but I have no boring side.

1035
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,892
Ah.
Even the most trivial
of nights takes a turn

1036
00:38:46,925 --> 00:38:48,560
for the exciting
when I'm involved.

1037
00:38:48,594 --> 00:38:50,729
I just got to throw
a man's own head at him.

1038
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:54,065
That sounds... painful.

1039
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:56,368
Oh, don't worry,
he deserved it--

1040
00:38:56,402 --> 00:38:58,570
for pretending to be
something he wasn't.

1041
00:38:58,604 --> 00:39:01,106
I mean, people really do waste
an awful lot of time

1042
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:03,842
trying to be interesting.

1043
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:04,976
People.

1044
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,378
Not you, though.

1045
00:39:06,412 --> 00:39:08,480
Oh, no. To me,
it just comes effortlessly.

1046
00:39:08,514 --> 00:39:11,717
All I have to do
is just be myself.

1047
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:12,651
Hmm.

1048
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:13,485
Mm.

1049
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:16,121
But what I really want
to know is,

1050
00:39:16,154 --> 00:39:18,056
how have you been doing?

1051
00:39:20,726 --> 00:39:23,061
Well...

1052
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:25,664
I was in a really dark place.

1053
00:39:27,499 --> 00:39:28,333
But...

1054
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:32,438
someone helped me
gain perspective.

1055
00:39:32,471 --> 00:39:35,774
How's that saying go?

1056
00:39:35,807 --> 00:39:37,609
We're all in the gutter,

1057
00:39:37,643 --> 00:39:40,045
but some of us are
looking up at the stars.

1058
00:39:40,078 --> 00:39:41,012
The stars are just gas bags,

1059
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:42,948
and I never would have
fed Oscar that line

1060
00:39:42,981 --> 00:39:46,184
had I known how much I'd have to
hear people quote it back to me.

1061
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,886
Oscar freakin' Wilde?

1062
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:49,621
Mm-hmm.
Really?

1063
00:39:49,655 --> 00:39:51,857
Now, he was
an interesting bachelor.

1064
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:52,891
(chuckles)

1065
00:39:52,924 --> 00:39:55,527
Anyway, I'm glad to hear
that you are doing better.

1066
00:39:55,561 --> 00:39:57,496
This calls
for a celebration.

1067
00:39:57,529 --> 00:40:00,131
So...

1068
00:40:00,165 --> 00:40:02,634
Oscar, huh?

1069
00:40:02,668 --> 00:40:03,502
Mm.

1070
00:40:03,535 --> 00:40:05,637
Tell me everything.
(sighs):
Well...

1071
00:40:05,671 --> 00:40:08,540
he was straight
when I first met him.

1072
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:13,411
(gasps):
Oh, God!

1073
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:16,081
That one was all you.

1074
00:40:16,114 --> 00:40:17,683
I was about to knock.

1075
00:40:19,585 --> 00:40:22,821
(sighs): There's...
something I need to tell you.

1076
00:40:22,854 --> 00:40:24,556
Funny.

1077
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:27,826
There's actually something
I need to tell you, too.

1078
00:40:29,595 --> 00:40:30,562
Thank you.

1079
00:40:30,596 --> 00:40:33,932
That contract helped put
a killer behind bars.

1080
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:35,701
You did a good thing.

1081
00:40:35,734 --> 00:40:37,035
I stole it.

1082
00:40:37,068 --> 00:40:38,537
Aw, man.

1083
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:40,038
Seriously?

1084
00:40:41,206 --> 00:40:42,508
You know what?

1085
00:40:42,541 --> 00:40:44,042
It still counts, okay?

1086
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:46,478
You did a bad thing.

1087
00:40:46,512 --> 00:40:49,915
But it was for
a good reason.

1088
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:51,182
Really?
Yes.

1089
00:40:51,216 --> 00:40:53,184
But only if,
in good faith,

1090
00:40:53,218 --> 00:40:55,554
you try to do it
the right way first.

1091
00:40:55,587 --> 00:40:57,923
Being good
takes practice.

1092
00:40:57,956 --> 00:41:00,091
Okay? So just keep at it,

1093
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:02,494
and you'll get better.

1094
00:41:02,528 --> 00:41:05,997
I guess I should take
that job, then.

1095
00:41:06,031 --> 00:41:07,766
What job?

1096
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:11,737
I've been offered a position
in the D.A.'s office to...

1097
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:14,606
help put criminals away
for a change.

1098
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,975
Yeah, but like you would
ever take that pay cut.

1099
00:41:17,008 --> 00:41:19,110
Yeah, I know.

1100
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:20,078
(sighs):
But anyway,

1101
00:41:20,111 --> 00:41:22,881
um, sometimes there's
more important things...

1102
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:24,282
than money.

1103
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:28,186
Oh, yeah. Yeah, like
all the things money can buy.

1104
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:31,122
Too late--
you talked me into it.

1105
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:32,524
I did?

1106
00:41:32,558 --> 00:41:36,094
Yes. This job is
the perfect place...

1107
00:41:36,127 --> 00:41:38,697
to practice
this "being good" thing.

1108
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:39,798
And bonus.

1109
00:41:41,032 --> 00:41:42,901
I'll be around here more.

1110
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:45,804
(chuckles quietly)

1111
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:47,873
Yeah.

1112
00:41:47,906 --> 00:41:49,708
Bonus.

1113
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:55,080
So, how did
Lucinda do, Mom?

1114
00:41:55,113 --> 00:41:57,315
Uh, she did... okay.

1115
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:00,185
Helped us catch the
bad guy in the end.

1116
00:42:00,218 --> 00:42:02,253
Thank you.
No, I meant...

1117
00:42:02,287 --> 00:42:04,823
how did meeting new people
at the party go?

1118
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:06,925
Oh.

1119
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:08,326
Well, um...

1120
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:11,997
I actually...
had a pretty good time.

1121
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:15,300
I mean, but only once I...
stopped being Lucinda

1122
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:17,736
and started being myself.

1123
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:23,742
You know, it can be scary
sometimes, but...

1124
00:42:23,775 --> 00:42:27,312
being who you really are
is never a bad idea.

1125
00:42:27,345 --> 00:42:29,848
Hey, there's a piece missing.

1126
00:42:31,683 --> 00:42:34,185
(mellow jazz piano playing)

1127
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:36,822
*

1128
00:42:43,128 --> 00:42:45,096
Lucifer.

1129
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:46,732
(exhales)

1130
00:42:46,765 --> 00:42:47,933
Are you coming?

1131
00:42:47,966 --> 00:42:49,067
Uh...

1132
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,970
how about a nice
round of Monopoly?

1133
00:42:52,003 --> 00:42:53,204
Yeah?

1134
00:42:53,238 --> 00:42:55,206
Little face-
painting, maybe?

1135
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,308
(chuckles)

1136
00:42:57,342 --> 00:42:59,745
I didn't think so.

1137
00:43:00,178 --> 00:43:01,880
Hmm.

1138
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:03,849
