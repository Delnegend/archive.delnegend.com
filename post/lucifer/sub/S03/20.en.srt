might tell someone else,

else, which could lead to

might not care, Luci,

I mean, there must be some sort
of reasonable explanation.

182
00:06:53,674 --> 00:06:55,197
And you don't remember
how the figurine

183
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,590
got into your bedroom?
No.

184
00:06:56,633 --> 00:06:58,635
I mean, maybe it's
a housewarming gift or...

185
00:06:58,679 --> 00:07:00,855
or a sex toy.

186
00:07:00,898 --> 00:07:02,204
Or a housewarming gift
sex toy.

187
00:07:02,247 --> 00:07:03,814
I just...
[laughs]

188
00:07:03,858 --> 00:07:05,033
And it's identical
to the one missing

189
00:07:05,076 --> 00:07:06,208
from that woman's house?Yes.

190
00:07:06,251 --> 00:07:09,646
But it's coincidence, surely.

191
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:13,041
You've been complaining about
having weird dreams lately.

192
00:07:13,084 --> 00:07:15,826
Including one where you
couldn't control your wings.

193
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,568
I've also dreamt I was
king of the centaur people.

194
00:07:18,612 --> 00:07:21,136
Doesn't mean I'm gonna
start wearing horseshoes.

195
00:07:21,179 --> 00:07:23,268
There have been instances
where people sleepwalk

196
00:07:23,312 --> 00:07:25,575
when they're having difficulty
dealing with painful situations.

197
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:28,709
Or, inversely,
not dealing with them.

198
00:07:28,752 --> 00:07:31,015
Is it possible you're
not dealing with something,

199
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:33,888
and, thus, sleepflying?

200
00:07:33,931 --> 00:07:35,237
That's absurd. I mean,
what in the world

201
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,848
could I not be dealing with?I don't know.

202
00:07:37,892 --> 00:07:40,721
Chloe and Pierce, maybe?
Perhaps you're not as

203
00:07:40,764 --> 00:07:43,245
okay with that relationship
as you think.

204
00:07:43,288 --> 00:07:45,377
Look, I am not an idiot, Doctor.

205
00:07:45,421 --> 00:07:48,380
Clearly, I don't
love them together,

206
00:07:48,424 --> 00:07:50,557
But I'm also not
a 16-year-old

207
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,559
crying in my bedroom
with Adele on repeat.

208
00:07:52,602 --> 00:07:53,690
[laughs]

209
00:07:53,734 --> 00:07:56,214
And I'm definitely
not this angel.

210
00:07:56,258 --> 00:07:59,696
And, I know just
how to prove it.

211
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:03,874
PIERCE:
This was nice.

212
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:07,399
This was...

213
00:08:07,443 --> 00:08:09,401
Crap.

214
00:08:09,445 --> 00:08:10,664
Wow, not even remotely close

215
00:08:10,707 --> 00:08:12,056
to what I thought
you were gonna say.

216
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,363
No, no, the time.
We got to go.

217
00:08:14,406 --> 00:08:15,538
What? Why?

218
00:08:15,582 --> 00:08:16,887
Trixie's gonna be home
any minute.

219
00:08:16,931 --> 00:08:19,237
And you don't want her
to see me here.

220
00:08:19,281 --> 00:08:20,674
Look, you're pretty much
the first person

221
00:08:20,717 --> 00:08:22,066
that I've dated since Dan.

222
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,721
I haven't introduced Trixie
to anybody.

223
00:08:24,765 --> 00:08:28,899
And I just don't want
to do that until I'm sure.

224
00:08:28,943 --> 00:08:30,466
And it's not that
I'm not sure.

225
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,425
I just, I-I want to be ready,
and I want to know. You know?

226
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:34,470
Maybe I shouldn't
have said all that.

227
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,385
Anyhow...What's the prob...

228
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:42,130
Listen, fast or slow,
whatever the speed,

229
00:08:42,173 --> 00:08:43,479
I'm into this.

230
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,785
If you haven't
figured it out, Chloe,

231
00:08:44,828 --> 00:08:46,787
I'm in...

232
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:49,137
I like you.

233
00:08:51,052 --> 00:08:53,402
[phone chiming]

234
00:08:53,445 --> 00:08:55,709
Sorry.

235
00:08:55,752 --> 00:08:57,580
[clears throat]Oh, it's Lucifer.

236
00:08:57,624 --> 00:09:00,540
Of course it is.
Got to go.

237
00:09:02,846 --> 00:09:04,674
Ah!

238
00:09:04,718 --> 00:09:05,675
Good, you're here.

239
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:07,590
We need to find the killer.

240
00:09:07,634 --> 00:09:09,244
Is this that super
important thing

241
00:09:09,287 --> 00:09:11,115
you said you needed
to talk to me about?

242
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:14,031
Yes, because this case is of the
utmost importance to me now.

243
00:09:14,075 --> 00:09:16,599
Really? Why?
Because if,

244
00:09:16,643 --> 00:09:18,514
in the miniscule realm
of possibility,

245
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,777
that crazy old lady did,
in fact, see an angel,

246
00:09:20,821 --> 00:09:23,127
I need to prove that
the angel wasn't me.

247
00:09:23,171 --> 00:09:25,347
I think I can help with that.
It wasn't you.

248
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,653
Well, I'm sure
you're probably right.

249
00:09:26,696 --> 00:09:28,132
And when the killer
confirms as such,

250
00:09:28,176 --> 00:09:29,264
I'll be one happy Devil.

251
00:09:29,307 --> 00:09:30,613
So, come on, chop-chop.
What do we got?

252
00:09:30,657 --> 00:09:31,788
[sighs]

253
00:09:31,832 --> 00:09:34,312
Okay, two days ago,
Kevin checked out

254
00:09:34,356 --> 00:09:36,967
of a high-end rehab
facility-- Sunrise Sands.

255
00:09:37,011 --> 00:09:38,490
And according to this
incident report,

256
00:09:38,534 --> 00:09:40,623
he got into a pretty nasty fight
with a fellow resident

257
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:43,626
right before he left--
a guy named Phil Goldstein.

258
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,323
Yeah, come on.
I'm driving.

259
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:46,977
♪ I know you've been waiting

260
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:48,805

LUCIFER: I don't understand
why humans waste so much time

264
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,683
resisting their desires.

265
00:09:56,726 --> 00:09:58,815
A rehabilitation center
for drugs and sex. [laughs]

266
00:09:58,859 --> 00:10:00,600
CHLOE:
Mr. Goldstein?

267
00:10:00,643 --> 00:10:01,862
[moans softly]Detective Chloe Decker,

268
00:10:01,905 --> 00:10:04,386
LAPD. We'd like to ask
you a few questions

269
00:10:04,429 --> 00:10:05,561
about Kevin Winstead.

270
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,129
The answer's yes...
he's a douchebag.

271
00:10:08,172 --> 00:10:10,000
Did you know that
he was murdered?

272
00:10:10,044 --> 00:10:14,222
No, but it's nice to get
good news for a change.

273
00:10:15,702 --> 00:10:16,920
The admin office said
that you were gone

274
00:10:16,964 --> 00:10:18,400
for a few hours
last night

275
00:10:18,443 --> 00:10:20,315
during the time
of Kevin's murder.

276
00:10:20,358 --> 00:10:22,317
So, would you like to
tell us where you were?

277
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,363
I went for a drive.
We're not prisoners here.

278
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,800
Can anyone confirm that?

279
00:10:26,843 --> 00:10:30,760
If producing nine legal shows
taught me anything,

280
00:10:30,804 --> 00:10:34,372
it's that I don't have to
say jack without a lawyer.

281
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:38,289
If you'll excuse me
while I go take a crap.

282
00:10:39,726 --> 00:10:40,683
What are you doing?Actually,

283
00:10:40,727 --> 00:10:42,380
Phil, I've had enough
of your crap!

284
00:10:42,424 --> 00:10:44,556
Now, I know that you
killed Kevin Winstead,

285
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,384
and then an angel interrupted
your escape.

286
00:10:46,428 --> 00:10:47,690
So, tell me,
what did he look like?

287
00:10:47,734 --> 00:10:48,822
Lucifer.Man, what the hell

288
00:10:48,865 --> 00:10:49,866
are you talking about, man?

289
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:52,347
Did he look like me?!

290
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,522
Lucifer, stop.

291
00:10:53,565 --> 00:10:54,741
I did not kill Kevin.

292
00:10:54,784 --> 00:10:56,003
[panting]

293
00:10:56,917 --> 00:10:59,049
But you guys
did fight, right?

294
00:10:59,093 --> 00:11:02,574
That is only 'cause Kevin took
this rehab stuff so seriously.

295
00:11:02,618 --> 00:11:04,620
The rest of us?
It's a smoke screen.

296
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,274
Keep our wives and jobs at bay.

297
00:11:06,317 --> 00:11:08,580
But Kevin wouldn't
shut up about

298
00:11:08,624 --> 00:11:11,801
getting clean,
getting his family back.

299
00:11:11,845 --> 00:11:13,150
He drove me nuts.

300
00:11:13,194 --> 00:11:14,586
So I punched him.

301
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,979
Get his family back?

302
00:11:16,023 --> 00:11:17,938
I... His parents are dead,
and he wasn't married.

303
00:11:17,981 --> 00:11:19,896
I don't know about any of that.

304
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,289
Where were you last night?

305
00:11:21,332 --> 00:11:22,290
Answer her.

306
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,378
Uh, uh...

307
00:11:23,421 --> 00:11:24,466
Uh, with hookers.

308
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,557
That's why I'm in here.

309
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,732
I'm a sex addict.

310
00:11:29,776 --> 00:11:30,864
[chuckles]

311
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:32,430
CHLOE: Ah.It's court-ordered.

312
00:11:32,474 --> 00:11:33,910
Anyway, you know,

313
00:11:33,954 --> 00:11:35,912
two steps forward,

314
00:11:35,956 --> 00:11:38,915
one step back, right?

315
00:11:41,483 --> 00:11:42,789
Hey, what was that about?

316
00:11:42,832 --> 00:11:44,616
It's nothing.

317
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,748
That was not nothing.

318
00:11:45,792 --> 00:11:46,967
Talk to me.

319
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,751
Look, I just haven't
been sleeping well.

320
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:50,666
That's all-- but never mind
that, what's next?

321
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,842
What's next is you
take the afternoon off.

322
00:11:52,886 --> 00:11:54,104
Get some rest.

323
00:11:54,148 --> 00:11:55,758
What? I'd rather go
and find the killer.

324
00:11:55,802 --> 00:11:57,194
It's not a suggestion,
Lucifer.

325
00:11:57,238 --> 00:11:59,066
Look, I'm gonna spend
the rest of the day

326
00:11:59,109 --> 00:12:00,676
poring through Kevin's file,

327
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,199
trying to figure out
who his family is.

328
00:12:02,243 --> 00:12:04,114
We probably won't know anything
until tomorrow morning.

329
00:12:04,158 --> 00:12:05,246
Tomorrow?

330
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:07,204
Go home. You're tired.

331
00:12:07,248 --> 00:12:11,643
Okay. Fine. But,
only if I can borrow these.

332
00:12:12,862 --> 00:12:14,124
Well, I promise
I'll bring them back.

333
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:15,778
Please don't.

334
00:12:15,822 --> 00:12:17,301
Ew.

335
00:12:18,955 --> 00:12:21,349

No offense, brother,
but on the list of things

I'd like to wake up to,
your face falls somewhere

00:12:58,734 --> 00:13:00,518
I just came to show you this.

Sort of flew in like..."
This is ludicrous.

357
00:13:26,066 --> 00:13:27,545
It-it can't be me.

358
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:28,677
Can it?

359
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,721
Luci.

360
00:13:29,765 --> 00:13:31,027
Just look around.

361
00:13:31,071 --> 00:13:32,594
Look at your hands.

362
00:13:32,637 --> 00:13:34,901
I think it is you,
and I think it's all my fault.

363
00:13:34,944 --> 00:13:37,077
In what possible way
is this your fault?

364
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,079
Because I made you show
your wings to Charlotte.

365
00:13:39,122 --> 00:13:40,341
Reveal divinity.

366
00:13:40,384 --> 00:13:41,908
And now, Father
is punishing us for it.

367
00:13:41,951 --> 00:13:43,953
Look, Father making
me do angelic deeds

368
00:13:43,997 --> 00:13:46,086
is a divine kick
in the nuts to me.

369
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:48,175
Well, my punishment
must be forthcoming.

370
00:13:48,218 --> 00:13:49,263
What?And who knows

371
00:13:49,306 --> 00:13:50,786
in what form it will come.

372
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,049
Don't be ridiculous.
You or I aren't being punished

373
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:55,660
for Charlotte Richards,
same as I wasn't punished

374
00:13:55,704 --> 00:13:57,097
for revealing myself to Linda.

375
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,925
Okay, well, then,
how do you explain all of this?

376
00:13:58,968 --> 00:14:00,274
Well, it's obvious, isn't it?

377
00:14:00,317 --> 00:14:02,406
It's just more manipulation.

378
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,408
Quite possibly, Dad's master
plan all along. I mean,

379
00:14:04,452 --> 00:14:07,063
first, he makes me look
the part of an angel.

380
00:14:07,107 --> 00:14:09,544
And then, he forces me
to act it in my sleep.

381
00:14:09,587 --> 00:14:11,241
I don't know, Luci.

382
00:14:11,285 --> 00:14:13,026
Well, if working
with the detective

383
00:14:13,069 --> 00:14:15,245
has taught me anything,
it's that I need proof.

384
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:17,813
Only the killer can say
for certain if it was me.

385
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,119
So I'm off to work.

386
00:14:22,122 --> 00:14:24,298
Might have a shower
and stuff first, huh?Yeah.

387
00:14:24,341 --> 00:14:27,910
I'll get some takeout, because
being with you is the dessert.

388
00:14:27,954 --> 00:14:29,259
It's a date.

389
00:14:29,303 --> 00:14:30,565

392
00:14:35,178 --> 00:14:37,746
Long enough to hear
how totally adorbs that was.

393
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:39,922
Sounds like things
are going really well.

394
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:41,489
They are. But...

395
00:14:41,532 --> 00:14:42,794
But...

396
00:14:42,838 --> 00:14:44,100
There's a "but" in there.

397
00:14:44,144 --> 00:14:45,928
I think she's holding back.

398
00:14:45,972 --> 00:14:48,452
She hasn't said the magic words.

399
00:14:48,496 --> 00:14:49,453
What magic words?

400
00:14:49,497 --> 00:14:50,933
You know.

401
00:14:50,977 --> 00:14:52,674
Those three little words.

402
00:14:53,805 --> 00:14:56,417
Rhymes with "my guv boo."

403
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,462
She hasn't said them, yeah.

we fall really hard.

408

But don't worry, LT.

she'll say them.

Oh, Charlotte.

424
00:15:41,897 --> 00:15:43,464
It's not the clothes
that make you look fat.

425
00:15:43,507 --> 00:15:44,682
It's the fat.

426
00:15:44,726 --> 00:15:45,857
Ugh.
Yeah.

427
00:15:45,901 --> 00:15:47,555
Oof. And you.

Uh, thanks?

431
00:15:56,607 --> 00:15:59,045
And you.

432
00:15:59,088 --> 00:16:02,004
You are coming with me.

433
00:16:02,048 --> 00:16:03,179
Okay.

434

CHLOE: Mrs. Bell,
this is a copy

435
00:16:09,229 --> 00:16:10,665
of your son's birth certificate.

436
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,884
It says that Kevin Winstead
is the father.

437
00:16:12,928 --> 00:16:14,930
Kevin and I dated years ago.

438
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,236
We were going
to get married

439
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:18,716
after I got pregnant
with Jackson.

440
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,675
But I called it off
at the last minute.

441
00:16:20,718 --> 00:16:21,763
[Jackson screams]

00:16:21,806 --> 00:16:24,418

Jackson, stop.Oh, no, no, no!

00:16:24,461 --> 00:16:25,897
No, no.
JACKSON:
No, no, no!

444
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:27,377
NANNY: Get off
the floor.
I got it.

445
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:29,597
Yeah, and people choose
to procreate.

446
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,381
I'm afraid my son
has Kevin's temper.

447
00:16:31,425 --> 00:16:32,426
But you are

448
00:16:32,469 --> 00:16:34,906
the one with
the assault charges.

449
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,821
I did my share
of drugs with Kevin.

450
00:16:36,865 --> 00:16:38,258
I'm not proud of
who I was then.

451
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:39,389
LUCIFER:
Right.

452
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:41,217
The drugs made you wild.

453
00:16:41,261 --> 00:16:44,046
Which is why I stopped using.

454
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:47,049
But Kevin liked getting high
more than he loved me.

455
00:16:47,093 --> 00:16:49,747
Our relationship
became toxic.

456
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:50,922
So I left.

457
00:16:50,966 --> 00:16:52,402
CHLOE:
And when was the last time

458
00:16:52,446 --> 00:16:53,795
you spoke to Kevin?It's been years.

459
00:16:53,838 --> 00:16:56,058
'Cause it says here
on the phone records

460
00:16:56,102 --> 00:16:57,929
that he called here
three months ago?

461
00:16:57,973 --> 00:16:59,931
Every now and then,
he would call, asking for money.

462
00:16:59,975 --> 00:17:01,542
For drugs.
So, whenever I would see

463
00:17:01,585 --> 00:17:02,891
his name on the caller I.D.,

464
00:17:02,934 --> 00:17:04,806
I would just hand
the phone to Jeremy.

465
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:07,417
And did Kevin mention having
trouble with anyone?

466
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:08,592
A drug dealer, maybe?

467
00:17:08,636 --> 00:17:09,680
Last time we spoke, he said

468
00:17:09,724 --> 00:17:10,942
he owed somebody a lot of money.

469
00:17:10,986 --> 00:17:12,640
I didn't care
to ask who.

470
00:17:12,683 --> 00:17:15,860
Right. Well, I'm not saying this
was a complete waste of time,

471
00:17:15,904 --> 00:17:18,472
but... it was.

Aren't you worried
about the fallout?

480
00:17:40,189 --> 00:17:43,540

changed my perspective on...

481
00:17:43,584 --> 00:17:44,933
well, everything.

482
00:17:44,976 --> 00:17:46,674
It's liberating.

I don't care who I have to hurt,

711
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,463
as long as it allows me
to finally die.

712
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,862
"No family? No friends?
No problem."

713
00:26:42,905 --> 00:26:44,385
And for a fee,
they'll send actors

714
00:26:44,428 --> 00:26:47,954
to pose as family or friends

715
00:26:47,997 --> 00:26:50,826
at public functions
for the sake of appearances.

716
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:51,871
That's clever.Yeah, well,

717
00:26:51,914 --> 00:26:53,307
it's creepy.

718
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,917
At least now we know
that whoever hired

719
00:26:54,961 --> 00:26:56,876
that exceptionally talented
actor from Bones

720
00:26:56,919 --> 00:26:59,966
may well be our killer. Hmm?

721
00:27:00,009 --> 00:27:02,359
So, um...
It says, says here

722
00:27:02,403 --> 00:27:04,971
the Masquerade office
is in Hollywood. I'm driving.

723
00:27:05,014 --> 00:27:07,538
Lucifer.

724
00:27:07,582 --> 00:27:10,063
I won't be able to get a warrant
until tomorrow morning.

725
00:27:10,106 --> 00:27:11,586
No. No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

726
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,414
It-it is imperative
that we go now.

727
00:27:13,457 --> 00:27:15,242
It's imperative that you sleep.

728
00:27:15,285 --> 00:27:16,809
You clearly...

729
00:27:16,852 --> 00:27:18,245
I can't sleep!

730
00:27:21,596 --> 00:27:23,076
Detective, I can't sleep.

731
00:27:33,913 --> 00:27:35,741
[sighs]

732
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:38,526
Lucifer.

733
00:27:40,049 --> 00:27:42,878
I've had it.What-- you won't
understand, really.

734
00:27:42,922 --> 00:27:45,533
Hmm?It's my wings. They're back.

735
00:27:45,576 --> 00:27:46,882
My Father, he's manipulating me.

736
00:27:46,926 --> 00:27:48,928
He's making me do things
that I would never do.

737
00:27:48,971 --> 00:27:50,799
What? Like flying
through the night,

738
00:27:50,843 --> 00:27:52,540
helping people
like some rogue angel?

739
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:53,889
Yes! Yes, exactly!Uh-huh.

740
00:27:53,933 --> 00:27:56,718
That is the only
plausible explanation. [laughs]

741
00:27:56,762 --> 00:27:58,764
Either that or Linda's right,
and I'm suppressing

742
00:27:58,807 --> 00:28:01,462
pent-up feelings
about you and Pierce,

743
00:28:01,505 --> 00:28:03,725
which is obviously absurd.

744
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:05,727
You hate that I'm with him.

745
00:28:05,771 --> 00:28:08,556
I couldn't care less that you're
with that insolent dullard.

746
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:10,036
We both know that's not true,

747
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:13,474
but what I want to know is why
it bothers you so much.

748
00:28:13,517 --> 00:28:17,739
Because, Detective, I happen
to know him better than you,

749
00:28:17,783 --> 00:28:19,741
and I know that
you can't trust him.

750
00:28:19,785 --> 00:28:21,090
Care to elaborate on that?

751
00:28:21,134 --> 00:28:23,440
I... Yeah.

752
00:28:23,484 --> 00:28:26,269
Fine, I will, because you
deserve to know the truth.Yes.

753
00:28:26,313 --> 00:28:28,054
Yes, okay.

754
00:28:28,097 --> 00:28:30,012
Pierce isn't Pierce.

755
00:28:30,056 --> 00:28:31,884
He's Kane from the Bible.

756
00:28:31,927 --> 00:28:33,624
And he's immortal.
He's been around for eons.

757
00:28:33,668 --> 00:28:35,539
And all he cares about
is ridding himself

758
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:38,412
of that stupid curse
that my Father put on him...Stop.

759
00:28:38,455 --> 00:28:40,936
...because he killed
his brother.
Stop!

760
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,460
You're tired, and you're
not thinking clearly.No...

761
00:28:43,504 --> 00:28:45,941
No, I'm-- it's not because
I'm tired, Detective!And...

762
00:28:45,985 --> 00:28:49,771
But since you
brought it up,

763
00:28:49,815 --> 00:28:54,297
let me tell you what
I think about Marcus.

764
00:28:54,341 --> 00:28:57,910
He is a good man

765
00:28:57,953 --> 00:28:59,302
who treats me right.

766
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,437
And I'm happy, Lucifer.

767
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,875
And all I know is how I feel
when I'm around him,

768
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:09,095
and, you know, I l...

769
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,619
I...

770
00:29:13,142 --> 00:29:15,754
We're done here.

771
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:24,545
SALESMAN:
Seven carats

772
00:29:24,588 --> 00:29:26,677
of pure bliss.

773
00:29:26,721 --> 00:29:29,985
Don't you deserve
a little indulgence?

774
00:29:30,029 --> 00:29:31,160
I'll take it.

775
00:29:31,204 --> 00:29:33,336
[knock on door]Hey.

776
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,642
You got a second?

777
00:29:34,685 --> 00:29:36,992
For you, Amenadiel, always.

778
00:29:37,036 --> 00:29:39,473
Don't go too far.

779
00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:46,567
Dan called me.
He's worried about you.

780
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:50,310
Well, all is good.
In fact, it's better than good.

781
00:29:50,353 --> 00:29:51,659
It's perfect.

782
00:29:51,702 --> 00:29:54,009
Yeah, what about that
Spartan lifestyle?

783
00:29:54,053 --> 00:29:57,012
What can I say? Things change.

784
00:29:57,056 --> 00:29:58,405
And why is that?

785
00:29:58,448 --> 00:30:02,322
Because when you know
a pair of angels that can

786
00:30:02,365 --> 00:30:04,541
zip you up to Heaven
when the time comes,

787
00:30:04,585 --> 00:30:06,239
worrying is a waste of time.

788
00:30:10,547 --> 00:30:12,723
That's not how it works,
Charlotte.

789
00:30:12,767 --> 00:30:15,378
What do you mean?Okay, look.

790
00:30:15,422 --> 00:30:19,382
Neither I nor Lucifer have the
power to get anyone into Heaven.

791
00:30:19,426 --> 00:30:21,341
I don't have my wings,

792
00:30:21,384 --> 00:30:23,996
and Lucifer, well,

793
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:26,389
he is, uh, most unwelcome.

794
00:30:26,433 --> 00:30:27,869
So the only thing
that matters,

795
00:30:27,913 --> 00:30:30,350
Charlotte, truly,
is who you are.

796
00:30:30,393 --> 00:30:32,874
It's okay.

797
00:30:32,918 --> 00:30:34,397
Nothing's changed.

798
00:30:34,441 --> 00:30:37,879
No, don't you see?
That's the problem.

799
00:30:37,923 --> 00:30:40,534
The second I thought
I had a free pass,

800
00:30:40,577 --> 00:30:42,753
an excuse not to be good,

801
00:30:42,797 --> 00:30:47,149
I relapsed into my old ways,

802
00:30:47,193 --> 00:30:49,630
into who I really am.

803
00:30:54,635 --> 00:30:57,029
There's no hope for me.

804
00:30:57,072 --> 00:30:59,553
Amenadiel, I can't change.

805
00:31:02,643 --> 00:31:05,646
I'm going to Hell.

806
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:09,563
[gasps]

807
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:18,572
Mommy.
CHLOE:
Hmm?

808
00:31:18,615 --> 00:31:20,443
Did you know if you're
ever mean to me,

809
00:31:20,487 --> 00:31:22,924
I can just go on this site
and order a new mommy?

810
00:31:22,968 --> 00:31:25,144
Oh, yeah? How you
gonna pay for that?

811
00:31:25,187 --> 00:31:26,580
Your credit card.

812
00:31:26,623 --> 00:31:29,278
I've gotten pretty good
at your signature, you know.

813
00:31:29,322 --> 00:31:31,802
I don't doubt that.
All right, come on.

814
00:31:31,846 --> 00:31:33,587
Let's go get some
pizza and ice cream

815
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:34,805
on the way home.

816
00:31:34,849 --> 00:31:35,981
[mouthing]

817
00:31:37,156 --> 00:31:38,113
He seems nice.

818
00:31:38,157 --> 00:31:41,856
He is nice. You know, Monkey,

819
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,684
since Daddy,

820
00:31:43,727 --> 00:31:48,254
I haven't really dated anyone...
well, seriously.

821
00:31:48,297 --> 00:31:49,342
And, uh...

822
00:31:49,385 --> 00:31:50,952
Marcus and I,

823
00:31:50,996 --> 00:31:53,781
we've been spending
a lot of time together.

824
00:31:53,824 --> 00:31:57,350
And the truth is...
I like him, a lot.

825
00:31:57,393 --> 00:32:01,267
And it's just so important to me
that you're okay with that.

826
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:03,356
Is he the reason
you've been so happy lately?

827
00:32:06,315 --> 00:32:07,838
I think so.

828
00:32:07,882 --> 00:32:10,319
Does he like chocolate cake?

829
00:32:10,363 --> 00:32:11,842
You know what,
I don't know.

830
00:32:11,886 --> 00:32:13,235
Let's ask him.

831
00:32:15,281 --> 00:32:16,891
All right.
[clears throat]

832
00:32:18,893 --> 00:32:20,025
Oh, my God.

833
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,637
What is it, Mommy?

834
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,334
That's Jeremy Bell.

835
00:32:25,378 --> 00:32:27,989
The husband we interviewed.

836
00:32:28,033 --> 00:32:30,035
Hello?

837
00:32:32,385 --> 00:32:34,865
[wind whistling]

838
00:32:34,909 --> 00:32:38,478
Anyone there?

839
00:32:46,616 --> 00:32:49,228
LUCIFER:
Trouble sleeping?

840
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,240
Mr. Morningstar,
what are you doing here?

841
00:33:01,283 --> 00:33:04,373
Shh. It's probably best
not to wake your family.

842
00:33:04,417 --> 00:33:08,029
Even though...

843
00:33:08,073 --> 00:33:09,683
they're not your family.

844
00:33:09,726 --> 00:33:11,206
I just came
from Masquerade

845
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:14,122
where a most cooperative
employee

846
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:16,559
helped me connect the dots.

847
00:33:16,603 --> 00:33:19,562
So, you used to be an actor.

848
00:33:19,606 --> 00:33:21,695
We're in L.A., everybody
used to be an actor.

849
00:33:21,738 --> 00:33:24,698
Mm-hmm, but not everyone gets
such a cushy gig, do they?

850
00:33:24,741 --> 00:33:26,004
Your so-called wife

851
00:33:26,047 --> 00:33:29,790
worried she'd no longer
fit in with the classes

852
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:33,272
after she broke it off
with her deadbeat baby daddy,

853
00:33:33,315 --> 00:33:36,101
hired you to play
husband and father.

854
00:33:36,144 --> 00:33:38,886
Murdering to keep the gig?

855
00:33:38,929 --> 00:33:40,975
That seems a tad method,
don't you think?

856
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,107
Murder?

857
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,934
Th-That's crazy.

858
00:33:43,978 --> 00:33:45,371
All right, look,
you need to leave

859
00:33:45,414 --> 00:33:46,546
or I'm gonna call the police.

860
00:33:46,589 --> 00:33:48,939
Oh, please.
Spare me the theatrics

861
00:33:48,983 --> 00:33:50,593
because I am in no mood

862
00:33:50,637 --> 00:33:52,769
to hear the half-baked
recitation of innocence

863
00:33:52,813 --> 00:33:56,121
by a, well, mediocre actor.

864
00:34:02,431 --> 00:34:04,303
Was it mediocre acting

865
00:34:04,346 --> 00:34:07,436
that got Mary to actually
fall in love with me?

866
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,091
And Kevin's reappearance
just put all that in jeopardy.

867
00:34:10,135 --> 00:34:11,919
Yeah, I wasn't about
to let that loser

868
00:34:11,962 --> 00:34:14,487
weasel his way back in here.

869
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:16,837
Just like I'm not gonna let you
mess it up, either.

870
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,622
[chuckles]Too bad you're trespassing.

871
00:34:19,666 --> 00:34:21,059
[grunts]

872
00:34:22,321 --> 00:34:23,757
What the hell?

873
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,193
Most kind of you
to admit your guilt.

874
00:34:25,237 --> 00:34:26,629
The trying to kill me part,
less so.

875
00:34:26,673 --> 00:34:28,022
Aah!

876
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,938
Now, tell me what
I really want to know.

877
00:34:30,981 --> 00:34:33,767
Am I the angel?
What angel?!

878
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:35,160
Did I stop you
from killing that old woman?

879
00:34:35,203 --> 00:34:37,249
What happened the night
you killed Kevin?!

880
00:34:37,292 --> 00:34:38,815
Okay. I'll tell you.

881
00:34:38,859 --> 00:34:39,816
After I shot him, I ran out.

882
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,644
I bumped into that old lady.

883
00:34:41,688 --> 00:34:43,472
But there was
nobody else there.

884
00:34:43,516 --> 00:34:45,648
She fell into some kind of
religious trance so I bolted!

885
00:34:45,692 --> 00:34:46,649
She saw an angel!

886
00:34:46,693 --> 00:34:49,130
Was it me?!
No! I...

887
00:34:49,174 --> 00:34:52,133
It was a-a shadow
from-from those figurines.

888
00:34:52,177 --> 00:34:54,135
With the figurines, the angel
figurines. Did you plant

889
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:55,180
the figurine
in my bedroom?!
No, no.

890
00:34:55,223 --> 00:34:56,877
I-I touched one of them.

891
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,271
So I took it, but it had
my prints on it.

892
00:34:59,314 --> 00:35:00,663
I destroyed it right
after. I swear.

893
00:35:00,707 --> 00:35:03,840
Then... how...

894
00:35:03,884 --> 00:35:05,015
[grunts]

895
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:10,543
I was only trying
to protect my family.

896
00:35:10,586 --> 00:35:13,328
It was never your family
to protect,

897
00:35:13,372 --> 00:35:15,069
you pathetic imposter.

898
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,201
You stole it

899
00:35:16,244 --> 00:35:17,985
from Kevin Winstead.

900
00:35:18,028 --> 00:35:20,379
And then you kept him distracted

901
00:35:20,422 --> 00:35:22,859
by hiring someone
to keep the party going.

902
00:35:22,903 --> 00:35:25,384
Driving him
to self-destruction,

903
00:35:25,427 --> 00:35:29,910
stoking the very fires
of his own weakness...

904
00:35:31,564 --> 00:35:33,131
...to keep him out of the way.

905
00:35:34,393 --> 00:35:36,090
How could I be so blind?

906
00:35:47,928 --> 00:35:50,409
Jeremy Bell? LAPD.

907
00:35:54,413 --> 00:35:56,763
It's all my fault.

908
00:35:57,938 --> 00:35:59,722
I killed Kevin Winstead.

909
00:36:01,942 --> 00:36:03,596
I am a pathetic imposter.

910
00:36:12,257 --> 00:36:13,345
[elevator bell dings]

911
00:36:15,608 --> 00:36:17,218
What are you doing?

912
00:36:17,262 --> 00:36:18,567
I need to find it, Maze.

913
00:36:18,611 --> 00:36:20,134
Find what?

914
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,440
Your self-respect?

915
00:36:21,483 --> 00:36:23,746
The-the angel figurine.
It's here somewhere.

916
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:26,053
I-I need to find it
so that I can

917
00:36:26,096 --> 00:36:28,838
convince the detective
that Pierce...

918
00:36:28,882 --> 00:36:30,710
isn't who she thinks he is.

919
00:36:30,753 --> 00:36:32,625
What? I don't understand.
Explain.

920
00:36:32,668 --> 00:36:34,540
I figured it out, haven't I?

921
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:36,846
Pierce has been
gaslighting me.

922
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,065
He's been tricking me
into thinking

923
00:36:38,108 --> 00:36:40,763
I've been doing good deeds
in my sleep.

924
00:36:40,807 --> 00:36:41,895
Why would he do that?

925
00:36:41,938 --> 00:36:43,505
Because...

926
00:36:43,549 --> 00:36:44,898
to keep me away
from the detective

927
00:36:44,941 --> 00:36:46,900
so he can pursue her.

928
00:36:46,943 --> 00:36:48,815
He must be back to thinking
that she's the key to lifting

929
00:36:48,858 --> 00:36:50,077
his bloody curse.

930
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,121
I mean, I tried to warn her,

931
00:36:51,165 --> 00:36:53,123
but she wouldn't
listen, would she?

932
00:36:53,167 --> 00:36:54,516
And why wouldn't she listen?

933
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,257
Because the detective
always needs proof.

934
00:36:56,301 --> 00:36:58,912
And what better proof than
that trinket that he used

935
00:36:58,955 --> 00:37:01,480
to-to-to deceive me?

936
00:37:02,655 --> 00:37:03,960
[laughs]

937
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,485
Wait.

938
00:37:08,313 --> 00:37:09,314
If you want Chloe
to believe you,

939
00:37:09,357 --> 00:37:12,273
you have to do it right.

940
00:37:12,317 --> 00:37:14,797
Take it to Ellen.
Have her do her lab thingy.

941
00:37:14,841 --> 00:37:16,321
Yes, yes, you're right.

942
00:37:16,364 --> 00:37:19,802
First, back up.
Tell me everything.

943
00:37:19,846 --> 00:37:21,848
Start at the beginning.

944
00:37:21,891 --> 00:37:23,458
And don't leave
a single thing out.

945
00:37:23,502 --> 00:37:26,156
It's just...

946
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:30,160
so hard to put everything
together in my mind, Maze.

947
00:37:30,204 --> 00:37:31,510
I mean, you-you
wouldn't understand.

948
00:37:32,641 --> 00:37:33,642
Thank you.

949
00:37:33,686 --> 00:37:34,774
That's very kind of you.

950
00:37:40,388 --> 00:37:43,478
Which is not like you at all.

951
00:37:43,522 --> 00:37:44,784
Why are you even here?

952
00:37:46,046 --> 00:37:49,005
You're helping him.
Aren't you?

953
00:37:49,049 --> 00:37:51,878
"Helping him"?

954
00:37:51,921 --> 00:37:54,533
This was myidea.

955
00:37:55,708 --> 00:37:58,493
After Pierce told me

956
00:37:58,537 --> 00:38:00,974
about that old lady who
thought she saw an angel,

957
00:38:01,017 --> 00:38:04,369
that's when it all
came together.

958
00:38:06,371 --> 00:38:11,419
I planted the figurine
by your bed.

959
00:38:11,463 --> 00:38:16,685
My neck... is still jacked
from wearing those fake wings

960
00:38:16,729 --> 00:38:17,860
to save that dumb family

961
00:38:17,904 --> 00:38:19,558
in San Bernardino.

962
00:38:19,601 --> 00:38:23,039
You came this close
the other night to waking up

963
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:25,041
after I took those
handcuffs off.

964
00:38:25,085 --> 00:38:28,349
Thankfully, handcuffs in bed,
I got that.

965
00:38:28,393 --> 00:38:30,917
Why would you do this to me,
Mazikeen?

966
00:38:32,919 --> 00:38:35,182
Because I know
the only thing

967
00:38:35,225 --> 00:38:37,315
that matters to you
more than Chloe.

968
00:38:38,403 --> 00:38:40,709
You.
