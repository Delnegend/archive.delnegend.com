1
00:00:01,135 --> 00:00:03,104
Previously, on Lucifer...

2
00:00:03,137 --> 00:00:05,739
Doctor, someone is forcing
those wings on me.

3
00:00:05,773 --> 00:00:06,974
They took away my devil face.

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,677
I won't stand for someone
making me something I'm not.

5
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:10,678
LINDA:
But your wings,

6
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:11,845
they grew back?
They did.

7
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:14,215
Look, if you're upset
about what the lieutenant said,

8
00:00:14,248 --> 00:00:16,517
you're not alone--
he's not a fan of mine, either.

9
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,320
And I still can't believe he
called me "Lucifer's partner."

10
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,255
AMENADIEL: And even though
he doesn't realize it,

11
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:24,392
everything he does
seems designed to hurt me.

12
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:25,459
To test you?

13
00:00:25,493 --> 00:00:26,794
My test is Lucifer.

14
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:29,130
It's always been Lucifer.

15
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:31,099
I'm Lucifer
bloody Morningstar.

16
00:00:31,132 --> 00:00:33,501
I do favors better
than anyone else.

17
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:34,502
Or at least I used to.

18
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,104
And I think that maybe

19
00:00:36,137 --> 00:00:39,073
it's about time
I got back in the game.

20
00:00:40,174 --> 00:00:41,509
("Chainsmoking" playing)

21
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,344
(chuckles softly)

22
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:48,682
So, tell me, what's
your deepest, darkest fantasy?

23
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:53,254
To have sex in the ball pit
at a Chuck E. Cheese.

24
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:54,522
(laughs)

25
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:56,424
Not what I was expecting.
I mean,

26
00:00:56,457 --> 00:00:59,560
the thought of getting caught,
it just turns me on.

27
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:02,096
All right, well, I'd rather
eat a plate of warm mayonnaise

28
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,732
than visit that child-laden
cesspool, but, um...

29
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:06,734
you are a
persuasive one,

30
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:08,702
aren't you?
(laughs):
Yay.

31
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:10,838
Ooh, let's practice.

32
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:11,672
Why not?

33
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:13,841
(laughing, moaning)

34
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:15,543
MAN (calls):
Lexy, darling?

35
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:16,777
I'm home.
Oh, no.

36
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,279
No, no, no, no, no.

37
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:20,181
He's not supposed to be
back until tomorrow.

38
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:21,582
(whimpers)

39
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:23,584
Quick. Hide.

40
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:24,818
Lexy.

41
00:01:24,852 --> 00:01:27,221
Relax.

42
00:01:27,255 --> 00:01:28,756
I'll handle this.
(exhales)

43
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:32,560
* I'm begging you
for more, ah, ah *

44
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,662
* Chainsmoking your love...

45
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:36,197
What the hell?

46
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,466
Rest easy.
I'm not a thief.

47
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:41,502
Your valuables
are untouched--
unless, of course,

48
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:42,536
you consider your wife
a valuable.

49
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,772
In that case,
I've touched her several times.

50
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:46,574
(chuckles)
Twice this morning.

51
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:50,110
Who the hell do you
think you are?

52
00:01:51,412 --> 00:01:53,881
Lucifer Morningstar, Your Honor.

53
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:57,585
My apologies. I had no idea
I was dealing with a man

54
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,753
of such stature.
In my defense,

55
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:00,854
when we came in last night,

56
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:04,325
I was blindfolded
by your wife's underwear, so...

57
00:02:06,694 --> 00:02:08,362
You're messin'
with the wrong guy, pal.

58
00:02:08,396 --> 00:02:10,764
Ah, violence-- now we're
getting somewhere interesting.

59
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:12,666
Come on, let it
flow. Tell me,

60
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,336
is kicking my ass
what you truly desire?

61
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,573
No.

62
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:21,875
No, I just...

63
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:25,379
I... I want a friggin' nap.

64
00:02:25,413 --> 00:02:27,615
Look, I know
I'm a cliché.

65
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:30,284
I married the yoga instructor.

66
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:33,254
But you wouldn't believe
the body on that girl.

67
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:35,523
(chuckles)
Wouldn't I?

68
00:02:35,556 --> 00:02:37,191
Right.

69
00:02:37,225 --> 00:02:38,526
So you get it.

70
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:39,927
Mm-hmm.
In the beginning,

71
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,496
it was great-- partying
all the time, there was...

72
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,631
Tons of sex.

73
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,233
You must have felt
like a new man.

74
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:47,401
But then-- let me guess--
it became...

75
00:02:47,435 --> 00:02:48,502
Exhausting.

76
00:02:48,536 --> 00:02:49,637
All of that.

77
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,839
Sex, partying,

78
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:54,475
and... Coachella.

79
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,410
Ooh.
That's not who I am.

80
00:02:56,444 --> 00:02:57,678
In all honesty,
I just...

81
00:02:57,711 --> 00:03:00,648
I just want to chill
with my ex, Marsha.

82
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,383
She engaged my mind.

83
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,918
Well, truth be told,
I've been experiencing

84
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:06,854
an identity conundrum myself.

85
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:09,790
Well, that was until I realized
that the best way

86
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:12,660
to remind myself
of the Devil I am today

87
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:15,763
is to fully embrace
the Devil I used to be.

88
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:18,466
Are you saying
I should call my ex?

89
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:19,467
Absolutely.

90
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,502
And I can help you.

91
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:22,303
How?

92
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:23,537
By graciously keeping
your new bride

93
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:27,475
sexually satisfied while you
reconnect with your old wife.

94
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:29,477
Yeah?

95
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,744
Deal?

96
00:03:30,778 --> 00:03:32,580
Uh, deal.

97
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:34,315
But don't forget...

98
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:37,451
now I've done you a favor,
you owe me one.

99
00:03:37,485 --> 00:03:39,687
Of course.

100
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,622
Wh-Whatever you want.

101
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:43,324
Lovely.

102
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:44,458
Right.

103
00:03:44,492 --> 00:03:45,526
Mm.

104
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,396
I, uh, better get on with
my end of the bargain.

105
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,998
Lexy, darling,

106
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:53,401
the Devil's back.
(chuckles)

107
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:04,945
Hey, Lieutenant.
You busy?

108
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,881
Depends what you're
gonna ask me next.

109
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:10,351
Well, uh, in an effort
to strengthen

110
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:13,354
my own professional identity
within the department,

111
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:15,923
I'd like to take on
some added responsibility.

112
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:19,960
I'd like to be put up
for the open union rep position.

113
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:24,064
Request denied.

114
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,899
Can I ask why?

115
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,868
See, one of the few benefits

116
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:30,904
of having the "L" and the "T"
in front of my name

117
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,806
is I don't have
to explain myself.

118
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:34,842
Anything else?

119
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,277
No.

120
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:40,280
Detective.

121
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,383
New body just dropped.

122
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:43,517
Since you're here,

123
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:45,353
you might as well take it.

124
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:52,860
ELLA:
Whoa.

125
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:54,495
What was that about?
(groans)

126
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:56,930
You could tell
just by watching?
Oh, my God, yeah.

127
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,932
He is so into you.

128
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:01,535
You're joking.
Uh, no.

129
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:03,771
Scorching fire. Five-alarm.

130
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,673
But all I'm gonna say.

131
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:07,575
I, uh, heard we
caught a body.

132
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:09,309
I'll grab my kit.

133
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:13,981
*

134
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:22,423
AMENADIEL:
Lucifer. Where have you been?

135
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:23,524
Saving a marriage.

136
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:25,125
Listen, I've been waiting
here to tell you that

137
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,628
I finally figured out
what my task is from Father

138
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,563
to get my powers back.
Ah? Well,

139
00:05:29,597 --> 00:05:30,964
this should be
the opposite of interesting.

140
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,433
It's you, Brother.

141
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:33,601
You...

142
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:34,802
are my task.

143
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,570
Slightly more interesting.

144
00:05:36,604 --> 00:05:38,872
How am I your task?

145
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:40,908
I have no idea.

146
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:44,011
I mean, am I supposed
to help you, teach you?

147
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:46,714
You see, I was sent down here
to be with you for a reason.

148
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:49,550
Now, maybe... maybe that means
I'm supposed to learn from you.

149
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:53,687
(exhales)
Well, if you really need
to understand me, Brother,

150
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:55,823
then you must first...

151
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,859
walk a mile
in my Italian loafers.

152
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:00,728
Walk a mile in your shoes?

153
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:01,862
Mm-hmm.

154
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:03,797
All right.

155
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:05,799
Well, tell me how to...

156
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,835
"Lucifer."
Oh, baby steps.

157
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,003
It took eons to perfect this.

158
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:13,607
All right, first off,
a... a makeover.

159
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:15,609
Clothes.

160
00:06:15,643 --> 00:06:17,144
(chuckles):
Shoes.

161
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:19,613
Here's an idea:
try smiling.

162
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,048
Right.

163
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:21,982
We can work on that.

164
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:24,518
Through there, my closet,
I grant you...

165
00:06:24,552 --> 00:06:25,819
entrée to all things me.

166
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:27,187
And give me your phone.

167
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,022
Okay.

168
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,291
Right.

169
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:34,161
Now you have access
to all my social media accounts:

170
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:36,163
Instagram, Snapchat, Grindr.

171
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:37,030
Go.

172
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,499
Release your inner Devil.

173
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:40,033
But what should
I do first?

174
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,802
Oh, I don't know.

175
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:43,637
Get laid. Play the piano.

176
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:45,172
Punish evil.

177
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:47,875
Just, whenever you're faced
with a choice,

178
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:51,111
ask yourself
the question: WWLD?

179
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:55,683
What Would Lucifer Do?

180
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:57,785
*

181
00:06:57,818 --> 00:06:59,787
* Oh oh oh *

182
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,523
* Whoa, oh oh oh *
* You won't believe me *

183
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:04,925
* Na na na *
* If I told you

184
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,461
* Oh, oh *
* Na, na, na *

185
00:07:07,495 --> 00:07:08,996
* Oh, oh *

186
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,631
* Na, na, na *

187
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:12,800
* Oh, oh, oh *

188
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,668
* You won't believe me *

189
00:07:14,702 --> 00:07:16,470
* If I told you.

190
00:07:16,504 --> 00:07:19,573
Hey. Got an ID?

191
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:20,641
(shutter clicks)

192
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:22,710
Yep. Meet Emily Goddard.

193
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:24,612
(shutter clicks)
23.

194
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:25,813
Counselor here.

195
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:27,548
Body was found in the trough.

196
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:30,518
"Firehawk Ranch.
Transformational Center."

197
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:32,219
Yeah, it's a high-end
reform program

198
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:34,588
for juvenile
drug offenders and addicts.

199
00:07:34,622 --> 00:07:35,556
LUCIFER:
Oh.

200
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:36,690
Really?

201
00:07:36,724 --> 00:07:37,825
So, what, she drown?

202
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:38,859
No.

203
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:40,127
Stabbed.

204
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,662
In her office, upstairs.

205
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:42,930
Then took a tumble

206
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:43,931
out the window,
and...

207
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,232
splashdown.

208
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:47,868
(sighs)
We have a murder weapon?

209
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:50,237
(shutter clicks)
Nothing yet.

210
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:53,574
But... from the depth
of the wound,

211
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:56,143
blunting on one side...

212
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:58,746
I'd say we're looking
for either a knife

213
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:00,180
or a tool with a...

214
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,249
four- to five-inch
serrated blade.

215
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:05,252
So this, uh, so-called
"reform program,"

216
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:08,221
it claims to transform
bad kids into good ones?

217
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:10,724
Only reform program
I ever knew was

218
00:08:10,758 --> 00:08:11,859
my abuelita's boot.

219
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:12,960
It was pretty effective.

220
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:13,994
I'm sure.

221
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:16,029
Oh, there's
the guy in charge.

222
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:17,264
CHLOE:
Hi.

223
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:19,600
Detective Chloe Decker.
And he is...

224
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:20,534
Very skeptical.

225
00:08:20,568 --> 00:08:24,071
Jerry Blackcrow--
founder of Firehawk Ranch.

226
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:26,273
This is terrible.
Do you know anyone

227
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:28,075
who may have wanted
to hurt Ms. Goddard?

228
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:30,744
No. She was one
of my best counselors.

229
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:33,881
Everyone adored her.

230
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:36,617
Any idea what
happened, then?

231
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,886
Someone must have snuck
onto the property and done this.

232
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,287
(laughs)

233
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,354
Well, we're surrounded
by ne'er-do-wells,

234
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:44,658
and he thinks the culprit
came from the outside.

235
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:45,759
Delusional.

236
00:08:45,793 --> 00:08:47,561
Killer's
obviously here.

237
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:48,361
Probably him.

238
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:51,198
Shifty eyes.
Or-- no, sorry-- her.

239
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:52,399
The ginger--
she's got

240
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:54,735
that "I like to watch the life
drain out of people" look.

241
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:57,104
Okay.
Like I'm the only one
who sees it!

242
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:59,106
No way one of my kids did this.

243
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:01,141
They all walk the Firehawk Path.

244
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:02,943
This is a place
of transformation.

245
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:05,078
Uh, no.
This is a scam.

246
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:06,680
People can't
be changed.

247
00:09:06,714 --> 00:09:07,815
Trust me, I know.

248
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:10,317
Perhaps they just need
the right kind of motivation.

249
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,319
As a former addict
and ex-con,

250
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:14,221
I'm living proof
that people can change.

251
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:17,625
Our kids graduate
to better lives.

252
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:19,727
Sorry to get all interrupty,
but they just found

253
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,194
this tool belt
in the victim's office.

254
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:22,796
Looks like
an item's missing.

255
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,798
Pruning saw's gone.

256
00:09:24,832 --> 00:09:27,668
Let me guess-- four to five
inches, serrated blade?

257
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:29,937
It's our missing murder weapon.
Whose tool belt is that?

258
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,039
One of the residents.

259
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,941
Only they receive them.

260
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:36,276
Oh, well, game,
set, match moi.

261
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,145
It appears one of your pupils

262
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:41,715
has just graduated
to murder one.

263
00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:43,717
*

264
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:52,693
"Nine five four four."
We keep strict records

265
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:54,227
of all the equipment
issued to the kids.

266
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:55,696
Taking care
of your gear

267
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:56,897
is the sixth stepping stone

268
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,098
on the Firehawk Path to healing.

269
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:00,734
Ah, is stepping stone seven,
"Use said gear

270
00:10:00,768 --> 00:10:03,070
to kill someone
you hate"?

271
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,237
Uh, excuse me.

272
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:05,906
What is that?
The badge.

273
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,742
JERRY: Uh, those are
Colin's Firehawk wings.

274
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:10,310
Highest honor here.

275
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,713
(laughs):
Wings as an honor?

276
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:13,580
Is this a joke?

277
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,315
No. It's part of
the reward system.

278
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:18,251
The better the residents behave,
the more benefits they earn.

279
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:21,254
Wings are only given to those
who have truly reformed.

280
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,791
They get the most sought-after
privileges, like...

281
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:26,359
computer time, phone calls...
So, h-hold on.

282
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:29,062
You curtail the free will
of these rebellious souls

283
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:30,931
by making them follow
your rules,

284
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,132
and then you trick them
into thinking

285
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:33,934
they've changed by
giving them wings?

286
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,002
(horses neighing excitedly)

287
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:37,671
A most vile manipulation.

288
00:10:37,705 --> 00:10:39,406
And completely unoriginal,
I might add.

289
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:41,008
Lucifer...
Tyson Chase.

290
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,844
The tool belt-- it was
assigned to Tyson Chase.

291
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:45,946
(horses huffing, neighing)

292
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,215
Where can we find Tyson?

293
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:50,250
(birds singing)

294
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:02,029
Well, it appears Tyson used
his wings to fly the coop.

295
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:02,730
(sighs)

296
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:04,698
Still think people can change?

297
00:11:04,732 --> 00:11:06,399
(crowd chatter)

298
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:08,335
* Ay
* Ay *

299
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:10,771
* Ay
* Ay *

300
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:12,439
* Ay
* Hey *

301
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:14,174
* Chocolate

302
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:15,442
* Chocolate

303
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:17,210
* Ay, just cashed the check

304
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:19,279
* And I'm 'bout
to blow it all on chocolate *

305
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:21,314
* Yeah, I'm 'bout
to blow it all on chocolate *

306
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:23,784
* Sweet tooth, baby,
make that dollar stretch *

307
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:26,153
* Chocolate

308
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,789
* Chocolate

309
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:29,990
* Chocolate

310
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,491
* Uh, I feel my sweet tooth
acting up *

311
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,193
* All I need is you
to go on 'head *

312
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:34,862
* Back it up,
honey, paper sack brown... *

313
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:39,032
Tell me, what is
it you desire?

314
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:40,333
(laughs)

315
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:43,470
For you to move
so I can talk to my boyfriend.

316
00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:45,973
Oh. S-S...

317
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:47,741
(clears throat)
Sorry about that.

318
00:11:47,775 --> 00:11:50,878
* Yum, yum, yum, yum *
* All I need is you
to go on 'head, back it up *

319
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,946
* Yum, yum, yum, chocolate *
* All I need is you to go on
'head, back it up *

320
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,816
* All I need is you to go
on 'head, back it up *
* Chocolate *

321
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:58,819
* Back it up, back it up,
back it up, back it up *
* Chocolate *

322
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:00,921
Hello, there.

323
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:02,455
* Back it up

324
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:04,992
Guess what?
What?

325
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:06,927
You get to have sex with me.

326
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,229
* Blow it all on chocolate

327
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:12,165
* Sweet tooth, baby,
make that dollar stretch *

328
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:14,467
* Chocolate
Didn't go as planned.

329
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:16,369
* Chocolate

330
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:17,871
* Chocolate
(sighs)

331
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:19,039
* Chocolate

332
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,241
* You ever find yourself stuck
in between *
Hi.

333
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:23,143
* A rock and a hard place,
sleep for a dream *

334
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:25,012
* I'm hard and a heartless
king without a queen *

335
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:27,014
You want to
buy me a drink?

336
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:28,581
* We ain't throwing racks,
I'm just throwing D *

337
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:31,418
* And makin' music for
the people that be... *
* Chocolate. *

338
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:33,153
CHLOE:
Tyson's father

339
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:36,123
in jail, mother's dead.
Foster care.

340
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:37,958
In and out of juvie
since he was seven.

341
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:39,426
Record is sealed.

342
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:41,361
Judging by the size
of his file,

343
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:44,097
Firehawk Ranch was probably
Tyson Chase's last stop

344
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:46,934
before a long stay
at Chino or San Quentin.

345
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:48,435
Hmm.
You get something from MTA?

346
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:50,938
Yup. Camera caught him exiting
a station in Hollywood.

347
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:52,472
No sign of him after that.

348
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:53,573
(footsteps approaching)

349
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:57,544
Hey, Decker, how's it going
with the Firehawk case?

350
00:12:57,577 --> 00:12:58,979
Very well, sir.

351
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:00,981
Uh, murder weapon
still missing.

352
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:02,883
Although, we've
identified the suspect.

353
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,052
Tyson Chase.
He's a resident.

354
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:07,087
There's a BOLO out.

355
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,288
So no one's in custody yet?

356
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:09,256
Not yet.

357
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,859
Thought you'd be further along.

358
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:20,033
Wow.

359
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:22,369
Why is Pierce
such a dick to me?

360
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:24,271
Who cares?
He's a dick to everybody.

361
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:25,939
No, but I seem
to be getting

362
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:27,841
extra helpings of
his dickishness.

363
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,076
I know he's
considered a rock star

364
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:31,879
downtown with the suits, but
if he's got a problem with me,

365
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:34,081
I want to find out,
I want to fix it,

366
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:36,449
and I don't want it
messing with my career.

367
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:39,386
Maybe you're not
the problem.

368
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:41,454
Lucifer!

369
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:42,589
Mm.

370
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:44,491
(sighs)

371
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:48,428
Well, looks like someone could
use a single malt cappuccino.

372
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:50,597
Single malt latte?

373
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,999
CHLOE:
I'd prefer

374
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:53,100
if you helped us find
Tyson Chase.

375
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:55,468
Your focus has been
all over the map on this case.

376
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:58,605
Well, I forget how much you've
come to rely on me these days.

377
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:01,474
Allow me to consult.
Catching this little

378
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:02,709
degenerate is quite simple.

379
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:05,445
Whatever Tyson's sin was
in the past, he's back at it.

380
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:06,579
And you know why?

381
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:08,415
People don't change.

382
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:10,617
We don't know his crimes.
His record is sealed.

383
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:11,985
Tyson's a minor.

384
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:13,921
Well, I'll call a judge,
get it unsealed.

385
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:15,155
It may take a few days.

386
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:18,158
Or not. I may have a way
to cut a few corners.

387
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,060
Getting caught cutting corners
is the last thing

388
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:21,494
I need right now, Lucifer.

389
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:24,631
It'll be better
if I handle it alone.

390
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:27,434
(sighs)
Go fish.

391
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,536
(footsteps approaching)

392
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:32,039
Ah. Hello, Judgey.

393
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:33,373
And this must be Marsha.

394
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:34,942
Uh, Lucifer.

395
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:37,010
What do you want?
That favor returned.

396
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:38,111
I need your help proving

397
00:14:38,145 --> 00:14:40,513
a young deplorable
hasn't reformed and never will.

398
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:43,083
So... your turn to pick

399
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:45,352
from the pile,
I think.

400
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,420
*

401
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:53,426
(car engine starts)

402
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,195
Bravo.

403
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,297
Quick. I mean, not
Vin Diesel quick,

404
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,132
but impressive nonetheless.
Scoot over.

405
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:05,272
Well. Tyson Chase.

406
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:07,440
Your record said you
liked to steal cars

407
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:08,675
to pay for your drugs.

408
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,177
Vintage muscle cars,
to be precise.

409
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,344
And you've been
arrested here twice.

410
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:14,514
I guess third time's a charm,
and by charm, I mean me.

411
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:17,117
Yeah, but my record's sealed.
How'd you know?

412
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,418
I called in a favor.

413
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:21,321
'Cause I need to prove to that
charlatan at Firehawk Ranch

414
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:24,024
that you are and always
will be a criminal.

415
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:25,525
Whatever, man.

416
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:28,295
Look, if you a cop,
I got nothing to say.

417
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:30,297
Nothing matters
anymore anyway.

418
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,265
I'd rather die than go back.

419
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:34,234
Well, that can
be arranged.

420
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,403
(tires squeal)
Oh!

421
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:37,737
Whoa! Oh, oh, oh.
* I'm gonna take my baby *

422
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,307
Whoa, whoa, whoa, man!
Okay, okay.
* On a little joy ride...

423
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,741
Chill out. Chill out.
Chill out! Slow down.

424
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,743
Slow down.
I'm not gonna
slow down, Tyson.

425
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,246
You said you wanted to die.
Do you want a quick death,

426
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,349
or a slow death?
No! I take it back. Stop. Stop.

427
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:53,220
(tires squealing)
Hey, man, what...
what you doing? (screams)

428
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:55,388
* Crash like lightning,
crash like thunder... *

429
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:58,458
Okay, look, I take it back,
all right? I take it back.

430
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:01,261
I don't want to die. I'll come
with you, tell you anything.

431
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,030
Smells like you
might need a change

432
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:04,364
of underpants
first, Tyson.

433
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:12,239
I present to you
one unreformable gnat

434
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:14,541
to answer for
his crimes.
Where did you find him?

435
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:17,077
I witnessed the little reprobate
stealing a getaway car,

436
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,745
so I carried out
a citizen's arrest.

437
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:22,082
Like I said,
once bad, always bad.

438
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:24,084
Look, get this psycho dude
away from me!

439
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:25,218
He almost killed me!

440
00:16:25,252 --> 00:16:26,419
(laughs)
Hello, kettle.

441
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:28,188
Pot calling.

442
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:32,759
However, I must commend you on
your choice of murder weapon.

443
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:35,328
Murder weapon?
CHLOE:
We found your tool belt

444
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:36,396
in Emily Goddard's office,

445
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,465
minus the pruning saw
that you used to kill her.

446
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,467
Wait. Emily's dead?

447
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,303
Oh, my God.

448
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:44,637
(exhales)

449
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,473
You think I killed her?
Yes.

450
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:49,576
No. Look, I loved Emily.

451
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:51,411
I'd never hurt her.

452
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:52,579
People heard you fighting,
Tyson.

453
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:54,381
Because she wouldn't talk to me.

454
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:56,116
I just wanted to talk.

455
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:57,750
About what?

456
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:01,088
(sighs)

457
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:02,122
Look, I turned 18,

458
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:04,457
and didn't have to stay
at the ranch anymore.

459
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:06,459
I wanted her to come with me.

460
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:10,330
Look, we kissed one time...

461
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,765
but she said it was... she...

462
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,102
she said it a mistake.

463
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:18,771
She wouldn't leave.

464
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:20,407
Oh, no.

465
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,674
She rejected you?

466
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,243
So you killed her!

467
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:25,078
This is all my fault.

468
00:17:25,112 --> 00:17:26,813
Oh, finally, we're
getting somewhere.

469
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:32,152
No. Look, if-if I hadn't left,
Emily would still be alive.

470
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,622
I could've protected her.
From who?

471
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:37,690
Uh, she was worried about

472
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,292
expelling a resident.

473
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:40,227
Said everything had gone
to hell.

474
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,595
That's why
she wouldn't talk with me.

475
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:45,732
That's why we fought.

476
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:49,536
Look, please,
you have to believe me.

477
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,171
Filthy liar.
I believe him.

478
00:17:51,204 --> 00:17:52,739
My gut tells me
it's not him.

479
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:54,474
And I want to
explore this mystery

480
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:56,109
resident that Emily
wanted to expel.

481
00:17:56,143 --> 00:17:57,677
How much walking
and talking

482
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,746
like a murderous,
sociopathic duck is necessary

483
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:03,116
for us to realize the killer
is sitting in our laps?
(phone beeps)

484
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,751
(chuckling)

485
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:07,454
Something you'd like
to add here, Espinoza?

486
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,323
Uh, no. Sorry.
I just...

487
00:18:10,357 --> 00:18:12,359
I need to go help a
friend who's in trouble.

488
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:14,461
Well, don't let your day job
keep you.

489
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:17,164
(exhales) I'll have
the victim's files sent over.

490
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:20,333
Maybe we can get a lead
on whoever she wanted to expel.

491
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,537
I doubt I could
be less impressed

492
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:26,206
by the lack of
consensus here.

493
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:29,842
All we have now is no murder
weapon and a possible motive?

494
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:31,778
We got to cut
him loose.
(scoffs)

495
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:33,146
Without a murder weapon,

496
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,781
we don't have enough evidence
to keep him.

497
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:38,251
Hello, Tyson.
Just me again.

498
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:41,854
Now, why can't you
embrace your true self, hmm?

499
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:43,490
You're a bad seed.

500
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:44,924
Just celebrate the
darkness inside.

501
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,626
No, please!
Just leave me alone!

502
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:49,262
I won't leave you alone until
you tell me the truth.
Look, please don't hurt me.

503
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:51,264
I promise I've changed.

504
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:53,266
Lucifer, let him go!

505
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,903
I take full responsibility
for his actions.

506
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:59,706
This won't happen again.
Why not?

507
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:01,608
Kid turns out not
to be the murderer,

508
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,142
your friend just
scared him straight.

509
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:05,578
Well done, Lucifer.

510
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:07,647
Way to be a good influence.

511
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,549
How dare you say that?

512
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:12,352
Do you see what
you've done now?

513
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:14,387
(scoffs)

514
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:16,289
(sighs)

515
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:20,360
I'll show them
a good influence.

516
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:24,464
* The one in the back room
rarely sees the light of day *

517
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,199
* The one on the low, low road

518
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:28,401
* He went the bad,
the b-bad way *

519
00:19:28,435 --> 00:19:29,636
* He went the bad way...

520
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,438
Good morning.
Good morning.

521
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:33,940
Right, gather 'round, children.
Gather 'round.

522
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:35,475
Come on.

523
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,609
Don't be shy.

524
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:38,211
Don't be shy.
I don't bite.

525
00:19:38,245 --> 00:19:39,412
(laughs)

526
00:19:39,446 --> 00:19:40,680
Ah.

527
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:42,582
Who's the suit?
Lucifer Morningstar,

528
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:46,686
your substitute counselor
and resident bad influence.

529
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,421
Is this some kind
of reverse psychology?

530
00:19:48,455 --> 00:19:50,290
(laughs)
I assure you,

531
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:52,392
my budding miscreant,
nothing of the sort.

532
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:54,761
No, the lesson
I'm about to teach you

533
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:57,397
is pure deviance.
Yes, come on.

534
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:01,401
Room for everyone. Come on,
you at the back. Right.

535
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:05,972
Okay, before I start,
I'd humbly like to ask you guys

536
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:09,409
a little about
yourselves, so, tell me,

537
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:11,411
what is it you all desire?

538
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:12,879
Get rich.
Instagram model.

539
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:14,046
MAN: Make people feel good.
Oh.

540
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,615
WOMAN: I just want
to be alone, man.
Be my own boss.

541
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:16,683
MAN 2:
Play video games!

542
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:17,850
My father's love.

543
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:18,985
Oh.
WOMAN 2:
Easy money!

544
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:20,453
I just want to get high, man.

545
00:20:20,487 --> 00:20:22,889
I hear you. I hear you. Right.

546
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:24,457
So what I'm getting

547
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:27,327
is that you all want to get back
to your true selves.

548
00:20:28,495 --> 00:20:29,696
(laughs)

549
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,698
I mean, yes, micro-nutrients

550
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,866
in the soil are important,

551
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,034
but the key here, people,

552
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,904
the key here is
vertical integration.

553
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:41,374
And it all starts
with solid distribution.

554
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:43,910
Right. Now, I'm partial
to the Paraguay corridor,

555
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:45,978
mainly because...

556
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:46,746
Oh, oh, uh?

557
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:48,815
Pl... Yes. Hair boy.

558
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:51,351
Uh, but what about
hands-on experience?

559
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:52,919
(laughs)
Oh, right.

560
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:55,555
Well, I do happen
to know some wonderful CEOs

561
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,324
down in Sinaloa, Mexico.

562
00:20:57,357 --> 00:20:59,626
Perhaps I could arrange
some internships.

563
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:01,394
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, well.

564
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:04,664
The way to hell really is paved
with bad acne-prone intentions.

565
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:06,733
So much potential here! But...

566
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,035
Sorry. Am I boring you, darling?

567
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:12,038
Yeah. Screw Paraguay
and micro-nutrients.

568
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:15,007
The only things you need
to be your own CEO

569
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,677
is irrigation and
a south-facing slope.

570
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,547
Ah.

571
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:25,418
Here's your drug empire, Teach.

572
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:33,393
Well, then.

573
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:38,030
It appears someone's gunning
for extra credit.

574
00:21:38,064 --> 00:21:41,501
(inhales and exhales deeply)
* Low, low, ends in a bad,
b-bad way. *

575
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:46,839
*

576
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,816
* I'm high,
staring at the ceiling *

577
00:21:56,849 --> 00:22:01,421
* Sending my love,
what a wonderful feeling *

578
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:05,024
* It feels good
to be running from the devil *

579
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:09,796
* Another breath
and I'm up another level *

580
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,898
LUCIFER:
Don't get high
on your own supply.

581
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:14,834
ALL:
Don't get high
on your own supply.

582
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:16,836
Snitches end up in ditches.

583
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:19,572
ALL:
Snitches end up in ditches.

584
00:22:19,606 --> 00:22:21,140
Hugs, not drugs.

585
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,010
(laughing): No... Sorry,
sorry. Reverse that one.

586
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:25,912
Drugs, not hugs.

587
00:22:25,945 --> 00:22:27,614
ALL:
Drugs, not hugs.

588
00:22:27,647 --> 00:22:28,915
Lucifer?

589
00:22:28,948 --> 00:22:30,383
Detective.

590
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:32,952
What is going on here?

591
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:34,854
And how did you
get that horse?

592
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:36,656
What horse?

593
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:37,924
Ugh.

594
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:40,026
Bye!

595
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:42,495
Ah, they should award him
his wings.

596
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:44,397
Then he'd look like
Pegasus. (laughs)

597
00:22:44,431 --> 00:22:46,766
What are you
so upset about?

598
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,768
I mean, it was
a valuable teaching moment

599
00:22:48,801 --> 00:22:49,869
for the children.

600
00:22:49,902 --> 00:22:52,405
They are our future, after all.

601
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:54,173
You're teaching them
to grow drugs.

602
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,743
No, no, no, I'm teaching them
to sel drugs.

603
00:22:56,776 --> 00:22:58,645
Regardless,
what brings you here?

604
00:22:58,678 --> 00:23:00,580
Our job.

605
00:23:00,613 --> 00:23:04,417
Which is to find the kid
that Emily was about to expel.

606
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:05,852
In her files, it said

607
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,620
that she had recently busted
one of the residents

608
00:23:07,654 --> 00:23:10,156
for apparently running
a drug operation.

609
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:11,891
No.

610
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:13,125
Oh.

611
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:14,627
Right. (laughs)
So... Well, it appears

612
00:23:14,661 --> 00:23:16,095
I've been doing our job, too.

613
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:18,598
Carly, front and center.

614
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:20,166
My prized pupil.

615
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:22,168
She had her own weed operation
already up and running.

616
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:25,204
Oh. So, this is all yours?

617
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,974
Not saying a word
without my lawyer.

618
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:30,142
(laughs)
Sorry, I taught her that.

619
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:31,644
But I have to say, Detective,

620
00:23:31,678 --> 00:23:34,146
this young lady
really is going places.

621
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:37,149
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
All the way to jail.

622
00:23:40,553 --> 00:23:42,855
Yo, buddy.

623
00:23:42,889 --> 00:23:44,156
What the hell happened, man?

624
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,158
Detective Espinoza.

625
00:23:46,192 --> 00:23:47,894
It's good to see you.

626
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,729
(laughs)
When I heard the charges,
I mean...

627
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:52,499
Listen, we had just performed
the act of love,

628
00:23:52,532 --> 00:23:54,667
and then she demanded money.

629
00:23:54,701 --> 00:23:57,637
(chuckles)
At first, I assumed
it was for bus fare,

630
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,572
but then she wanted
quite a large amount.

631
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:01,641
And then her cousin showed up,

632
00:24:01,674 --> 00:24:04,076
who shared very little familial
resemblance, by the way,

633
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,745
and then he also
demanded money.

634
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:07,547
Right, right.
So when he wouldn't take no

635
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,550
for an answer, you got into
a fight, and you beat him up.

636
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:12,118
Uh-huh.

637
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:13,820
You do realize
she's a call girl, right?

638
00:24:13,853 --> 00:24:16,756
I know what a prostitute is!

639
00:24:18,525 --> 00:24:20,827
I just didn't know she was one.

640
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:24,096
And then, her cousin-- well,
he wouldn't listen to reason.

641
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:27,667
You mean... her pimp?

642
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,969
Yes, of course.

643
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:32,572
Look, I don't need any of
the details, all right?

644
00:24:32,605 --> 00:24:34,240
The important thing is,
the watch commander's

645
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:36,843
my old training officer,
so I pulled some strings.

646
00:24:36,876 --> 00:24:39,879
You're cut loose.
Don't worry.

647
00:24:39,912 --> 00:24:42,815
(laughing): Don't worry.
I didn't say a word to Lucifer.

648
00:24:44,283 --> 00:24:46,018
PIERCE: How we doing
on the investigation?

649
00:24:46,052 --> 00:24:47,920
CHLOE:
Well, this investigation has...

650
00:24:47,954 --> 00:24:49,722
(clears throat)
...smoked out

651
00:24:49,756 --> 00:24:51,924
Carly Glantz.
Rap sheet a mile long.

652
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:54,060
Made no progress at reform.

653
00:24:54,093 --> 00:24:56,262
Working theory is
that she found out

654
00:24:56,295 --> 00:24:57,496
Emily was about
to expel her.

655
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:00,066
So she killed her to protect
herself and her drug operation.

656
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:02,268
And then, Carly lawyered up
before we could get to her.

657
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:05,137
Still no murder weapon?
And no evidence
tying her to the scene.

658
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:06,238
Lucifer, any thoughts?

659
00:25:06,272 --> 00:25:08,207
CHLOE:
Lucifer is not

660
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,576
in the state of mind

661
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:11,277
to offer any constructive advice
right now.

662
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,745
Reach for the unexpected

663
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:15,181
and allow yourself
to be surprised.

664
00:25:15,214 --> 00:25:16,883
Like crisps
and chocolate.

665
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:20,987
The results
can be quite pleasing. Mm.

666
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,823
That's good advice.
Decker, throw out the manual.

667
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:24,523
Think outside the box.

668
00:25:24,557 --> 00:25:25,424
Yes, Lieutenant.
CHLOE:
What?

669
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:27,627
I'm sorry. What are you
asking me to do?

670
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,228
Because Carly isn't gonna talk.

671
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:31,230
I want to talk.

672
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:38,905
Ah. Allow yourself to
be surprised indeed.

673
00:25:38,938 --> 00:25:41,273
CHLOE:
So, you want
to make a statement?

674
00:25:41,307 --> 00:25:44,577
Yeah. So...

675
00:25:44,611 --> 00:25:47,647
I guess I've been enlightened
by the Firehawk Path.

676
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,682
And I know
I can't find my happiness

677
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:51,283
if I don't
present my truth.

678
00:25:51,317 --> 00:25:52,919
The night of the murder,
I saw Tyson Chase

679
00:25:52,952 --> 00:25:56,055
digging by the sundial,
burying something.

680
00:25:56,088 --> 00:25:57,857
Burying what?
Don't know.

681
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,593
It was dark, and I was
looking through a window.

682
00:26:00,627 --> 00:26:03,195
Geez, do I have
to do all your work for you?

683
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:05,197
Carly, tone.

684
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:07,299
Should I roll over
and fetch, too, Dad?

685
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:09,602
Parents. Am I right?

686
00:26:09,636 --> 00:26:12,071
CHLOE: So, how do I know
you didn't kill Emily?

687
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:13,272
CARLY'S DAD:
Because Carly has

688
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:15,341
an iron-clad alibi.

689
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:17,844
During the murder,
she was in the shared room...

690
00:26:17,877 --> 00:26:20,246
on the computer,

691
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,348
video chatting
with her boyfriend.

692
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:28,688
Now, instead of harassing
my daughter any further,

693
00:26:28,721 --> 00:26:31,658
I suggest you go see
what's under that sundial.

694
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:37,063
LUCIFER:
I don't mean to backseat

695
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,231
dig, but aren't you
a bit far from the sundial?

696
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:42,301
I've got it. Thanks.

697
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:44,170
At least, I hope I do.

698
00:26:44,203 --> 00:26:49,375
Hey, Ella, you're kind of, sort
of friendly with the lieutenant.

699
00:26:49,408 --> 00:26:51,010
What's his deal?

700
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:52,712
Regarding what?

701
00:26:52,745 --> 00:26:56,248
Well, no matter what I do,
it seems Pierce wants

702
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:57,950
to be a complete jerk to me.

703
00:26:57,984 --> 00:27:02,121
Oh, this isn't about
that crazy vibe between you two?

704
00:27:02,154 --> 00:27:04,857
No, this is about professional
respect, which I've earned.

705
00:27:04,891 --> 00:27:07,359
I have the best close
rate in the department,

706
00:27:07,393 --> 00:27:09,696
and it seems like,
no matter where I turn,

707
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:11,798
Pierce is there,
questioning my judgment.

708
00:27:11,831 --> 00:27:13,432
Are you talking
about the new lieutenant?

709
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,267
I like him.
Very good judgment.

710
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:17,036
Totally agree. Spot on.

711
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:20,306
What? It's true.

712
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:21,941
Okay, you got it all wrong.

713
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:23,209
Look,

714
00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:26,278
at first, I didn't think Pierce
liked me, either, but then,

715
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:28,247
a couple of days ago
in the kitchen,

716
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,918
he hands me the creamer

717
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:33,285
and the sugar.

718
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:36,055
And I didn't even ask for it.

719
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:37,289
I know, right?

720
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:38,891
Right.

721
00:27:38,925 --> 00:27:42,394
See, Pierce had noticed
how I liked my coffee.

722
00:27:42,428 --> 00:27:46,899
Just pay attention
to his actions, not his words.

723
00:27:46,933 --> 00:27:52,338
And regardless, Decker,
you are a total badass.

724
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:53,873
Thank you, Ella.

725
00:27:53,906 --> 00:27:55,441
(sighs)

726
00:27:57,343 --> 00:27:59,178
(shovel clinking)

727
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:00,913
You got something?

728
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:10,923
"Nine five four four."

729
00:28:10,957 --> 00:28:13,159
It's Tyson Chase's number.

730
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:14,894
I guess he is our killer.

731
00:28:14,927 --> 00:28:18,197
See? What did I tell you?
Once a bad guy,

732
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,332
always a bad guy.

733
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:30,209
The blood on Tyson Chase's
pruning saw matches the victim.

734
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:32,879
Carly Glantz puts
the bloody saw

735
00:28:32,912 --> 00:28:35,314
in his hands
after the murder.

736
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:38,217
So Tyson Chase equals
homicidal maniac.

737
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,452
What am I missing?
Nothing.

738
00:28:40,486 --> 00:28:41,653
(chuckles, yawns)

739
00:28:41,687 --> 00:28:44,190
Oh, sorry. It's just exhausting
being right all the time,

740
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,892
isn't it?
(laughs) I'm kidding.

741
00:28:45,925 --> 00:28:46,893
It's amazing.

742
00:28:46,926 --> 00:28:48,995
Wait a minute.
What if Lucifer really is right?

743
00:28:49,028 --> 00:28:50,129
Oh, go on.

744
00:28:50,162 --> 00:28:52,832
Then if, per Lucifer,
people really don't reform,

745
00:28:52,865 --> 00:28:54,333
that would also apply
to Carly Glantz.

746
00:28:54,366 --> 00:28:56,202
Once bad, always bad, right?

747
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:57,904
Right. Finally you get it.

748
00:28:57,937 --> 00:29:00,339
So, then, how the hell did
the worst kid in the program,

749
00:29:00,372 --> 00:29:01,808
on the verge
of expulsion,

750
00:29:01,841 --> 00:29:03,776
earn highly-coveted
computer privileges

751
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,978
to video chat
with her boyfriend?

752
00:29:06,012 --> 00:29:08,247
I don't know.
Sexual favors?

753
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,516
Well, I want to go back
and talk to Jerry Blackcrow,

754
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:12,518
ask him some more questions.
Something doesn't add up.

755
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:13,853
You think Blackcrow's involved?

756
00:29:13,886 --> 00:29:15,221
(sighs) I don't know.
Maybe.

757
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:17,924
(phone rings)
I want to know why Carly
is getting these privileges.

758
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:19,125
Lucifer, you coming?

759
00:29:19,158 --> 00:29:21,427
Oh, I can't. Sorry.
Duty calls.

760
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,561
Oh. What's duty's name?

761
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:26,132
Lexy, if you must know,
a judge's soon to be ex-wife.

762
00:29:26,165 --> 00:29:27,333
It's a long story.

763
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:29,101
Great. Are you really
not coming?

764
00:29:29,135 --> 00:29:30,569
I made a promise, Detective.

765
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,339
And who am I if I'm not
a devil of my word? Besides,

766
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:35,274
we both know
this case is already solved.

767
00:29:35,307 --> 00:29:36,442
Lucifer, go.

768
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:38,477
You've earned
some private time.

769
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:41,480
Ah, well, thank you,
Lieutenant. See?

770
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:42,748
Great judgment.

771
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,317
I don't care what you say.
I'm gonna keep digging on this.

772
00:29:45,351 --> 00:29:47,086
I think it's time
I ride along with you.

773
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:50,456
Frankly, Lieutenant, just
because you and I disagree

774
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:52,391
does not mean
I need a baby-sitter.

775
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:54,226
You coming, Decker?

776
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:56,295
* Rock star

777
00:29:56,328 --> 00:29:57,897
* We'll have a good time *

778
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,132
* Tonight

779
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:02,034
* Livin' large *

780
00:30:02,068 --> 00:30:05,171
* There's nothing
that you can't do *

781
00:30:05,204 --> 00:30:07,073
* Do it all

782
00:30:07,106 --> 00:30:10,042
* Yeah, we'll have a good time
tonight... *

783
00:30:10,076 --> 00:30:13,579
My father is trying to teach me
a lesson about Lucifer.

784
00:30:13,612 --> 00:30:16,916
Problem is, I don't know
what it is.

785
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:17,950
And he didn't tell you?

786
00:30:17,984 --> 00:30:20,086
He's a bit, uh...

787
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:22,388
enigmatic, my dad.
Ah.

788
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:24,356
Sounds complicated.

789
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:26,558
You have no idea.

790
00:30:26,592 --> 00:30:30,963
So I've been, um, walking
a mile in Lucifer's shoes

791
00:30:30,997 --> 00:30:34,533
to learn more about him,
to try and understand him.

792
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:36,903
Bro, what's there to understand?
The guy does what he wants,

793
00:30:36,936 --> 00:30:38,938
he says what he wants,
he gets away with it.

794
00:30:38,971 --> 00:30:41,073
He parties constantly,
he apparently

795
00:30:41,107 --> 00:30:45,211
has an endless supply of cash,
drives a sick-ass ride. Thanks.

796
00:30:45,244 --> 00:30:49,882
And he gets to have sex with a
different hot girl every night.

797
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:54,120
What a terrible,
lonely existence.

798
00:30:54,153 --> 00:30:56,989
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sounds awful.

799
00:30:58,257 --> 00:31:00,226
Anyway, Dan,
thanks for bailing me out.

800
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:01,460
No problem, man.

801
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:04,396
We all need someone to have
our backs every now and then.

802
00:31:06,265 --> 00:31:09,035
You're right. We do.

803
00:31:09,068 --> 00:31:10,636
* Party like a rock star...

804
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:13,339
(crowd chatter)

805
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:14,640
(crickets chirping)

806
00:31:14,673 --> 00:31:16,675
You sure this is
the right way?

807
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,545
Positive.

808
00:31:22,414 --> 00:31:24,383
I'm a badass, you know.

809
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,118
Excuse me?

810
00:31:26,152 --> 00:31:27,386
Even though
you don't trust me.

811
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,188
What makes you think
I don't trust you?

812
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:30,389
Oh, let's see.

813
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:33,192
You've only been breathing down
my neck this entire case.

814
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:36,428
Any time Lucifer sneezes,
you praise him, you berate me.

815
00:31:36,462 --> 00:31:38,664
You chose to ride along just
so you could check up on me.

816
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:41,267
Oh, and you shot down
my request to be union rep

817
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,601
without even considering it.

818
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:44,503
(laughs)
What? You think
this is all a joke?

819
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:46,672
I'm laughing because you
think me turning you down

820
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:48,407
for that union rep
job was a bad thing.

821
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,076
How is it a good thing?

822
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:51,610
That job is for has-beens.

823
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:54,213
I'm not gonna waste one
of my best detectives

824
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,015
while you attend
useless meetings.

825
00:31:56,048 --> 00:31:58,017
And the only reason I came here
was so I could finally

826
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,418
see you in action firsthand.
(door creaks open)

827
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:02,188
You think that I'm one
of your best detectives?

828
00:32:02,221 --> 00:32:04,056
Decker, gun!

829
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,592
(gunshot, Pierce groans)

830
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:10,062
(gunshots)

831
00:32:16,202 --> 00:32:17,936
(gunshots)

832
00:32:24,743 --> 00:32:26,678
(panting)

833
00:32:29,048 --> 00:32:31,183
(truck door closes)

834
00:32:31,217 --> 00:32:33,652
(engine revving)

835
00:32:38,357 --> 00:32:40,459
(gasps)

836
00:32:42,094 --> 00:32:44,130
Lieutenant, come on.

837
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:46,098
Stay with me.

838
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:48,734
Unit 831. Officer down!

839
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:50,036
Officer down!

840
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:57,276
(siren whoops)

841
00:32:59,545 --> 00:33:01,213
Get their statement and
get back to me, please.

842
00:33:01,247 --> 00:33:02,681
Detective?
Thank you.

843
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:04,516
Are you okay?

844
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,252
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

845
00:33:06,285 --> 00:33:08,154
I mean, thanks to
Lieutenant Pierce.

846
00:33:08,187 --> 00:33:09,255
He saved my life.

847
00:33:09,288 --> 00:33:10,756
Jerry Blackcrow tried
to kill you.

848
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:12,058
I don't believe it.

849
00:33:12,091 --> 00:33:14,426
Wait. What am I saying?

850
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,195
Didn't he say
he was an ex-con himself?

851
00:33:16,228 --> 00:33:18,230
More proof there's no such thing
as transformation.

852
00:33:18,264 --> 00:33:19,598
Hey, can we talk
about this later?

853
00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:21,167
I got to get to the hospital.

854
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,502
I...

855
00:33:23,535 --> 00:33:27,773
DAN: Have 'em notify
Union Station, too.

856
00:33:27,806 --> 00:33:29,775
Daniel?

857
00:33:29,808 --> 00:33:30,509
Yeah.

858
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:31,743
Have you located
the reform guru?

859
00:33:31,777 --> 00:33:34,580
I'd like to have a word.
Yeah? Well, get
in line, pal.

860
00:33:34,613 --> 00:33:36,048
We put out a statewide APB,

861
00:33:36,082 --> 00:33:37,716
we're checking bus stations,
airports.

862
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:39,485
So far, nothing.

863
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:42,621
Look, man, Chloe's fine.

864
00:33:42,654 --> 00:33:44,223
Luckily, Pierce
was with her.

865
00:33:44,256 --> 00:33:46,358
(scoffs)

866
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:50,129
But I wasn't.

867
00:33:50,162 --> 00:33:53,165
Hey, guys, I want you to
check all local ATM cameras.

868
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:55,567
If Blackcrow is fleeing,
he's gonna need cash.

869
00:33:55,601 --> 00:33:58,270
That's the only way to
get any at this hour.

870
00:33:58,304 --> 00:34:01,440
Unless he's got a stash
somewhere.

871
00:34:04,443 --> 00:34:06,578
(birds squawking)

872
00:34:13,252 --> 00:34:16,088
(sighs)

873
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:29,268
So, this is where the
Firehawk Path leads.

874
00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:31,337
A soggy stash of
coke-dusted twenties

875
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:33,139
and a boat
ride to Mexico.

876
00:34:33,172 --> 00:34:34,673
How did you find me?

877
00:34:34,706 --> 00:34:37,843
My prized pupil mentioned
using her dad's beach condo

878
00:34:37,876 --> 00:34:38,710
as a stash house.

879
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:41,580
Of course her partner
would know that.

880
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:45,551
What do you want,
Mr. Morningstar?

881
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:48,854
To see the look on your face
when you finally admit

882
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:50,556
it was all a scam,

883
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:54,526
a ploy to bilk desperate
parents into falsely believing

884
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,628
that you could fix their
malevolent offspring.

885
00:34:56,662 --> 00:34:58,864
I did a lot of good
for those kids.

886
00:34:58,897 --> 00:35:01,400
So I was right
about people not changing,

887
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:03,235
just wrong about who.

888
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:05,637
I warned Emily,

889
00:35:05,671 --> 00:35:08,274
but she wouldn't
listen to reason.

890
00:35:08,307 --> 00:35:10,176
It was her own fault.

891
00:35:10,209 --> 00:35:11,477
What about
the detective?

892
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,345
She was just in my way, man.

893
00:35:13,379 --> 00:35:15,681
I'm not going back to jail!

894
00:35:18,917 --> 00:35:21,187
(groans)

895
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,354
(grunts)

896
00:35:22,388 --> 00:35:24,490
(choking)

897
00:35:24,523 --> 00:35:26,558
Your punishment will be
far worse than jail.

898
00:35:43,275 --> 00:35:45,577
(groaning)

899
00:35:45,611 --> 00:35:47,246
Lucifer, stop!
(groans)

900
00:35:47,279 --> 00:35:48,247
You're gonna kill him.

901
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,449
(guttural gasping)
So what?

902
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:52,751
Once evil,
always evil, right?!

903
00:35:52,784 --> 00:35:54,920
No, Luci. You're not evil.

904
00:35:54,953 --> 00:35:56,955
You're the Devil.

905
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,490
You puni evil.

906
00:36:00,426 --> 00:36:02,561
Your words.

907
00:36:04,463 --> 00:36:07,666
(groans, pants)

908
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:16,208
(indistinct female voice
over P.A.)

909
00:36:22,481 --> 00:36:24,450
(sighs)

910
00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:26,652
You gonna say hello, Decker,

911
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:29,788
or just creep
around the room?

912
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:31,790
Sorry, Lieutenant.
I didn't know

913
00:36:31,823 --> 00:36:33,692
if you were sleeping or not.
I wanted to say

914
00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:35,361
thank you for what you did.

915
00:36:35,394 --> 00:36:37,996
It's just part of the job.
It's no big deal.

916
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:41,433
No, it's a huge deal.
You saved my life.

917
00:36:41,467 --> 00:36:43,302
I'm so grateful.

918
00:36:43,335 --> 00:36:44,570
And you saved mine.

919
00:36:44,603 --> 00:36:46,272
We're even.

920
00:36:47,806 --> 00:36:50,709
So have you ever been injured
on the job before?

921
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:54,480
I've had a few scrapes.

922
00:36:56,615 --> 00:37:00,252
The possibility of death
has never felt...

923
00:37:00,286 --> 00:37:02,254
so real before.

924
00:37:02,288 --> 00:37:03,755
Yeah.

925
00:37:03,789 --> 00:37:07,793
You know, when I was shot,
I was completely freaked out.

926
00:37:07,826 --> 00:37:12,331
I kept thinking, like, how
could it all end so suddenly?

927
00:37:12,364 --> 00:37:17,269
But the best thing I did was,
I went back to work, and

928
00:37:17,303 --> 00:37:19,338
I just kept at it, you know?

929
00:37:19,371 --> 00:37:22,574
'Cause you really do realize
life is so short.

930
00:37:22,608 --> 00:37:25,844
And you have to just live it
while you can.

931
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:31,983
Speaking of work,
I-I should get back

932
00:37:32,017 --> 00:37:34,853
and, uh, finish up
Blackcrow's arrest sheet.

933
00:37:34,886 --> 00:37:38,490
Um, I-I don't know
if you heard, but he turned up

934
00:37:38,524 --> 00:37:40,492
half-beaten, hogtied in Malibu.

935
00:37:40,526 --> 00:37:41,993
Karma, I guess.

936
00:37:42,027 --> 00:37:44,630
Anyhow,

937
00:37:44,663 --> 00:37:46,965
thanks again for the...

938
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:50,502
whole lifesaving thing.

939
00:37:50,536 --> 00:37:53,772
Couldn't let anything happen
to my best detective.

940
00:37:56,074 --> 00:37:58,844
So now
I'm your best detective?

941
00:38:00,812 --> 00:38:03,048
I didn't want you
to get all full of yourself.

942
00:38:04,816 --> 00:38:08,286
I can see why
Lucifer's so affected by you.

943
00:38:09,688 --> 00:38:11,623
It's because
you're special, Decker.

944
00:38:19,465 --> 00:38:21,400
Hey, Chloe.
Hi.

945
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:23,469
Uh, Lieutenant,
I just wanted to say

946
00:38:23,502 --> 00:38:26,572
that, um, I hope
you feel better soon.

947
00:38:26,605 --> 00:38:28,073
Thanks, Espinoza.

948
00:38:28,106 --> 00:38:30,576
I also wanted to thank you
for putting me up

949
00:38:30,609 --> 00:38:32,344
for the union rep
position. Sorry, Chloe.

950
00:38:32,378 --> 00:38:33,979
I know you wanted that one, too.

951
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,448
And I...

952
00:38:36,482 --> 00:38:37,649
I won't let you down, sir.

953
00:38:37,683 --> 00:38:38,817
I know you won't.

954
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,452
You earned it, buddy.

955
00:38:40,486 --> 00:38:42,454
(laughs)

956
00:38:42,488 --> 00:38:44,656
Congratulations.
Thanks.

957
00:38:55,567 --> 00:38:58,970
So, my guardian angel, I think
this calls for a celebration.

958
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:01,707
I was lucky you turned up
when you did.

959
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:04,042
How did you find me,
by the way?

960
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:07,112
Location service on one
of your dating apps.

961
00:39:07,145 --> 00:39:08,246
(laughs)

962
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:12,618
Maybe luck had nothing to do
with when I showed up, Luci.

963
00:39:12,651 --> 00:39:14,453
Maybe Father wanted me there.

964
00:39:14,486 --> 00:39:17,889
You give him
way too much credit, Brother.

965
00:39:17,923 --> 00:39:20,726
(laughs)

966
00:39:20,759 --> 00:39:22,060
What's so funny?

967
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:23,962
Well, nothing.

968
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:26,598
It's just, it took you
walking a mile in my shoes

969
00:39:26,632 --> 00:39:27,999
to prove my point to me.

970
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:29,868
Okay. And what point is that?

971
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:31,470
That I haven't changed.

972
00:39:31,503 --> 00:39:32,938
Wings,

973
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:35,140
no wings,
unable to show my true face...

974
00:39:35,173 --> 00:39:35,874
it doesn't matter.

975
00:39:35,907 --> 00:39:38,410
I'm exactly
who I always was.

976
00:39:38,444 --> 00:39:40,479
A punisher.

977
00:39:40,512 --> 00:39:42,748
And for reminding me of that,
I salute you.

978
00:39:42,781 --> 00:39:44,750
Oh, that's very kind of you.

979
00:39:44,783 --> 00:39:47,719
But, you see,
I don't think it was the human

980
00:39:47,753 --> 00:39:49,154
that you were trying
to punish today.

981
00:39:49,187 --> 00:39:51,423
Well, who else would I be trying
to punish?

982
00:39:51,457 --> 00:39:52,791
Yourself, Luci.

983
00:39:54,526 --> 00:39:56,928
For not being there for Chloe
when she was in danger

984
00:39:56,962 --> 00:39:59,130
because you care
about her deeply.

985
00:39:59,164 --> 00:40:00,999
(scoffs)

986
00:40:01,032 --> 00:40:03,001
And if that truly is the case,

987
00:40:03,034 --> 00:40:06,705
then you really have changed
from the old Lord of Hell.

988
00:40:07,706 --> 00:40:10,041
But this is good, Luci.

989
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:13,044
This is so good.

990
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:16,114
Because I've finally figured out
how you are my test.

991
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:19,885
You see,
Father wants me to just...

992
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:22,654
just be there for you.

993
00:40:22,688 --> 00:40:23,955
To have your back.

994
00:40:23,989 --> 00:40:26,958
Now that you're evolving.

995
00:40:35,834 --> 00:40:39,871
There was this, uh, soul that
I used to torture back in Hell.

996
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,810
And like a good masochist,
he'd call the shots.

997
00:40:44,843 --> 00:40:47,713
"Burn me."
"Freeze me."

998
00:40:47,746 --> 00:40:49,080
"Hurt me."

999
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:51,049
So, I did.

1000
00:40:51,082 --> 00:40:53,552
And this went on for centuries

1001
00:40:53,585 --> 00:40:56,488
until one day, for some reason,

1002
00:40:56,522 --> 00:41:00,258
he missed his daily punishment.

1003
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,260
And when I returned...

1004
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,462
he was crying.

1005
00:41:05,931 --> 00:41:09,835
"Please, my king," he said.

1006
00:41:09,868 --> 00:41:12,971
"Don't ever forget me again.

1007
00:41:13,004 --> 00:41:15,140
I promise I'll be good."

1008
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:22,180
It was then that I realized
he was so full of self-loathing,

1009
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:25,717
void of any
self-respect, that

1010
00:41:25,751 --> 00:41:28,954
no matter the depth
of my cruelty,

1011
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:33,224
whatever miniscule attention
I paid...

1012
00:41:33,258 --> 00:41:35,894
gave meaning to his...

1013
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:38,964
pointless existence.

1014
00:41:39,898 --> 00:41:43,234
Why are you telling me this?

1015
00:41:47,072 --> 00:41:49,775
Because he reminds me of you.

1016
00:41:52,778 --> 00:41:54,780
And you think I've changed?

1017
00:41:54,813 --> 00:41:59,017
You... the former angel,

1018
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:01,286
powerless and pathetic,

1019
00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:04,556
a disgraced failure
with no better way

1020
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:08,226
to spend your days than
yipping at my heels for scraps

1021
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:12,530
to remind you of a time
of when you once mattered.

1022
00:42:19,671 --> 00:42:21,573
Hmm.

1023
00:42:21,607 --> 00:42:23,541
I know what you're doing.

1024
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:30,816
And you can kill the messenger
if you must.

1025
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:34,920
But just know
that I am here for you.

1026
00:42:34,953 --> 00:42:37,055
* Cover me... *
* Keep it spiraling

1027
00:42:37,088 --> 00:42:42,828
* Keep it spiraling,
keep it spiraling *

1028
00:42:42,861 --> 00:42:44,362
* Keep it spiraling

1029
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:47,198
* Cover me... *
* Keep it spiraling

1030
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:53,204
* Keep it spiraling,
keep it spiraling... *

1031
00:42:53,238 --> 00:42:55,340
(yells)

1032
00:42:55,373 --> 00:43:00,612
* Keep it spiraling...

1033
00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:10,789
* I tried with open eyes
but I couldn't see. *
