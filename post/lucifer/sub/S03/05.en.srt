1
00:00:01,302 --> 00:00:03,504
Previously on Lucifer...
Someone's escaped from Hell.

2
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:05,639
Who has escaped Hell?
Mum.

3
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:07,641
All I've wanted is to
reunite our family.

4
00:00:07,675 --> 00:00:09,577
DAN:
I don't understand you.

5
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,145
All right, whatever
this is between us.

6
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:13,047
I like you.
What is she doing here?

7
00:00:13,081 --> 00:00:15,483
CHLOE: Charlotte Richards,
the defense attorney.

8
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:16,750
It appears you've been busy.

9
00:00:16,784 --> 00:00:18,752
I thought I'd dive
into my employment.

10
00:00:18,786 --> 00:00:21,089
It's not that hard
once you read the law books.

11
00:00:21,122 --> 00:00:21,989
So, what happened?

12
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,157
Well, I cut a hole
in space and time,

13
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:25,426
Mum's light flooded through it,
then it closed up

14
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:26,794
behind her. All good.

15
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:27,661
Mom is gone?

16
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:28,362
LUCIFER:
Yes.

17
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:31,132
What is going on?
Who are you?

18
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:32,633
Detective, are you okay?

19
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:35,136
Yeah, I'm fine. I mean,
thanks to Lieutenant Pierce.

20
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:35,936
He saved my life.

21
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,171
DAN:
But don't worry, pal.

22
00:00:37,205 --> 00:00:38,239
Luckily, Pierce was with her.

23
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:40,208
But I wasn't.

24
00:00:41,442 --> 00:00:45,546
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

25
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:46,814
(chuckles)

26
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:48,682
Mmm!
(chuckles)

27
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:50,251
(doorbell buzzes)

28
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:53,221
Mmm, mmm. Mmm? Mmm!

29
00:00:53,254 --> 00:00:54,688
(chuckles)

30
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,225
Simon.

31
00:00:57,258 --> 00:00:58,326
Working late, huh?

32
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:00,128
Orders went up again.

33
00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:01,562
Got to make another batch.

34
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:02,396
Hmm.

35
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,565
If you don't
eat it all first, Lalo.

36
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:08,836
(chuckles)
Have fun cooking.

37
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:11,239
* I can hear dancing

38
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:13,207
* I can hear moonlight

39
00:01:13,241 --> 00:01:17,878
* I can hear footsteps following
you through the night *

40
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,348
* I can see chances

41
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:21,849
* I can see hazard lights

42
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:27,221
* I can see you and I
in the avenues of my mind *

43
00:01:27,255 --> 00:01:29,857
* Dark love light me up

44
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,359
* Light me up *

45
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:34,862
* Take me to the places
you're dreaming of *

46
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:35,796
* Light me up *

47
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:37,798
* Take me anywhere
that you choose. *

48
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:42,136
(footsteps echo)

49
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,637
Hello?

50
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,376
Somebody there?

51
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:51,879
(alert blaring)

52
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:00,454
(alert blaring louder)

53
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,235
BEATRICE:
Oh, hell.

54
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:15,403
CHLOE:
Trixie.

55
00:02:15,436 --> 00:02:18,239
But, Mom, I lost
Wonder Woman's lasso!

56
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:19,507
No excuses.

57
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,275
You know the rules.

58
00:02:21,309 --> 00:02:23,411
LUCIFER:
Ah, good morning,

59
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:25,446
Detective. Child.

60
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,714
Your text said
to meet you here.

61
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:29,517
Yeah, I don't think it said to
barge in like you own the place.

62
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,185
(chuckles)
Anyhow,

63
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:32,453
Pierce called from the hospital.

64
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:33,954
Because apparently
he never stops working.

65
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,022
But we have a new case.

66
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:37,358
What, "The Case of
the Missing Bedpan"? Riveting.

67
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:38,559
No, an actual case.

68
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:40,361
So, let's get moving.

69
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:42,363
Ah. Well, hello.

70
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:44,332
"Swear Jar"?

71
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:45,699
Oh, yes.

72
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:46,700
Trixie's...

73
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:49,437
You give your child money
every time she swears?

74
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,272
Oh, bravo, Detective.

75
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:53,541
No, no, no.
She pays

76
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:54,775
for every bad word she says.

77
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:56,677
Ah, well, then
I'm even more impressed.

78
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,912
Really? Thank you, Lucifer.

79
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:01,549
Impressed that you extort money
from your offspring.

80
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:02,950
(laughs): I mean,
what a ridiculous idea.

81
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:04,385
"Bad" words.

82
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:06,554
Determined by a set
of arbitrary rules.

83
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:08,222
Just like my Father's.

84
00:03:08,256 --> 00:03:09,590
Here, child.

85
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:11,625
This should buy you
plenty of juicy words.

86
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:12,793
You swear away.
Here, Trixie.

87
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:16,297
I am trying to get her
to stop swearing

88
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,431
and teach her
accountability.

89
00:03:17,465 --> 00:03:18,932
Ever heard of it?
Yes,

90
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:20,601
I have, actually,
and I happen to think

91
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,970
accountability is overrated.

92
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:24,805
I mean, take your almost
getting shot at the ranch.

93
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:25,839
At first, I felt bad

94
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,975
I wasn't there
to protect you.

95
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:29,977
Eh, what?
(clears throat)

96
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,312
(sighs)

97
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:32,413
You shouldn't have
felt bad.

98
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:33,581
Exactly.

99
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:34,815
Because accountability
is overrated.

100
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:36,950
No, because you don't
need to protect me.

101
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:38,886
And it wasn't your fault
to begin with.

102
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:39,887
You're right.

103
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,554
It was my Dad's fault.

104
00:03:40,588 --> 00:03:42,856
Oh-- what?
I mean, I'm sure

105
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,992
it was Him manipulating things
like He always does.

106
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:47,328
Try to teach me a lesson
about responsibility

107
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:48,729
or some nonsense like that.

108
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:50,864
Right, because that
makes more sense than someone

109
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:53,033
shooting at me because
I was about to arrest him.

110
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:53,967
I know!

111
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:56,437
And I am so over Him
getting in my head,

112
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,038
so, as of today, I have decided

113
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,375
I shall no longer be affected
by my Father's shenanigans.

114
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:03,444
Really?
Why do I doubt that?

115
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:04,778
But...

116
00:04:04,812 --> 00:04:06,980
Trixie, money in the jar,
then off to school.

117
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:10,684
Uh, child,

118
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:13,787
before you do that...

119
00:04:24,398 --> 00:04:25,799
ELLA:
Oy vay.

120
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,901
Someone forgot to exfoliate.

121
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:31,772
Victim's name
is Simon Fisher, 42.

122
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:35,075
Senior food chemist for
Performance Pudding Plus.

123
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,377
LUCIFER:
And apparently

124
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,945
a very clumsy one.

125
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:39,647
This wasn't an accident.

126
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,749
The irregular scuff marks,
those indicate a struggle.

127
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,584
Ella's working on
cause of death.

128
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,586
Well, he obviously drowned
in this vat of semen.

129
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,355
(chuckles)
It's pudding, Lucifer.

130
00:04:47,388 --> 00:04:49,590
Sure, I've heard it
called that, too.

131
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:50,558
ELLA:
Poor dude didn't drown.

132
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:53,527
And, aside from his
Freddy Krueger makeover,

133
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:55,529
no other wounds, so,

134
00:04:55,563 --> 00:04:57,798
my money's on death by scalding.

135
00:04:57,831 --> 00:04:58,766
Oh.
Can't be sure, though,

136
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,034
until we get him cleaned up
and autopsied.

137
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:04,338
Well, I'm sure our resident
pudding fan must be loving this.

138
00:05:04,372 --> 00:05:05,939
Don't even joke, man.

139
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:08,041
Pudding Plus
is my favorite, okay?

140
00:05:08,075 --> 00:05:11,712
Twice as much protein
as all the other brands.

141
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:13,947
Now with twice
as much dead guy.

142
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,416
Who found the body?

143
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:16,517
LALO:
I feel terrible.

144
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,985
If only I hadn't been

145
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:18,786
in the bathroom so long,

146
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,354
maybe I would have
heard something,

147
00:05:20,388 --> 00:05:21,722
seen something.

148
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:23,090
Maybe I could have
prevented this.

149
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:25,693
Quite a lot of security
just for pudding.

150
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:26,960
It's big business.

151
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,630
Thanks to the secret
recipe that Simon created.

152
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:32,533
Can't just let anyone peek
behind the curtain.

153
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:33,967
Right.
Well, we need to.

154
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:36,537
So, can you give us the access
to your security footage?

155
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,971
That's above my pay grade.

156
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,107
You'd have to talk to
the big man upstairs.

157
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,742
God?

158
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:43,877
Uh, no. The company's owner.

159
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:46,447
Oh. Right.

160
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,948
(chuckles)
His boss.

161
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,820
How can I even eat this
after what I've seen?

162
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:56,123
Is someone trying
to tell me something?

163
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:59,026
Well, if He is, don't let
Him inside your head.

164
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:01,462
Learn from my
mistakes, Daniel.

165
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:02,563
CHLOE:
Lucifer.

166
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:04,432
Yeah?
Adrian Yates,

167
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:05,599
the CEO of Pudding Plus,

168
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:06,667
is in the
conference room.

169
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,035
He brought his
security tapes.

170
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:08,869
Oh, excellent.

171
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:11,572
Who says solving murders
can't be easy?

172
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:15,876
Mr. Yates, thank
you for coming.

173
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:19,012
Your security footage will
be incredibly helpful.

174
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,481
Did you bring the tapes?

175
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:22,015
Sorry, but no.

176
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,584
What? Why not?

177
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:25,753
Because I told him not to.

178
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:26,820
I'm Mr. Yates' attorney

179
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:30,724
and the LAPD isn't laying
a finger on those tapes.

180
00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:34,695
Mum?

181
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,830
*

182
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:45,806
(distant siren wailing)

183
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:52,179
(alarm clock buzzing)

184
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:54,715
(sighs)

185
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:58,085
*

186
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,791
* The devil's in the details

187
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:05,893
* So is the truth

188
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,832
* I like to think I'm more

189
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:13,834
* Than how I cut my hair

190
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:20,941
* Theatrics, distractions

191
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:23,711
* That's how we've learned
to smile *

192
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:31,184
You are not crazy.

193
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:34,722
No one knows you can't remember
the last few months.

194
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:37,491
You will pretend that you do.

195
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:39,493
Own it.

196
00:07:39,527 --> 00:07:41,595
(sighs)

197
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:44,498
You will not...
(chuckles)

198
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:47,968
not give them a reason to
put you in a padded cell.

199
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:51,872
You look surprised to see me.

200
00:07:53,741 --> 00:07:54,675
Charlotte,

201
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:59,613
we... just didn't expect
to see you so soon.

202
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:02,550
Thought your brush with death
might have changed you.

203
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:03,751
It has.

204
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:05,118
(briefcase pops)

205
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,053
Hasn't it?

206
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:07,120
Back to being

207
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:07,921
Charlotte Richards?

208
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:09,690
Right?

209
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:11,625
Why are you here?
Apparently,

210
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:14,628
someone was trying to speak
to my client without counsel.

211
00:08:14,662 --> 00:08:17,798
I am here to inform you that
a stunt like that won't stand,

212
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:20,300
nor will your request
for any security footage.

213
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,803
We just wanted Mr. Yates' help.

214
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:23,937
A friendly conversation,

215
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:26,707
but this makes it seem
like you're hiding something.

216
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,875
LUCIFER:
Yes.

217
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:30,177
An ulterior motive for
being here, perhaps?

218
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,244
Excuse me?

219
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:33,614
It's awfully curious timing,
you back in my life

220
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:34,948
with everything
that's happening.

221
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:37,985
(chuckles)

222
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,753
This is about me, isn't it?

223
00:08:39,787 --> 00:08:44,024
If this was a social visit,
you would most certainly know.

224
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,728
And what we're hiding
is Pudding Plus'

225
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:49,262
proprietary recipe.

226
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:50,998
Releasing those tapes
would reveal

227
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,032
how their pudding is made,

228
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:55,135
committing their secret formula
to public record,

229
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:57,270
which could cost the company
millions.

230
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:59,740
Besides, the killer's not
on any of the footage anyway.

231
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:00,974
Mr. Yates, it's best
if I do the talking.

232
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:03,310
But all that you can see is that
there's some sort of scuffle

233
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:04,912
out of frame.
The killer's

234
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:06,179
not visible from
any of the angles.

235
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:07,848
Okay, so, see,
that there.

236
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,783
That's a clue.
That means the killer

237
00:09:09,817 --> 00:09:12,319
knew how to avoid
the cameras.

238
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:13,320
This could be an inside job.

239
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:14,287
Who-who has access to the lab?

240
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:15,288
I'm assuming you're
at the top of that list.

241
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:18,659
All right, Detective,
you can stop right there.

242
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:20,127
Mr. Yates, not a word.

243
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,862
We're done here.

244
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,598
But, (chuckles)
I'm not done with you.

245
00:09:24,632 --> 00:09:28,101
Which part of my briefcase
closing do you not understand?

246
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:29,169
Uh...

247
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:33,073
Still waiting
for Pudding Man's autopsy.

248
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:35,676
Cleaning that tasty treat
off a boiled corpse--

249
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:37,244
tougher than you'd imagine.

250
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:39,680
I'd rather not imagine,
actually.

251
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:40,580
Adrian, I'm telling...

252
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:42,883
Oh, hey,

253
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,686
let's go somewhere
that's not here,

254
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:47,120
like... over there.

255
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:48,922
I hear over there
is really nice.

256
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,359
(Dan clears throat)

257
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:53,661
Hi.

258
00:09:53,694 --> 00:09:55,095
Hello.

259
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:01,902
(sighs)

260
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,971
Did you see that?

261
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:08,909
She barely even looked at me.

262
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,712
It's like she's a completely
different person.

263
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:13,246
Yes, very perceptive,
Daniel.

264
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,783
What worries me is:
why is she here?

265
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:17,217
What's her angle?

266
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:22,222
Dude, I cannot deal
with your weirdness right now.

267
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:23,857
Yeah.

268
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:28,662
MAN:
First A.D.!

269
00:10:28,696 --> 00:10:31,098
(tapping keys)
So, I found seven
Pudding Plus employees

270
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,033
with keycard access
to the lab.

271
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:36,236
Unfortunately, all seven,
including Adrian Yates,

272
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:38,138
have solid alibis.
You don't say.

273
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:40,674
But I did find one other person
with a keycard,

274
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:44,144
an old one-- Adrian's former
business partner, Grace Foley.

275
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:46,013
She left the company
two years ago

276
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:48,716
to start her own
rival pudding company,

277
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:50,684
Heavenly Pudding.
Fascinating.

278
00:10:50,718 --> 00:10:53,420
Yeah, they're shooting their
ad campaign here on Stage 69.

279
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:54,354
Mm-hmm.

280
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:55,956
Should be just past
the creepy flasher.

281
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,025
LUCIFER:
That's nice.

282
00:10:58,058 --> 00:10:59,359
Lucifer, I know you're not
listening to me.

283
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:01,028
Creepy flasher? Stage 69?

284
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:03,063
69? What-- where?

285
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:05,065
I reversed the numbers
to get your attention.

286
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:07,067
And what is so important
on your phone?

287
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,101
I'm trying to reach

288
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:10,403
Charlotte Richards.
She won't answer my calls

289
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:12,039
or respond to my texts.

290
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:13,874
Why are you so obsessed
with your stepmom?

291
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:15,042
I need to talk to her,
get to the bottom

292
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:16,009
of why she's returned.

293
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:18,245
Well, to represent her client.
That's why.

294
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:19,446
(sighs)
No, no.

295
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:20,914
It has to be more than that.

296
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:23,216
I mean, right when
I'm dealing with...

297
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,119
...with complications
my Father's thrown my way?

298
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,121
No, her return has to be
another one of His grenades.

299
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:30,157
Well, I thought you were done
being affected

300
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,191
by your father's "shenanigans,"

301
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:32,125
over him
"getting in your head."

302
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:34,461
You're right.
I did say that, didn't I?

303
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:36,463
Yes.
Okay.

304
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:37,765
Okay, fine.

305
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:38,966
I am not thinking about Dad.

306
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:41,201
Not thinking about Charlotte.

307
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:43,003
It's not working.
Why is it not working?

308
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,171
Maybe you need a distraction.

309
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,472
Something else
to focus on.

310
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:48,008
LUCIFER:
Detective.

311
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,378
You have never been more right.

312
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:53,513
But... No, I meant the ca...

313
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,915
To focus on the case.

314
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:57,050
(photographer speaking
indistinctly)

315
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:04,357
That's it.

316
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,093
What the...?

317
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:09,362
Not at all accurate, but...

318
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,198
I approve.

319
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,199
* I'm done pretending...

320
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:15,836
Unless Dad has something
to do with this as well.

321
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:17,270
Ugh!

322
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:21,942
So conflicted,
but... can't look away.

323
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:23,176
(exhales)

324
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:29,516
*

325
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:34,421
* I'm never gonna give you up

326
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:37,825
* It's heavy

327
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:42,462
* Heavy how I want you so bad

328
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:45,398
* Heavy when it
hits me so fast *

329
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:51,038
* Heavy and it's
driving me mad *

330
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,273
* That I'm never
gonna give you up... *

331
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:54,007
GRACE:
No! No, no, no, no!

332
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,508
More! More!

333
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:56,509
Oh, come on.

334
00:12:56,543 --> 00:12:58,045
(bell ringing)
I need more
pudding! More.

335
00:12:58,078 --> 00:12:59,212
I want pudding everywhere.

336
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:01,081
This is a pudding commercial.

337
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,450
I can't sell the pudding
if I can't see the pudding.

338
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:04,551
And I want more pudding

339
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:06,553
in-- what's her name--
blondie's mouth.

340
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:09,256
I don't care if she can't
breathe. Go, now.

341
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,357
Excuse me.
Geez.

342
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,560
Grace Foley?
Wha-- why are your
clothes still on?

343
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:15,863
I ask myself that all the time.

344
00:13:15,896 --> 00:13:18,365
LAPD. We have some
questions for you.

345
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:21,101
CHLOE: How well
did you know Mr. Fisher?

346
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,302
GRACE:
Simon?

347
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:23,570
I'd been trying
to poach that genius

348
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:25,172
ever since I started
my own company.

349
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:26,206
LUCIFER:
Then what?

350
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:27,474
You got tired of him
rejecting you,

351
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:29,476
so you snuck into his lab and...

352
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:34,281
licked the pudding off every
inch of his beautiful...

353
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,182
Please.

354
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:37,951
(inhales)
You-- sorry.

355
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:39,086
You think I killed him?

356
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:41,254
Vengeance, corporate sabotage,
all in one fell swoop?

357
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:42,890
It makes sense.
(laughing):
Okay.

358
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:46,259
Even if I did kill him,
which I did not,

359
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:47,460
you really think

360
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,362
I'm dumb enough
to admit it?

361
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:51,965
Especially without
my lawyer present?

362
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:55,568
Speaking of, let's get her
down here, shall we?

363
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:57,170
What?

364
00:13:57,204 --> 00:13:58,872
She wants her lawyer here.

365
00:13:58,906 --> 00:13:59,940
So?
So,

366
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:02,409
maybe you should find out
what she desires more?

367
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:03,610
Oh, you want me to...

368
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:05,078
Just, yes.
Okay, then.

369
00:14:05,112 --> 00:14:06,313
Why didn't you just ask?

370
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:07,514
Ms. Foley.

371
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:10,150
Personal space.
Ever heard of it?

372
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,385
You don't want to call
your lawyer, do you?

373
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:14,955
What are you doing?

374
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:16,156
Come on, tell me
what you really want.

375
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,958
What's your greatest desire?

376
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:20,994
My greatest desire...

377
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:22,629
is to...

378
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:26,199
stop shooting
this exploitative garbage.

379
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:27,434
Garbage?

380
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,302
What are you talking about?

381
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:31,104
What you're doing is art.

382
00:14:31,138 --> 00:14:31,905
Is it, though?

383
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:33,106
Well, despite
the unwelcome reminder

384
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,041
of Dad and my wings,

385
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:35,608
I've never wanted pudding
more in my life.

386
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:36,543
Exactly.

387
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:40,080
Because we're selling sex--

388
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:42,182
which has absolutely nothing

389
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,616
to do with pudding--

390
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,452
to distract people
from the fact

391
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:48,355
that my pudding
tastes like crap.

392
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,656
Ooh, that's an odd choice
of flavors.

393
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:50,991
CHLOE: Well, even
more motive for you

394
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:52,125
to sneak into the lab,

395
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,260
steal the secret recipe.

396
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:55,062
What? Did Simon just get
in your way?

397
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:58,431
I didn't need
to steal their recipe.

398
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:01,301
Simon offered to sell it
to me three days ago.

399
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:02,302
What?

400
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:04,471
But then, before I could agree
to his terms,

401
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:07,707
he was murdered and not by me.

402
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,643
More than anyone,
I needed Simon alive.

403
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:15,582
(bell rings)

404
00:15:17,985 --> 00:15:20,420
If Simon was selling
the secret recipe,

405
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:22,655
then this may not be
about corporate sabotage

406
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:25,158
as much as
corporate espionage.

407
00:15:25,192 --> 00:15:30,163
If Adrian found out, he'd
want to stop Simon and...

408
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:31,164
Hello.

409
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:33,400
Hi again.
What's your name?

410
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,168
Ugh.
(model speaks
indistinctly)

411
00:15:35,202 --> 00:15:36,703
Really?
Good to see you.

412
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:38,505
It suits you,
that name, doesn't it?

413
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:42,142
(Lucifer speaking
indistinctly)

414
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,182
(laughing):
Really? Can I?

415
00:15:49,216 --> 00:15:51,418
Lucifer.

416
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,987
Can you come here?
One moment.

417
00:15:54,021 --> 00:15:55,588
Yes?

418
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,257
So, I'm gonna ask
Grace a follow-up.

419
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,425
Why don't you

420
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:02,529
take your new friend and escort
her back to her trailer?

421
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:04,497
Her trailer?
Are you suggesting...?

422
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:07,600
Who are you and what have you
done with the detective?

423
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:10,003
Put this on her. She looks cold.

424
00:16:10,037 --> 00:16:11,104
Copy that.

425
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:13,540
Darling, would you like
to take five in the trailers?

426
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:17,744
And that's really why I just
need to speak to the woman

427
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:20,080
whose body once housed
my mother's soul.

428
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:22,049
I don't believe it.
He's doing it again, isn't He?

429
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:23,383
Who?
Dad.

430
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:24,451
He's in my head,

431
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,020
ruining this moment that
you and I could be having.

432
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:28,455
I do apologize.

433
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:31,758
LAPD. Don't move.

434
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,726
Let me guess. You work
for Adrian Yates.

435
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,595
Think you've got me confused
with somebody else, lady.

436
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:37,364
CHLOE:
I don't think I do.

437
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:38,765
Saw you watching us earlier.

438
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,433
Detective,
what's happening?

439
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:41,568
Sometimes big
corporations, they have

440
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:45,372
fixers on their payroll to
prevent corporate espionage.

441
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:46,573
Or clever detectives

442
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:48,775
from learning
about said espionage.

443
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:50,777
I'm not saying anything
more without my lawyer.

444
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,146
LUCIFER:
Ah, wonderful.

445
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,181
Well, if he works for Yates,

446
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:56,449
that means his lawyer is
Charlotte Richards, right?

447
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:12,031
You said there was
someone to see me.

448
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,267
Oh.

449
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:15,602
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

450
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:18,205
Is there something
I can help you with?

451
00:17:19,306 --> 00:17:21,074
Yeah.

452
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:23,543
Answers.

453
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:25,178
What's with the cold shoulder,
Charlotte?

454
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:27,614
Not just back at the
precinct, but my calls--

455
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:29,549
you haven't returned
any of them.

456
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:32,152
I'm sorry.
I've been incredibly busy.

457
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:34,254
All that time,

458
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:36,223
what did you think we were?

459
00:17:37,324 --> 00:17:39,192
What did you think we were?

460
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:41,394
(scoffs)

461
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:43,796
I have no freakin' clue.

462
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,432
I...

463
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:46,699
You seduce me.

464
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,301
You hack into my phone.

465
00:17:48,335 --> 00:17:50,303
You become a suspect in a case.

466
00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:53,206
You tell me I'm
your-your favorite human,

467
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,641
whatever that means.

468
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:56,409
You almost die,

469
00:17:56,443 --> 00:17:57,477
and then you ghost me for weeks.

470
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,612
Nothing about any of that
makes any sense to me.

471
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:02,081
I'm sorry, Detective Espinoza.

472
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,851
Dan.

473
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:07,820
It doesn't make
any sense to me either.

474
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:11,658
Whether you understand it
or not,

475
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:14,527
you don't just pretend
like it... never happened.

476
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:18,398
You know what,

477
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,233
I'm just... I'm
gonna let it go.

478
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:22,169
I'm gonna let Lucifer
deal with you,

479
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:24,337
because he's the only
one who ever really...

480
00:18:24,371 --> 00:18:26,873
I guess, understood what
you were up to anyways.

481
00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:29,576
So, Lucifer and I were close?

482
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:33,380
Oh, in ways that
I'll never understand.

483
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:38,885
(elevator bell dings)

484
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:42,355
Yes, I-I completely understand,
and I will

485
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:43,756
definitely talk to Trixie.

486
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,492
This won't happen again.

487
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:47,494
Thanks.

488
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:49,562
That was Trixie's school
calling.

489
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:50,730
Apparently, she's been using

490
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,732
some very creative language
today.

491
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:54,267
Oh. Do tell.

492
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:56,936
Well, she called her math
homework a "cluster duck"

493
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,805
and her teacher
a "mother flunker."

494
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:00,807
Did she not call anyone a
"sock sucker"? (chuckles)

495
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,776
What? It's just someone
who sucks socks. (chuckles)

496
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,778
I can't believe
you're teaching my daughter

497
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,380
loophole swear words.

498
00:19:07,414 --> 00:19:08,648
In my defense,

499
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:10,917
"mother flunker" was entirely
the little deviant's creation.

500
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,685
And very clever
of her, I might add.

501
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:13,586
That's not the point.

502
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,355
I'm trying to teach my child
a lesson,

503
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:17,890
and you just made my job
that much more difficult.

504
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:19,926
You parents,
always with your lessons.

505
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:22,395
Or as I like to call
them, mind games.

506
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:26,366
Well, I'm about to get to the
bottom of my Father's latest.

507
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,369
It's Charlotte time!

508
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:30,503
You're not Charlotte.

509
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:34,374
And yet people get us
confused, like, all the time.

510
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:35,908
(chuckles)
Hi. Larry.

511
00:19:35,942 --> 00:19:40,280
Charlotte is busy at the moment,
so Richards and Wheeler sent me.

512
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:42,282
(sighs)

513
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:44,251
Mother flunker.

514
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:46,386
Where are you going?

515
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:47,887
Well, I only came
to see Charlotte.

516
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,822
Besides, having me here
would just make your job

517
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,724
"that much more difficult,"
wouldn't it?

518
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:53,860
* Oh...

519
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:57,330
(siren wailing in distance)
* Oh

520
00:19:57,364 --> 00:20:00,600
* Oh...

521
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:03,436
* Oh

522
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,637
* Oh...

523
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:07,774
Well, hello.

524
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,310
* You are the sound of rain

525
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:11,878
What...

526
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:14,314
what are you doing here?

527
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:15,748
* And close a shadow...

528
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:17,016
(chuckles)

529
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,753
I knew it. You are back
for a reason, aren't you?

530
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:23,390
Hmm? Hey?

531
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,891
Come on, tell me.
Why are you here?

532
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:26,793
* There's a devil
in your eyes... *

533
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:28,695
Mm! Mm!
(moans)

534
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,801
(muffled protesting)

535
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:36,869
What in Dad's name
are you doing?!

536
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:39,806
(chuckles) Don't pretend
you didn't like that.

537
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,708
Well, I most
certainly did not.
Lucifer,

538
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,410
I know we were close.

539
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:45,345
Not that close.
Oh, no sense in being coy.

540
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:47,414
We're all alone here.
Mm!

541
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:50,583
(discordant notes)
(muffled protesting)

542
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:52,952
No, no, no, no, no!

543
00:20:54,654 --> 00:20:56,255
No!

544
00:20:58,725 --> 00:21:01,361
I...
(chuckles)

545
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:02,895
I don't understand.

546
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:05,732
You couldn't keep your eyes
off me at the precinct.

547
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:10,269
Your desperate messages,
needing to see me.

548
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:14,774
D-Detective Espinoza...

549
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:18,010
heartbroken
because we were close.

550
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:21,381
For the f...
first time

551
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:22,982
since I woke up on that beach,
I thought,

552
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:24,684
"Finally,
something that makes sense.

553
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:28,921
Of course I'm sleeping with
Mr. Tall, Dark and Handsome."

554
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,790
Uh... uh...
But now
you're saying

555
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:33,059
that's not...
not even that's the case?

556
00:21:33,092 --> 00:21:34,093
(chuckles)

557
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:37,364
Look, I can assure you
that you and I have not

558
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:40,933
or will not ever,
ever, ever...

559
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,602
sleep together.

560
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:45,738
Well, if not lovers,
then what were we, friends?

561
00:21:45,772 --> 00:21:47,340
More like...

562
00:21:47,374 --> 00:21:48,741
(panting)

563
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:51,611
...family.

564
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,946
*

565
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,915
(sobs):
I can't ta...

566
00:21:55,948 --> 00:21:58,050
can't take this anymore.

567
00:22:01,721 --> 00:22:02,989
(exhales)

568
00:22:04,457 --> 00:22:06,759
(sighs)

569
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,701
I'm...

570
00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:17,804
I'm missing time.

571
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:19,572
Months...

572
00:22:19,606 --> 00:22:21,974
and months of time.

573
00:22:23,443 --> 00:22:25,111
It's like...

574
00:22:25,144 --> 00:22:28,080
someone else was living my life.

575
00:22:28,114 --> 00:22:29,916
Ruining it.

576
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:31,684
My work...

577
00:22:31,718 --> 00:22:34,721
my relationships, my...

578
00:22:34,754 --> 00:22:36,823
my family.

579
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:42,995
I have no idea...

580
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:46,032
why my husband got custody
of the kids.

581
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:49,669
Or why I've been...

582
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,904
denied visitation rights.

583
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:59,679
But ever since I woke up
on that beach...

584
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:02,615
I've been pretending...

585
00:23:02,649 --> 00:23:03,816
like I remember it all,

586
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:07,420
(laughs): because otherwise
everyone would think that...

587
00:23:07,454 --> 00:23:09,388
that I'm crazy.

588
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:14,527
Maybe I am.

589
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:18,531
You're not crazy.

590
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:22,835
(sighs)

591
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:25,204
You're just an innocent,
aren't you?

592
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,874
Caught up in a game
not of your own.

593
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:30,843
Oh, believe me,
I'm not innocent.

594
00:23:30,877 --> 00:23:32,178
(exhales)

595
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:35,548
But I don't think I deserve...

596
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:37,416
What?

597
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:41,053
In my m...

598
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:44,791
my missing time...

599
00:23:44,824 --> 00:23:46,926
it feels like I was...

600
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:48,528
trapped...

601
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:50,897
in some...

602
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,065
horrible nightmare,

603
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:55,668
reliving it over and over and...

604
00:23:55,702 --> 00:23:58,671
over again.

605
00:23:58,705 --> 00:24:00,907
It feels almost like I was in...

606
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,575
Hell?

607
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:04,210
(laughs softly)

608
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:07,547
Now you probably think
I'm crazy, too.

609
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,917
Do you realize
who you're talking to?

610
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,019
Right. Lucifer.

611
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:14,754
(chuckles, sniffles)

612
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,088
The Devil.

613
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:18,090
Yeah, well, if you believe me,

614
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,126
then you're
just as crazy as I am.

615
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,029
Or perhaps you knew
exactly where you were.

616
00:24:23,062 --> 00:24:25,131
Why would I go to Hell?

617
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:27,767
It's not like I'm a bad person.

618
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,101
I work hard.

619
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:31,804
Pay my taxes.
Don't hurt anyone.

620
00:24:31,838 --> 00:24:33,239
(chuckles softly)

621
00:24:33,272 --> 00:24:36,943
Well, perhaps you feel
more guilt than you realize.

622
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,283
Well, on the ridiculous...

623
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:48,120
off chance that Hell
actually is possible...

624
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:51,691
how do I make sure
I never go back?

625
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:53,793
(chuckles)

626
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:57,730
Well, uh, this is
your second chance, correct?

627
00:24:57,764 --> 00:25:00,066
So perhaps
avoid doing

628
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:02,301
devious and dastardly things
from now on.

629
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,737
I mean, it's boring, I know.

630
00:25:04,771 --> 00:25:06,639
(chuckles softly)

631
00:25:06,673 --> 00:25:08,174
Does...

632
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:12,078
knowingly impeding
a homicide investigation count?

633
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,081
Uh...

634
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:21,921
Why does stuff like this
always happen to me?
Because you are

635
00:25:21,954 --> 00:25:25,758
a softy, Dan-- it's
one of the many things
I love about you.

636
00:25:25,792 --> 00:25:27,159
No, what I am is a dummy.

637
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:29,996
She acts like I barely exist,
so what do I do?

638
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,664
I go to her office

639
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:32,899
to get rejected again.

640
00:25:32,932 --> 00:25:34,701
You're being too hard
on yourself.

641
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:38,771
And eating your emotions?
I thought you were

642
00:25:38,805 --> 00:25:39,639
giving that stuff up.

643
00:25:39,672 --> 00:25:42,975
I can't just quit
cold turkey, Ella.

644
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:44,577
Not at a time like this.

645
00:25:44,611 --> 00:25:46,579
Hey, it could
always be worse.

646
00:25:46,613 --> 00:25:48,314
You could end up
like our vic here.

647
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:49,782
Guess what his autopsy found.

648
00:25:49,816 --> 00:25:52,284
Couple of kidney stones
the size of golf balls.

649
00:25:53,352 --> 00:25:54,721
Ouch.

650
00:25:54,754 --> 00:25:56,989
Dude was suffering
from intense renal failure.

651
00:25:57,023 --> 00:25:59,158
I mean, even he hadn't
been pudding'd alive,

652
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:02,795
he would have died within days
from urinary sepsis.

653
00:26:02,829 --> 00:26:04,330
What are the odds,

654
00:26:04,363 --> 00:26:06,999
two horrible ways of dying
hitting the same person

655
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:08,935
around the same time?

656
00:26:08,968 --> 00:26:11,804
That's a good point.

657
00:26:11,838 --> 00:26:13,773
What are the odds?

658
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:16,242
It says here that Pudding Plus
employs you to handle

659
00:26:16,275 --> 00:26:18,010
their corporate security.

660
00:26:18,044 --> 00:26:19,879
And I know that
Simon Fisher

661
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,948
compromised that security
by trying to sell

662
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:23,716
your company's
most valuable secret

663
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,151
to the other side.

664
00:26:25,184 --> 00:26:26,686
So?
So...

665
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:29,656
would you consider
Mr. Fisher "handled"?

666
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:31,958
My client doesn't need
to respond to that.

667
00:26:31,991 --> 00:26:33,693
You're right.

668
00:26:33,726 --> 00:26:36,028
I guess we'll just leave it
to a jury.

669
00:26:36,062 --> 00:26:38,798
There is no "other side."

670
00:26:39,866 --> 00:26:41,300
Excuse me?

671
00:26:42,368 --> 00:26:44,236
I guess Grace
forgot to mention,

672
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,372
as of a month ago,
Pudding Plus

673
00:26:46,405 --> 00:26:48,841
and Heavenly Pudding
decided to merge.

674
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,844
Tell her.

675
00:26:51,878 --> 00:26:53,245
It's true.
And also

676
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,982
not illegal--
last time I checked.

677
00:26:56,015 --> 00:26:58,084
Richards and Wheeler
are representing

678
00:26:58,117 --> 00:26:59,786
the merged company.

679
00:26:59,819 --> 00:27:02,021
So whatever threat
Fisher posed by selling

680
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:04,190
his recipe
to the "other side," gone.

681
00:27:04,223 --> 00:27:06,158
No motive for murder.

682
00:27:06,192 --> 00:27:07,760
Then why were you following me?

683
00:27:07,794 --> 00:27:10,296
I didn't know where
your investigation was going.

684
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:13,866
Couldn't let Fisher's death
threaten the merger.

685
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,869
Do you know how much money
is in pudding?

686
00:27:16,903 --> 00:27:18,204
(door opens)
Detective.

687
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:20,940
You're needed
in the conference room.

688
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,174
LUCIFER:
Ah.

689
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:24,143
Detective, look who I found.

690
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:26,012
And she comes
bearing gifts.

691
00:27:26,045 --> 00:27:27,146
The security footage

692
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:28,414
you requested.

693
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:29,716
Why are you handing
this over now?

694
00:27:29,749 --> 00:27:32,218
You seemed so opposed
to it earlier.
Well, it's recently come

695
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:35,021
to my attention that
I need to make a change.

696
00:27:35,054 --> 00:27:36,756
So I'm trying to do
what's right.

697
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:39,158
If I can prove
my client is innocent

698
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:41,227
and help you find
your killer...

699
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,395
clean conscience,
here I come.

700
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:44,931
Huh.

701
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:04,817
You can't see
the killer here.

702
00:28:04,851 --> 00:28:06,252
Just as my client said.

703
00:28:06,285 --> 00:28:08,087
All this video shows
is what we already know--

704
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,456
that someone familiar
with the cameras
went into this room

705
00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:12,792
and pushed Simon
into the vat.

706
00:28:12,825 --> 00:28:14,794
Yeah, but everyone
with access had alibis.

707
00:28:14,827 --> 00:28:16,395
LUCIFER:
Oh, you're not
suggesting a murderer

708
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:18,164
actually lied about
where they were?

709
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:18,865
Daniel.

710
00:28:18,898 --> 00:28:21,333
We double-checked them, okay?

711
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:23,369
They're all
pretty ironclad.

712
00:28:25,171 --> 00:28:26,705
Hmm.

713
00:28:27,774 --> 00:28:29,375
Oh, my gosh.

714
00:28:30,843 --> 00:28:32,378
Of course.

715
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:35,147
What?

716
00:28:35,181 --> 00:28:36,348
What the hell, Ella?

717
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:37,249
ELLA:
You're welcome.

718
00:28:37,283 --> 00:28:38,284
I just saved your life.

719
00:28:38,317 --> 00:28:39,085
Check it out.

720
00:28:39,118 --> 00:28:41,220
Two other
secret ingredients, right?

721
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:43,255
Melamine and cyanuric acid.

722
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:44,891
Separate,
both are harmless.

723
00:28:44,924 --> 00:28:47,493
But when combined, they create
a hard-to-detect toxin

724
00:28:47,526 --> 00:28:50,029
that, over time, can cause--
drumroll, please--

725
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:51,363
renal failure.

726
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:52,932
The kidney stones you found.

727
00:28:52,965 --> 00:28:57,069
Yeah. Looks like the "plus"
in Pudding Plus...

728
00:28:57,103 --> 00:28:58,304
is poison.

729
00:29:04,944 --> 00:29:06,278
DAN: Poisonous pudding?
Are you kidding me?

730
00:29:06,312 --> 00:29:08,214
So, Simon must have gotten sick

731
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:09,348
from his constant
exposure to it?

732
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:11,884
Well, what kind of idiot would
intentionally put poison

733
00:29:11,918 --> 00:29:13,886
in their own product?
These two chemicals
have been known

734
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,056
to fake the appearance
of a higher protein content.

735
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:19,391
Which is Pudding Plus'
biggest selling point.
But wouldn't people

736
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:21,260
eventually realize
that it's poisonous?

737
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:23,362
I mean, the company
would lose everything.
Not necessarily.

738
00:29:23,395 --> 00:29:25,197
If you have hundreds
of millions of dollars,

739
00:29:25,231 --> 00:29:27,266
and you get sued
for a couple of million,

740
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:29,168
you still have hundreds
of millions of dollars.

741
00:29:29,201 --> 00:29:31,503
But people die.
Yeah, well,

742
00:29:31,537 --> 00:29:33,806
it's the same calculation
the car manufacturers make

743
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,075
when they find out
they have faulty airbags.

744
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:38,878
Which costs them less,
recalling the car

745
00:29:38,911 --> 00:29:40,913
or enduring the lawsuits?

746
00:29:40,947 --> 00:29:42,281
ELLA: Yeah,
but why would Simon

747
00:29:42,314 --> 00:29:45,151
try to sell the formula to Grace
if it was killing him?

748
00:29:45,184 --> 00:29:46,018
Unless he didn't.

749
00:29:46,052 --> 00:29:47,553
Maybe when he found out
what he created,

750
00:29:47,586 --> 00:29:48,988
he was just trying to stop it.

751
00:29:49,021 --> 00:29:50,189
LUCIFER:
And who better to expose

752
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:51,257
Pudding Plus' dirty secret

753
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,892
than their biggest
competitor?

754
00:29:52,925 --> 00:29:54,093
But Simon
didn't know.

755
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:55,294
the two companies were merging.

756
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:57,163
Soon they won't be
in competition.

757
00:29:57,196 --> 00:29:58,898
DAN: Suddenly,
everyone has motive

758
00:29:58,931 --> 00:30:00,032
to keep Simon quiet.

759
00:30:00,066 --> 00:30:01,500
Adrian, Grace and the fixer.

760
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:03,269
Three potential killers.

761
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:05,504
And as the merged
company's counsel...

762
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:07,473
you represent all of them.

763
00:30:11,911 --> 00:30:13,012
Charlotte,
where are you going?

764
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:15,447
To join the Peace Corps
or donate my entire savings

765
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:18,584
to an orphanage or build
a shelter for blind,
one-legged puppies.

766
00:30:18,617 --> 00:30:20,619
Well, as long as you're
not being overdramatic.

767
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,255
I thought delivering those tapes
would help clear my ledger.

768
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:25,992
But instead, it just revealed
that I've been defending

769
00:30:26,025 --> 00:30:27,259
three guilty people?

770
00:30:27,293 --> 00:30:28,594
Uh...
If that's true,

771
00:30:28,627 --> 00:30:30,362
how guilty does that make me?

772
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:35,601
(exhales)

773
00:30:37,937 --> 00:30:40,006
This isn't a good time.

774
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:41,640
I know how you've
been treating Dan.

775
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:44,210
Okay? And I want you to know
that I got his back.

776
00:30:44,243 --> 00:30:46,478
What's that mean?
I used to see

777
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:48,580
a light in you.

778
00:30:48,614 --> 00:30:51,483
But now, I don't know,
something's different.

779
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:54,053
All I see now...

780
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:56,055
is darkness.

781
00:31:02,094 --> 00:31:05,131
Oh, there you are.
Where'd you run off to?

782
00:31:05,164 --> 00:31:07,366
Just needed to
clear my head.

783
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:10,169
Do you think Charlotte
will be all right?
Yeah.

784
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:12,271
Why wouldn't she be?
That woman's like a rock.

785
00:31:12,304 --> 00:31:15,241
Like a very mean, scary, hot,

786
00:31:15,274 --> 00:31:16,909
well-dressed rock.

787
00:31:16,943 --> 00:31:20,512
Yes, well...
you'd be surprised, Detective.

788
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:21,447
Okay.

789
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,116
Well, now that we know
all three suspects

790
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,085
have the same motive-- money--

791
00:31:26,118 --> 00:31:28,287
I looked into
the company's financials

792
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,157
to see who had the most to lose
if the merger failed.

793
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:34,126
And get this--
it's none of our three.

794
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,095
You really think I killed Simon?

795
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:37,997
Lalo, we know you stood
to gain hundreds

796
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,266
of thousands of dollars
in vested stock options

797
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:43,669
once those two pudding
companies merged.
That's a lot of money.

798
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:45,137
For you. Obviously.

799
00:31:45,171 --> 00:31:47,273
But, uh, it all
would have disappeared

800
00:31:47,306 --> 00:31:50,109
had Simon revealed the truth
behind his illness.

801
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:52,011
You... you mean Simon
really was sick?

802
00:31:52,044 --> 00:31:53,179
You knew about that?

803
00:31:53,212 --> 00:31:55,381
Sure. He said
he was gonna die.

804
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,416
But I didn't take it seriously.

805
00:31:57,449 --> 00:32:00,119
He said a lot
of things that night.
What night?

806
00:32:00,152 --> 00:32:02,121
About a month ago,
we went out drinking.

807
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:03,522
Simon got wasted.

808
00:32:03,555 --> 00:32:06,125
He started going off
about how Mr. Yates

809
00:32:06,158 --> 00:32:07,393
wasn't listening to him,

810
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:09,528
and that people were
gonna suffer for it.

811
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:13,232
He said something about
how it was his own fault.

812
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:15,001
Simon said that...

813
00:32:15,034 --> 00:32:17,603
maybe he should just end it.

814
00:32:17,636 --> 00:32:19,138
End what?

815
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:20,406
His life.

816
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:22,141
Huh.

817
00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:24,443
I had no idea
what he was talking about.

818
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:26,445
And you didn't think
to tell us this sooner?

819
00:32:26,478 --> 00:32:28,447
Like when he
showed up dead?

820
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,051
A bunch of drunken nonsense?

821
00:32:32,084 --> 00:32:34,153
It's not like he jumped

822
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:35,587
into that vat.

823
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:37,623
I mean...

824
00:32:37,656 --> 00:32:40,259
boiling pudding?

825
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:42,995
There's easier ways to go.

826
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:45,031
But none so revealing.

827
00:32:45,064 --> 00:32:46,365
What?

828
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:48,067
What if this was
Simon's Hail Mary?

829
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,437
A way to expose the truth
that he felt so guilty about.

830
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,105
Oh, so you think
the man actually killed himself

831
00:32:53,139 --> 00:32:54,706
to lead us to the toxin?

832
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,408
Well, if he did, it worked.

833
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:00,479
The suicide version's
looking more and more likely.

834
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:03,115
Day before his death,
Simon changed his will.

835
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:04,350
He donated

836
00:33:04,383 --> 00:33:06,385
all his possessions to charity.

837
00:33:06,418 --> 00:33:08,754
He even gave away
his pet turtle.

838
00:33:08,787 --> 00:33:10,489
Huh.

839
00:33:10,522 --> 00:33:12,658
And the scuff marks
on the platform...

840
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:16,395
He must have faked a struggle
to make it look like a homicide.

841
00:33:16,428 --> 00:33:20,432
To keep us
investigating the companies.
Huh.

842
00:33:20,466 --> 00:33:21,767
WOMAN: Hello,
Charlotte Richards' office.

843
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,369
Charlotte, good news.

844
00:33:23,402 --> 00:33:24,736
It was a suicide.

845
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:26,505
So no need to worry.

846
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:28,307
You won't be representing
any murderers.

847
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,209
Charlotte just left.

848
00:33:30,242 --> 00:33:33,412
She went to meet some clients.

849
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:34,446
Why do I get the feeling

850
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,549
Charlotte's about
to do something very stupid?

851
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:45,791
So, what's this about?
Why the last-minute meeting?

852
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:47,126
Yeah, and why here?

853
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:48,694
Didn't we agree
to delay merger talk

854
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:52,198
until after the LAPD ends
their investigation?

855
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:55,234
We did. This meeting
is about other business.

856
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:57,236
Personal business.

857
00:33:57,269 --> 00:33:58,604
What the hell does that mean?

858
00:33:58,637 --> 00:34:00,439
No one's leaving here
until I figure out

859
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:03,442
which one of you
murdered Simon Fisher.

860
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:05,511
Um...

861
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:12,851
So, a funny thing happened

862
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,720
a couple of months ago.

863
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:17,489
I sort of died.

864
00:34:17,523 --> 00:34:21,327
And apparently
there's a chance I went to Hell.

865
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,528
Oh, I know. I was...

866
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,563
I was as shocked as you are.

867
00:34:24,596 --> 00:34:28,300
I'm feeling much better now.

868
00:34:28,334 --> 00:34:31,570
Thanks for asking.

869
00:34:31,603 --> 00:34:35,174
(chuckles):
Though there might be

870
00:34:35,207 --> 00:34:37,843
a slight chance

871
00:34:37,876 --> 00:34:40,546
that I'm having
a nervous breakdown

872
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,381
as we speak.

873
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:43,482
Anyhow...

874
00:34:43,515 --> 00:34:45,317
I've had some time to think,

875
00:34:45,351 --> 00:34:49,221
and I'm pretty sure that my sin

876
00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:50,856
was a lifetime of defending

877
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:53,359
known criminals and murderers.

878
00:34:53,392 --> 00:34:55,194
Apparently
nobody bothered to tell me

879
00:34:55,227 --> 00:34:56,762
that all the blood
that they shed

880
00:34:56,795 --> 00:34:58,730
is on my hands, too.

881
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:00,199
(chuckles nervously)

882
00:35:00,232 --> 00:35:03,235
Now, here I am

883
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:05,237
with a second chance,

884
00:35:05,271 --> 00:35:07,406
and one of you...

885
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:11,377
is screwing it up.

886
00:35:12,344 --> 00:35:13,812
So, speak.

887
00:35:16,215 --> 00:35:18,350
Which one of you killed Simon?

888
00:35:18,384 --> 00:35:20,686
Charlotte, none of us did it.
He's right.

889
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:23,422
No, I know that Simon
was about to blow the whistle

890
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:24,890
on your little secret.

891
00:35:24,923 --> 00:35:26,425
So one of you

892
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,126
must have done it.

893
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:33,299
FIXER:
Why are we still sitting here?

894
00:35:33,332 --> 00:35:35,234
I'm done
listening to this crazy bitch.

895
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:36,802
Sit down!

896
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:38,136
Why don't you make me?

897
00:35:38,837 --> 00:35:41,573
That can't be good.

898
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:45,711
What the hell? You
could have shot me.

899
00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:47,579
Very easily.

900
00:35:47,613 --> 00:35:48,580
Now sit.

901
00:35:48,614 --> 00:35:51,517
Look, lady, all I did
was intimidate Simon.

902
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,651
And I stopped as soon as Adrian

903
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:55,454
called me off. I was just
doing what he paid me to do.

904
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:56,955
W-We didn't need to kill Simon.

905
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,825
We kept him quiet.
A-And just sped up the merger.

906
00:35:59,858 --> 00:36:02,328
We were all set to
make record profits

907
00:36:02,361 --> 00:36:04,730
despite Simon's
nitpicky safety concerns.

908
00:36:04,763 --> 00:36:07,799
Yeah. Why would we go kill him
after all of that?

909
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,235
Well, I don't know.

910
00:36:09,268 --> 00:36:10,369
Loose ends, maybe?

911
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:13,239
I'm gonna make this right
one way

912
00:36:13,272 --> 00:36:15,441
or another.
Charlotte.

913
00:36:16,408 --> 00:36:17,543
Wait.

914
00:36:17,576 --> 00:36:19,811
Lucifer?
They're telling the truth.

915
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:22,848
None of these scoundrels
killed Simon.

916
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:24,416
He killed himself.

917
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:26,352
A dying man's plan
to expose the company

918
00:36:26,385 --> 00:36:27,753
and its crimes.

919
00:36:27,786 --> 00:36:30,822
(scoffs)
That doesn't make any sense.

920
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:32,591
Charlotte...

921
00:36:32,624 --> 00:36:34,726
they're innocent.

922
00:36:40,432 --> 00:36:42,401
No.

923
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:43,602
No, they're not.

924
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:45,671
Did you not hear
what I just said?

925
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:48,840
Oh, I heard.
So they didn't kill Simon.

926
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:51,610
What about everybody
who eats their stupid pudding?

927
00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:54,646
They all knew
their product was poisonous.

928
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:58,517
Innocent people are gonna die
because of them.

929
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,386
I've lived my life

930
00:37:00,419 --> 00:37:01,987
finding loopholes,

931
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,623
ways of evading responsibility
for my clients.

932
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:08,360
Myself.

933
00:37:08,394 --> 00:37:10,862
Turns out...

934
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:14,400
there are no loopholes.

935
00:37:14,433 --> 00:37:16,468
If you're guilty,

936
00:37:16,502 --> 00:37:19,271
you're guilty.

937
00:37:19,305 --> 00:37:20,572
I understand that you want

938
00:37:20,606 --> 00:37:21,773
to clear the red
from your ledger.

939
00:37:21,807 --> 00:37:25,711
But believe me, Charlotte,
this is not the way to do it.

940
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:28,347
Then what am I supposed to do?

941
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,316
I can't go...

942
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:33,018
I can't go back there.

943
00:37:33,051 --> 00:37:34,753
Can't.

944
00:37:36,655 --> 00:37:38,890
Then here's what you need to do,
Charlotte.

945
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:41,727
Trust me.

946
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:53,539
Thank you.

947
00:37:53,572 --> 00:37:56,308
What about them?

948
00:37:56,342 --> 00:37:57,676
Well...

949
00:37:57,709 --> 00:37:59,578
whilst I was lurking
in the shadows,

950
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,847
they said quite a few
incriminating things.

951
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,651
Detective, was that enough
for a proper perp walk of shame?

952
00:38:05,684 --> 00:38:08,286
CHLOE:
Yep, plenty.

953
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:13,925
FBI's gonna have a field day
with these recorded confessions.

954
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:15,927
You may not have pushed Simon
to his death,

955
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:17,996
but you'll pay for your role
in poisoning him.

956
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:24,336
Nice win, partner.
Thank you very much.

957
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:26,605
I'm just surprised you let me
enter the factory first.

958
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:28,440
Oh, I figured it was your turn
to get shot at.

959
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:31,410
Oh. (chuckles)
You know, you were
right about Charlotte.

960
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:33,412
There's more to her
than I thought.

961
00:38:33,445 --> 00:38:35,914
The things she said...
Sounded loony?

962
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:39,050
No. Sounded like
somebody wrestling

963
00:38:39,084 --> 00:38:40,519
with their demons.

964
00:38:45,391 --> 00:38:48,560
I couldn't help but overhear
what you said back there.

965
00:38:48,594 --> 00:38:50,696
Sounds like you're...

966
00:38:50,729 --> 00:38:53,098
going through a lot.

967
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:54,900
I'm sorry you're struggling.

968
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:55,801
You're right.

969
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:58,804
(chuckles):
I am going through a lot.

970
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,708
But that's no excuse
for how I've treated you.

971
00:39:02,741 --> 00:39:05,544
Well, I appreciate that.

972
00:39:05,577 --> 00:39:09,681
Maybe we could meet
for coffee sometime.

973
00:39:10,582 --> 00:39:12,684
Maybe.

974
00:39:14,586 --> 00:39:16,388
Hope I'm not interrupting
anything, Daniel.

975
00:39:16,422 --> 00:39:18,757
Charlotte, ready
for that ride home?

976
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,759
(sighs)

977
00:39:25,797 --> 00:39:29,868
CHLOE:
Trixie, can you come out here?

978
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:31,770
Hi, Mommy.

979
00:39:33,672 --> 00:39:35,674
Monkey, I want to talk to you

980
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,142
about what happened today
at school.

981
00:39:37,175 --> 00:39:39,010
Did you tell Miss Morgan

982
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:41,613
to "go to shell"?

983
00:39:41,647 --> 00:39:44,583
I didn't technically
break any rules.

984
00:39:44,616 --> 00:39:46,051
(sighs)

985
00:39:50,689 --> 00:39:52,123
You know what?

986
00:39:52,157 --> 00:39:53,692
Lucifer was right.

987
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:56,127
The swear jar, it's...
it's a dumb idea.

988
00:39:56,161 --> 00:39:58,630
Mommy gave you a bunch of rules

989
00:39:58,664 --> 00:40:00,966
without explaining things.

990
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:03,535
The real reason

991
00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:04,770
that we shouldn't swear

992
00:40:04,803 --> 00:40:07,906
is that bad words
make people feel bad.

993
00:40:07,939 --> 00:40:12,043
And I know you don't want
to make people feel bad, right?

994
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:14,179
'Cause the truth is
if you go looking for loopholes,

995
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:16,014
you'll always find them.

996
00:40:16,047 --> 00:40:19,451
And I can't force you
to do the right thing.

997
00:40:19,485 --> 00:40:22,153
You'll just have to
learn that on your own.

998
00:40:22,187 --> 00:40:25,691
So no more swear jar. Okay?

999
00:40:25,724 --> 00:40:29,528
So does that mean
I get my money back?

1000
00:40:29,561 --> 00:40:30,996
Nice try.

1001
00:40:36,234 --> 00:40:38,804
Would you like to come in?

1002
00:40:38,837 --> 00:40:40,706
You're not gonna pounce
on me again, are you?

1003
00:40:40,739 --> 00:40:43,074
Because that was
a smashing success last time.

1004
00:40:43,108 --> 00:40:44,810
Come in, scaredy-cat.

1005
00:40:44,843 --> 00:40:48,547
After today, I need wine stat.

1006
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,848
This whole "being good" thing?

1007
00:40:49,881 --> 00:40:51,983
Tougher than I thought.

1008
00:40:52,017 --> 00:40:53,719
It's a nice place you've got.

1009
00:40:53,752 --> 00:40:57,088
Though, uh, could stand
to nest a bit more.

1010
00:40:57,122 --> 00:41:01,092
I don't even remember
getting this place.

1011
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:03,662
I hope you like red.

1012
00:41:03,695 --> 00:41:06,632
I'm a rosé girl, myself.

1013
00:41:06,665 --> 00:41:08,667
Apparently while I was away,

1014
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,969
I bought 30 cases of Merlot.

1015
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:12,838
(chuckles) Yes.
Sorry about that.

1016
00:41:12,871 --> 00:41:13,772
Why would you be sorry?

1017
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:16,041
You're not responsible
for my lost time.

1018
00:41:16,074 --> 00:41:17,709
No.

1019
00:41:17,743 --> 00:41:19,778
Yet I can't help but feel...

1020
00:41:21,046 --> 00:41:22,581
(chuckles)

1021
00:41:22,614 --> 00:41:24,750
...somewhat accountable.

1022
00:41:24,783 --> 00:41:27,853
Is that why you're here?

1023
00:41:27,886 --> 00:41:29,588
Well, this strange,
inexplicable compulsion

1024
00:41:29,621 --> 00:41:31,156
to make sure you're okay?

1025
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:32,791
Very possibly.

1026
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:35,226
Dad be damned.

1027
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:40,532
You spent time with me when I...

1028
00:41:40,566 --> 00:41:43,168
wasn't me.

1029
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,272
What was I like?

1030
00:41:49,307 --> 00:41:51,843
Well, you were...

1031
00:41:51,877 --> 00:41:54,713
quite the handful, actually.

1032
00:41:54,746 --> 00:41:56,615
Intense.

1033
00:41:56,648 --> 00:41:57,983
Jealous.

1034
00:41:58,016 --> 00:41:59,885
Hair-trigger emotions.

1035
00:41:59,918 --> 00:42:03,288
Prone to making
cosmically epic mistakes.

1036
00:42:03,321 --> 00:42:05,824
(chuckles)

1037
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:08,326
But everything that you did--

1038
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:11,897
the other you did, I...

1039
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:15,066
I know that it came
from a place...

1040
00:42:17,736 --> 00:42:19,304
...of love.

1041
00:42:19,337 --> 00:42:21,840
* Ooh, are you happy

1042
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:25,611
I will miss her.

1043
00:42:25,644 --> 00:42:27,913
More than she'll ever know.

1044
00:42:27,946 --> 00:42:30,315
* I guess I'll be one of a lot

1045
00:42:30,348 --> 00:42:33,051
But that isn't you, is it?

1046
00:42:33,084 --> 00:42:34,920
No. No, it's not.
No.

1047
00:42:34,953 --> 00:42:36,855
Right. Well, then...

1048
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:39,591
I look forward

1049
00:42:39,625 --> 00:42:41,226
to getting to know the real you.

1050
00:42:41,259 --> 00:42:44,062
And I you.

1051
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:47,933
Welcome back,
Charlotte Richards.
