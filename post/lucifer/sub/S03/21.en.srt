00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,494
Cleaning staff found her when
they came in this morning.

185
00:07:31,538 --> 00:07:32,887
Any witnesses?

186
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,280
Uh, no. She's known
for taking rehearsals alone.

187
00:07:35,324 --> 00:07:36,804
Especially when
she's two days away

188
00:07:36,847 --> 00:07:38,196
from a big premiere
like Giselle.

189
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,198
Hmm. Hey, Ella.

190
00:07:40,242 --> 00:07:41,591
Any idea of the time of death?

191
00:07:41,635 --> 00:07:45,247
Looks like she was killed
roughly ten hours ago.

192
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,727
LUCIFER:
Oh, what a coincidence.

193
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:47,945
She's been dead almost as long

194
00:07:47,989 --> 00:07:49,381
as your dreadful relationship
to Pierce.

195
00:07:49,425 --> 00:07:51,079
[quietly]:
They broke up?

196
00:07:51,122 --> 00:07:52,515
[quietly]:
Actually, he broke up with her.

197
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:54,735
DAN: Okay.What about cause of death?

198
00:07:54,778 --> 00:07:55,866
ELLA:
Right.

199
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,477
Well, according to

200
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,261
the ligature marks
on her throat,

201
00:07:59,304 --> 00:08:01,176
she was strangled...

202
00:08:01,219 --> 00:08:04,266
using the ties from this.

203
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:05,746
She was killed
with her own shoe?

204
00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:07,399
Not her shoe.
Different size.

205
00:08:07,443 --> 00:08:08,836
But why leave
the murder weapon behind?

206
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,446
Maybe whoever did this
freaked out and ran?

207
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,447
We've seen it before.

208
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,883
Oh, yes, we have,

209
00:08:12,927 --> 00:08:15,407
from the lowest form of scum
on earth... like Pierce.

210
00:08:16,321 --> 00:08:17,932
Well, come on.

211
00:08:17,975 --> 00:08:19,586
I mean, we're all thinking it,
aren't we?

212
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:22,676
Anyway, time to get the slipper
back to the lab.

213
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:26,506
Any other questions,
here's my prelim.

214
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,120
DAN: Uh... I'm gonna
join her, 'cause...

215
00:08:32,163 --> 00:08:33,295
because this is awkward.

216
00:08:33,338 --> 00:08:35,906
Oh, and, uh,
personally,

217
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,517
I'm with you, buddy.

218
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,518
Screw that guy.

219
00:08:39,954 --> 00:08:41,129
[chuckles]So, we're searching

220
00:08:41,172 --> 00:08:42,478
for a murderous
Cinderella.

221
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,958
Yes, someone timelessly evil.

222
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:45,437
Almost like a cretinous
lieutenant named...

223
00:08:45,481 --> 00:08:46,613
Enough, Lucifer.

224
00:08:46,656 --> 00:08:47,918
This murder has
nothing to do with Pierce.

225
00:08:47,962 --> 00:08:49,572
Well, not literally, perhaps...

226
00:08:49,616 --> 00:08:51,139
I know you want me
to hate him.

227
00:08:51,182 --> 00:08:52,967
To tell you he's terrible.

228
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,578
But the truth is,
our relationship

229
00:08:55,622 --> 00:08:57,275
is none of your business.

230
00:08:57,319 --> 00:08:59,147
Former relationship, you mean?Yes.

231
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,148
Yes.
No, no...

232
00:09:00,191 --> 00:09:01,802
No?I-I don't, I don't know.

233
00:09:01,845 --> 00:09:04,805
Point being,
you need to back off.

234
00:09:04,848 --> 00:09:06,154
Whether I decide

235
00:09:06,197 --> 00:09:09,157
to take Pierce back or not,
it just,

236
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,550
it has nothing to do with you.

237
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:20,951
Or maybe it still does.

238
00:09:23,214 --> 00:09:25,216
♪

239
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,661
Great news!

240
00:09:34,704 --> 00:09:36,401
The detective still
makes me bleed.

241
00:09:36,445 --> 00:09:37,707
Which means there's hope.

242
00:09:37,751 --> 00:09:39,927
LINDA:
Uh, hope for...

243
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,972
Well, for the detective,
of course!

244
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:43,974
Hope that she hasn't
fully succumbed

245
00:09:44,018 --> 00:09:46,629
to that intolerable knob,
Pierce.

246
00:09:46,673 --> 00:09:47,630
Even if he has
lost his mark.

247
00:09:47,674 --> 00:09:49,197
Pierce lost his what now?

248
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,416
Allow me to catch you up.

249
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:55,899
So, the lieutenant has
a ridiculous theory

250
00:09:55,943 --> 00:09:57,858
that, shockingly,
may hold water.

251
00:09:57,901 --> 00:09:59,686
He believes that
the detective's affections

252
00:09:59,729 --> 00:10:00,861
are what make me vulnerable.

253
00:10:00,904 --> 00:10:02,863
And now that
she cares for him--

254
00:10:02,906 --> 00:10:05,213
well, long story short, old ham
hands isn't cursed anymore.

255
00:10:05,256 --> 00:10:06,257
He's mortal.

256
00:10:07,998 --> 00:10:09,043
So,

257
00:10:09,086 --> 00:10:10,871
your vulnerability is proof

258
00:10:10,914 --> 00:10:12,568
that Chloe cared for you...

259
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,657
but now she
cares for Pierce,

260
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:16,877
so now he'svulnerable, too.Close.

261
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,530
She cares for Pierce and me.

262
00:10:18,574 --> 00:10:21,577
As proven by my bleeding.

263
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,972
Yet, for some
inexplicable reason,

264
00:10:25,015 --> 00:10:27,409
she's on the fence
between the two of us.

265
00:10:27,452 --> 00:10:28,540
And how does that make you feel?

266
00:10:28,584 --> 00:10:31,674
Well, it makes me feel...

267
00:10:31,718 --> 00:10:32,936
like I...

268
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,246
...like I need
to tip the scales in my favor.

269
00:10:38,289 --> 00:10:39,682
Show her

270
00:10:39,726 --> 00:10:41,553
which side
the grass is greener on.

271
00:10:41,597 --> 00:10:44,382
And why do you want
to tip Chloe to your side?

272
00:10:44,426 --> 00:10:45,906
Because, as her partner,

273
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:48,735
it's my duty to save her
from making a terrible mistake.

274
00:10:48,778 --> 00:10:50,040
Uh-huh.

275
00:10:50,084 --> 00:10:51,302
Pierce has clearly blinded her

276
00:10:51,346 --> 00:10:52,652
with his charming oaf routine.

277
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:54,131
So I need to open her eyes.

278
00:10:54,175 --> 00:10:57,569
Show her that I'm better
than him in every possible way.

279
00:10:57,613 --> 00:10:59,702
And what if
Chloe does choose you?

280
00:10:59,746 --> 00:11:02,792
Well, then, things can finally
go back to the way they were,

281
00:11:02,836 --> 00:11:06,448
before Pierce, obviously.
[laughs]

282
00:11:06,491 --> 00:11:09,756
Uh...[door opens, closes]

283
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:12,454
Why do I feel like I should've
stopped him this time?

284
00:11:12,497 --> 00:11:13,716
MAZE:
What the hell is this?

285
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,284
PIERCE: It's pretty
self-explanatory.

286
00:11:16,327 --> 00:11:18,112
The plan is off.
Why?

287
00:11:18,155 --> 00:11:20,636
We were so close to getting
happily-sexed Decker

288
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,072
to fall for you.

289
00:11:22,116 --> 00:11:25,380
Yeah, and I messed it up, okay?
I broke up with her.

290
00:11:25,423 --> 00:11:28,078
You broke up with her?

291
00:11:29,427 --> 00:11:30,820
What happened to getting rid
of your mark?

292
00:11:30,864 --> 00:11:32,300
Doesn't matter.

293
00:11:32,343 --> 00:11:35,042
I'm done with grand plans
and manipulations.

294
00:11:35,085 --> 00:11:37,827
I don't want
to use Chloe anymore.

295
00:11:37,871 --> 00:11:39,655
What about
what I want?

296
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,744
Because if we don't
get Chloe to love you,

297
00:11:41,788 --> 00:11:43,311
then we can't
lift your curse.

298
00:11:43,354 --> 00:11:45,748
And if we can't
lift your curse,

299
00:11:45,792 --> 00:11:48,577
then I can't kill you
and hang it on Lucifer.

300
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,666
Framing Lucifer
for murder

301
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,973
is the only way to blow up
his life on Earth.

302
00:11:53,016 --> 00:11:54,322
Keep your voice down.

303
00:11:54,365 --> 00:11:55,715
What don't you get?

304
00:11:55,758 --> 00:11:57,281
My side of the plan
doesn't work without yours.

305
00:11:57,325 --> 00:11:58,935
And I need this

306
00:11:58,979 --> 00:12:00,632
to get back to Hell.

307
00:12:00,676 --> 00:12:04,288
I'm sorry.
Like I said, the plan's off.

308
00:12:10,381 --> 00:12:13,428
Says you.

309
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:17,301
Detective.

310
00:12:17,345 --> 00:12:18,694
Pardon my tardiness,

311
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,522
but I come bearing gifts.

312
00:12:20,565 --> 00:12:22,350
What is this?

313
00:12:22,393 --> 00:12:24,700
Well, I know how you like
your seasonal beverages,

314
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,789
so I got you a
"Luck o' the Irish" Latte

315
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,965
and-- oh!
To be sure, to be sure,

316
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:30,097
little something extra.

317
00:12:34,057 --> 00:12:36,190
Oh, y-you got me a lemon bar.

318
00:12:36,233 --> 00:12:37,931
Mm, well, they're your
favorites, aren't they?

319
00:12:37,974 --> 00:12:39,671
Mm...Look, Detective,

320
00:12:39,715 --> 00:12:42,196
I know that you're going through
a difficult time right now,

321
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:43,371
and what you need

322
00:12:43,414 --> 00:12:44,459
is someone who knows you.

323
00:12:44,502 --> 00:12:46,200
I know. It's just...

324
00:12:46,243 --> 00:12:48,028
Um...
It's just what?

325
00:12:48,071 --> 00:12:50,160
Ooh, lemon bars.
My favorite. Mmm.

326
00:12:50,204 --> 00:12:53,033
Oh, man, these are amazing.
Who made 'em?

327
00:12:53,076 --> 00:12:54,730
Uh, Pierce did.

328
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,732
Would you believe
that hunk bakes?

329
00:12:56,776 --> 00:13:00,214
On second thought,
who needs the empty calories?

330
00:13:00,257 --> 00:13:01,215
Hmm.

331
00:13:01,258 --> 00:13:04,522
Hmm, looks like someone

332
00:13:04,566 --> 00:13:06,568
is trying to crawl their way
out of the doghouse.

333
00:13:06,611 --> 00:13:07,438
Mm-hmm

334
00:13:07,482 --> 00:13:09,049
Is it working?Yes, is it?

335
00:13:09,092 --> 00:13:10,877
Let's just focus on the case.

336
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,139
Ella, what do you have?

337
00:13:12,182 --> 00:13:13,836
Uh, so I got a lead
off the murder weapon.

338
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,405
No match on the DNA, but I did
find a signature of sorts.

339
00:13:17,448 --> 00:13:19,537
The ballet shoe
had traces

340
00:13:19,581 --> 00:13:22,366
of olive oil,
Evian and beeswax.

341
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,064
So our killer's a bumblebee
with expensive taste?

342
00:13:24,107 --> 00:13:25,239
CHLOE:
Or a ballerina.

343
00:13:25,282 --> 00:13:27,589
Dancers all have
their own unique way

344
00:13:27,632 --> 00:13:29,330
of prepping
their shoes.

345
00:13:29,373 --> 00:13:30,592
And, according
to her social media,

346
00:13:30,635 --> 00:13:31,898
guess who uses
those exact ingredients?

347
00:13:31,941 --> 00:13:33,421
Reina's former
understudy

348
00:13:33,464 --> 00:13:37,686
and L.A. West Ballet's
new prima ballerina,

349
00:13:37,729 --> 00:13:39,688
Amber Fontaine.

350
00:13:39,731 --> 00:13:42,909
So either she took out
her competition

351
00:13:42,952 --> 00:13:44,867
or the killer somehow
got one of her shoes?

352
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:47,914
No, no, no, definitely looks
like a Black Swan to me.

353
00:13:47,957 --> 00:13:52,440
GWENDOLYN: And bras and up.
Ladies, arms out...

354
00:13:52,483 --> 00:13:54,094
CHLOE:
Sorry to interrupt.

355
00:13:54,137 --> 00:13:55,878
We'd like to speak

356
00:13:55,922 --> 00:13:57,445
with Amber Fontaine.For what?

357
00:13:57,488 --> 00:13:59,273
We're extremely busy here.

358
00:13:59,316 --> 00:14:00,709
Yes, us, too.

359
00:14:00,752 --> 00:14:02,754
Solving the crime of
a brutally murdered ballerina.

360
00:14:02,798 --> 00:14:04,104
But Amber didn't have anything
to do with that.

361
00:14:04,147 --> 00:14:06,584
[scoffs]And we only
got two days

362
00:14:06,628 --> 00:14:09,065
to get this show
up and running.Easy, easy, Gwen.

363
00:14:09,109 --> 00:14:10,545
They're just
doing their jobs.

364
00:14:10,588 --> 00:14:12,242
I'm sorry.

365
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:14,636
We're just all pretty
emotional right now.

366
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:17,030
Yes, clearly some
more than others.

367
00:14:17,073 --> 00:14:18,901
CHLOE: We know it
was your shoe

368
00:14:18,945 --> 00:14:20,642
that was used to strangle Reina.

369
00:14:20,685 --> 00:14:23,036
That's crazy.

370
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:25,081
The killer must've stolen them
out of my locker.

371
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:28,128
I mean, Reina's locker.

372
00:14:28,171 --> 00:14:30,913
Look, respect for going
full Tonya Harding,

373
00:14:30,957 --> 00:14:32,393
but if you're
gonna kill someone,

374
00:14:32,436 --> 00:14:33,916
you should get your story
straight first.

375
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,789
No, Reina's locker was mine
for, like, a week

376
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:40,662
when she left the company
for her new gig.

377
00:14:40,705 --> 00:14:42,664
But when she came back,
I had to return it.

378
00:14:42,707 --> 00:14:44,492
I-I must've left
my pointe shoes in there.

379
00:14:44,535 --> 00:14:45,797
Where were you
last night?

380
00:14:45,841 --> 00:14:47,103
Home.

381
00:14:47,147 --> 00:14:49,105
Sleeping like a baby.
You can ask my roommate.

382
00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:51,673
Now that Reina's dead,

383
00:14:51,716 --> 00:14:53,066
I'm back to being tied in knots.

384
00:14:53,109 --> 00:14:54,806
Yes, murder can do that.

385
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,678
No, as much as I
thought that I wanted

386
00:14:56,721 --> 00:15:01,161
her spot, to be able to dance
with a legend like Miguel,

387
00:15:01,204 --> 00:15:03,337
I-I wasn't ready.

388
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,339
I was happy to keep
learning from Reina.

389
00:15:05,382 --> 00:15:08,995
I thought it was
our gain and their loss.

390
00:15:09,038 --> 00:15:10,692
Whose loss exactly?

391
00:15:10,735 --> 00:15:12,824
You know, America's Next
Prima Ballerina.

392
00:15:14,391 --> 00:15:16,828
The TV show Reina
was gonna host.

393
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:21,921
You know, I'm inclined
to believe our young ingenue.

394
00:15:21,964 --> 00:15:23,792
If there's nothing she and
Reina were competing for,

395
00:15:23,835 --> 00:15:25,881
it makes her motive
far less compelling.

396
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,752
Yeah, we need to look
into this TV show,

397
00:15:27,796 --> 00:15:29,189
see why she
turned it down.

398
00:15:29,232 --> 00:15:31,278
Well, it certainly wouldn't
be art over commerce.

399
00:15:31,321 --> 00:15:33,889
No one has that
kind of passion...

400
00:15:36,413 --> 00:15:38,372
Are those from...

401
00:15:38,415 --> 00:15:41,157
Marcus. Yeah.

402
00:15:41,201 --> 00:15:43,072
Bastard. [elevator bell dings]

403
00:15:45,248 --> 00:15:47,816
Luci, what is so urgent?
Why'd you call me here?

404
00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:49,905
Because enough is enough.
It's time.

405
00:15:51,254 --> 00:15:53,039
We need to get rid of Pierce.

406
00:15:58,522 --> 00:16:00,046
What exactly do you mean by

407
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:01,047
"get rid of Pierce"?

408
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,049
Well, what do you think I mean?

409
00:16:03,092 --> 00:16:05,007
Yeah, we're not gonna
kill him, Luci.

410
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:07,575
I know, angels
can't kill humans,

411
00:16:07,618 --> 00:16:08,924
yadda yadda yadda.

412
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,708
Spare me the lecture.
Besides, killing Pierce

413
00:16:10,752 --> 00:16:12,406
isn't the answer anyway

414
00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:14,147
because, inexplicable
as it is,

415
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,887
the detective actually
cares for the man,

416
00:16:15,931 --> 00:16:17,411
and breaking her heart
isn't the goal.

417
00:16:17,454 --> 00:16:20,109
I got to admit, I'm a little
fuzzy on that one myself.

418
00:16:20,153 --> 00:16:21,502
What is the goal?

419
00:16:21,545 --> 00:16:24,374
For the detective to realize
she needs to pick me

420
00:16:24,418 --> 00:16:27,290
over that blithering clod,
Pierce, which...

421
00:16:27,334 --> 00:16:28,944
gah, shouldn't even
be an issue, but...

422
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,078
I'm in.
You are?

423
00:16:32,121 --> 00:16:35,690
You are my brother and my test.

424
00:16:35,733 --> 00:16:37,344
Whatever needs to be done.

425
00:16:37,387 --> 00:16:39,737
Well, I have to admit,

426
00:16:39,781 --> 00:16:42,305
I didn't expect that
to be quite so easy,

427
00:16:42,349 --> 00:16:44,655
but I'm not one to look
a gift-angel in the mouth,

428
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:45,787
I'll take it.

429
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,615
So what's the plan?

430
00:16:47,658 --> 00:16:49,225
We need to make
the detective realize

431
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:51,097
that Pierce isn't the man
she thinks he is.

432
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,708
We need to prove to her

433
00:16:53,751 --> 00:16:56,754
that he is a two-faced,
loathsome biblical liar.

434
00:16:57,842 --> 00:16:59,801
I mean, how hard can that be?

435
00:16:59,844 --> 00:17:03,065
He is the man behind the whole
Sinnerman thing, after all.

436
00:17:03,109 --> 00:17:06,982
Um... what?

437
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,463
Oh, I'm sorry.
Didn't I tell you?

438
00:17:09,506 --> 00:17:12,988
Fun fact: Pierce equals
criminal mastermind.

439
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,772
Anyway...

440
00:17:14,816 --> 00:17:17,819
You run with that, and I'll
keep working on the detective.

441
00:17:17,862 --> 00:17:20,300
GRIZZLED MAN:
Read my lips:

442
00:17:20,343 --> 00:17:23,085
Dance is pain.

443
00:17:23,129 --> 00:17:25,653
You want to feel sorry
for yourselves?

444
00:17:25,696 --> 00:17:28,177
Then go back to Kansas
or wherever you're from.

445
00:17:28,221 --> 00:17:30,310
ELLA:
That is Myles Druker.

446
00:17:30,353 --> 00:17:33,791
Only one of the most amazing
choreographers in the world.

447
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:35,358
Choreographer
with a bum leg?

448
00:17:35,402 --> 00:17:38,013
Is this one of those, "those
who can't, teach" scenarios?

449
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:41,408
He was a dancer who lost his leg
in a car crash.

450
00:17:41,451 --> 00:17:42,713
Oh.

451
00:17:42,757 --> 00:17:44,585
But he never believed
in playing the victim.

452
00:17:44,628 --> 00:17:46,021
Instead,

453
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,632
he turned his tragedy
into an inspirational story

454
00:17:48,676 --> 00:17:50,112
for all of us to follow.

455
00:17:50,156 --> 00:17:53,985
He's also the creator of America's Next Prima Ballerina,

456
00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:55,552
the show that Reina
was gonna host,

457
00:17:55,596 --> 00:17:57,859
until she reneged on her deal
and it cost him a fortune.

458
00:17:57,902 --> 00:17:59,252
Right. Well, I don't see why

459
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,862
he wouldn't take
such a loss in stride.

460
00:18:00,905 --> 00:18:03,821
[laughs] You see
what I did there?Mm-hmm.

461
00:18:03,865 --> 00:18:05,649
In stride?

462
00:18:05,693 --> 00:18:07,173
You must be aware
that Reina Markova

463
00:18:07,216 --> 00:18:08,478
was killed last night.

464
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:12,700
Yeah, I heard. Big whoop.

465
00:18:12,743 --> 00:18:15,268
[chuckles] Well, for a potential
cold-blooded killer,

466
00:18:15,311 --> 00:18:17,183
you're being quite... obvious.

467
00:18:17,226 --> 00:18:20,142
I mean, I just don't think Reina
was much of a professional.

468
00:18:20,186 --> 00:18:21,317
Then why'd you hire her?

469
00:18:21,361 --> 00:18:23,972
Let's just say I was...
pressured

470
00:18:24,015 --> 00:18:25,278
into our collaboration.

471
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:27,628
By whom?

472
00:18:27,671 --> 00:18:30,805
By none of your business.

473
00:18:30,848 --> 00:18:32,459
Look, I'm a very busy man,

474
00:18:32,502 --> 00:18:34,635
so unless you're gonna charge me
with anything, we're done here.

475
00:18:34,678 --> 00:18:35,810
LUCIFER:
Well, actually, no.

476
00:18:35,853 --> 00:18:37,986
I just have
one more question.

477
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:39,292
Uh, take note,
Detective.

478
00:18:39,335 --> 00:18:40,945
Here's something I can do
that other people,

479
00:18:40,989 --> 00:18:42,599
rhymes with Shmierce, cannot.

480
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,732
Tell me,

481
00:18:44,775 --> 00:18:48,039
what is it that you
truly desire?

482
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:51,913
I wish...
Yeah.

483
00:18:51,956 --> 00:18:54,089
...that car crash
never happened.

484
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,831
Why? 'Cause it crushed your leg?

485
00:18:56,874 --> 00:18:59,399
No.

486
00:18:59,442 --> 00:19:01,183
Because it didn't crush my leg.

487
00:19:01,227 --> 00:19:02,228
Oh!

488
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,752
Right, well.

489
00:19:04,795 --> 00:19:06,536
Care to explain?

490
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,543
Everyone believes the accident
ruined my career.

491
00:19:13,587 --> 00:19:17,112
Well, the truth is, it made it.

492
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,114
I built my brand
on the notion

493
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,116
that I could
overcome anything.

494
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,381
I walk around with
a prosthetic every day

495
00:19:25,425 --> 00:19:27,905
covering my real leg.

496
00:19:27,949 --> 00:19:29,690
[thump]

497
00:19:29,733 --> 00:19:30,952
Polypropylene.

498
00:19:30,995 --> 00:19:33,346
Oh. So is that why
Reina left the show?

499
00:19:33,389 --> 00:19:34,869
She found out you were a fraud?

500
00:19:34,912 --> 00:19:38,699
No, she quit because I accused
her of blackmailing me.

501
00:19:38,742 --> 00:19:41,702
I was sent an e-mail

502
00:19:41,745 --> 00:19:44,313
with a video that exposed me--

503
00:19:44,357 --> 00:19:45,880
you know,
with two working legs--

504
00:19:45,923 --> 00:19:48,230
said that if I gave Reina a job,
the video would disappear.

505
00:19:48,274 --> 00:19:49,362
So I did.

506
00:19:49,405 --> 00:19:50,798
But she didn't send it?

507
00:19:50,841 --> 00:19:52,103
Apparently not,

508
00:19:52,147 --> 00:19:53,670
even though it was sent
from her e-mail address,

509
00:19:53,714 --> 00:19:55,368
because when I confronted her,
she went ballistic.

510
00:19:55,411 --> 00:19:57,718
Said that she didn't need any
handouts and quit right there.

511
00:19:57,761 --> 00:20:01,156
But if she didn't blackmail you,
then who did?

512
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,897
Beats me.

513
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:06,466
Right. Well, you better not
be pulling our legs.

515
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,818

What are you doing here,
Charlotte?

518
00:20:17,346 --> 00:20:18,782
Isn't it obvious?

519
00:20:20,306 --> 00:20:22,003
I'm a terrible person that's...

520
00:20:22,046 --> 00:20:24,179
that's led a terrible life,
so I'm... [laughs]

521
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,269
I'm preparing myself
for damnation.

522
00:20:27,313 --> 00:20:29,402
In a three-star hotel?

523
00:20:29,445 --> 00:20:30,751
It's what I deserve.

524
00:20:30,794 --> 00:20:32,970
Well, it's time to sober up.

525
00:20:33,014 --> 00:20:35,277
I need your help
with a legal matter.

526
00:20:35,321 --> 00:20:38,498
Don't you want to ask someone
less damned?

527
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:39,629
I don't think so.

528
00:20:39,673 --> 00:20:41,196
I need to find
a way to prove

529
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,155
that Lieutenant Pierce
is the criminal mastermind

530
00:20:44,199 --> 00:20:45,809
also known as
the Sinnerman.

531
00:20:45,853 --> 00:20:47,463
Say again?

532
00:20:47,507 --> 00:20:51,598
Lieutenant Pierce has been
leading a double life

533
00:20:51,641 --> 00:20:53,426
for quite some time now.

534
00:20:53,469 --> 00:20:54,775
