1
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:03,104
Previously, on Lucifer...
My dad screwed us both.

2
00:00:03,137 --> 00:00:05,139
But perhaps there's a way

3
00:00:05,173 --> 00:00:06,640
for us to screw him back.
How?

4
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:07,708
By killing you.

5
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:09,677
Amenadiel's nice.
If he were nice,

6
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,480
he wouldn't be sneaking around
behind my back with my friend,

7
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:13,481
and lying about it.

8
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:15,149
You know, don't you?

9
00:00:15,183 --> 00:00:16,484
You're the ones
who have been

10
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:18,819
lying to me about
this fling for weeks.

11
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,054
I'd like to try and help.

12
00:00:20,088 --> 00:00:21,555
You don't have to treat me.

13
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:23,357
I think I do.
For both of us.

14
00:00:23,391 --> 00:00:24,692
LUCIFER:
In my quest to help you die,

15
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:26,094
I've done some research.

16
00:00:26,127 --> 00:00:27,428
I've read every book,

17
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:28,629
I've analyzed every language.

18
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:30,398
LUCIFER:
I'm completely out of ideas.

19
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:31,499
We can't rewrite history.

20
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,634
Detective, you're a genius.

21
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:35,336
You've just given me my idea.

22
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:37,638
LUCIFER:
Once upon a time,

23
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:41,409
there were two brothers--
Kane and Abel.

24
00:00:41,442 --> 00:00:45,213
They fought, as brothers often
do, over everything.

25
00:00:45,246 --> 00:00:47,215
What's that supposed to be?
Are we shaking hands

26
00:00:47,248 --> 00:00:48,716
or holding spiders?

27
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:51,152
(chuckles)
That's you and your brother

28
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:53,387
pummeling each other
over a pet rock.

29
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:57,291
And here's you two scamps
tugging on both ends of a snake.

30
00:00:57,325 --> 00:00:58,492
That's not how it happened.

31
00:00:58,526 --> 00:01:00,728
Well, artistic license,
my friend.

32
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:04,165
The point is that you were
always at each other's throats.

33
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:06,300
Until...
(sniffs)

34
00:01:06,334 --> 00:01:08,669
...you fought to the death.

35
00:01:08,702 --> 00:01:11,405
You killed Abel

36
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,741
and became the world's

37
00:01:13,774 --> 00:01:14,608
first murderer.

38
00:01:14,642 --> 00:01:17,111
Now, the part where
my father marks you,

39
00:01:17,145 --> 00:01:19,413
cursing you to walk the earth
for eternity,

40
00:01:19,447 --> 00:01:21,182
it's tricky to draw.
Now, um,

41
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:23,251
I've heard this one before--
the ending sucks.

42
00:01:23,284 --> 00:01:24,885
My point exactly.

43
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,388
We all know how your story ends.

44
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:31,392
But what if we change
how it begins?

45
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:35,863
What if you never killed Abel?

46
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:38,766
What if we did...

47
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,234
this?

48
00:01:40,268 --> 00:01:41,435
Clean slate.

49
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:43,271
That's impossible.
How would we do that?

50
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:44,272
Oh, simple.

51
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:48,142
I shall fly down to Hell,

52
00:01:48,176 --> 00:01:51,445
pluck your brother's soul, and
drop it into a vacant body.

53
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,681
This would make Abel
technically alive,

54
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:56,850
and therefore not murdered,
and you innocent.

55
00:01:56,884 --> 00:02:00,221
Wait, back up.
My brother is in Hell?

56
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:02,290
Yes, of course.
In fact, he's our oldest tenant.

57
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:05,493
I knew it. Do you know how many
times I've tried to tell people

58
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:07,428
Abel is the asshat?
No one ever believes me.

59
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,230
Right, can we just focus
on my genius plan?

60
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:11,332
If we bring Abel
back to life,

61
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:13,367
that would erase your crime.

62
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:18,239
No crime, no mark,
no curse.

63
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:21,775
You'd be mortal
and can finally die.

64
00:02:23,411 --> 00:02:24,745
PIERCE:
This one's good.

65
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:27,781
Oh, this one's
even better.

66
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:29,717
Yeah, a bit past its
sell-by date, I'm afraid.

67
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,419
Wait till Abel
wakes up in this body.

68
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:32,453
I never thought
I'd say this,

69
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,322
but slow down, Lieutenant.

70
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:37,491
Time to lay down some
soul-dropping rules,

71
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:39,193
or what I think the rules are,
at least.

72
00:02:39,227 --> 00:02:40,594
You have done this
before, right?

73
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:44,698
Not exactly, but based
on a sample size of, uh,

74
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:46,700
one crooked cop
and one goddess,

75
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:49,837
I can only drop a soul into
someone who's recently died.

76
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:50,704
How recent?

77
00:02:50,738 --> 00:02:51,939
The instant after death.

78
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:53,407
So we need a fresh one.

79
00:02:53,441 --> 00:02:54,542
How are we gonna find that?

80
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:56,444
Hey, guys?

81
00:02:56,477 --> 00:02:58,346
There's been an explosion
at a high-rise downtown.

82
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,548
There's one dead at the scene,
one on the way to the ICU.

83
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:02,216
Oh, that's promising.

84
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,218
Excuse me?
PIERCE: He means
that's a promising chance

85
00:03:04,252 --> 00:03:05,619
to question the witness
at the hospital.

86
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:06,620
Mm. Yes,

87
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:09,290
where loads of people
are on the brink of death.

88
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:12,593
So you want to question
someone who's unconscious

89
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:14,628
and in critical condition?

90
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:16,764
The witness may recover,
have some intel.

91
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:18,432
Can't hurt to check.
Hmm.

92
00:03:18,466 --> 00:03:22,303
Okay, we'll work
the crime scene.

93
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:24,538
Lucifer, you coming?

94
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:26,974
Lucifer's coming with me
this time.

95
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:33,981
Shall we?

96
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:36,550
* Such a pretty face

97
00:03:36,584 --> 00:03:38,586
* Straight teeth

98
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:40,921
* Look baby, now you playing
in a different league... *

99
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,823
DAN: Bomb squad did
their threat report.

100
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:44,858
Ruled it as a homicide,
handed it off to us.

101
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:47,461
Looks like the bomb
came by messenger.

102
00:03:47,495 --> 00:03:49,897
And, uh, an assistant opened the
package, triggering the bomb.

103
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,533
Huh. Is that the messenger?

104
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,968
Yep. Rest in peace, dude.

105
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:57,805
We tried to track who sent it,
but they covered their tracks.

106
00:03:57,838 --> 00:03:59,006
One thing we do know

107
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,908
is that the assistant
wasn't the target.

108
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:02,142
Package was addressed
to her boss.

109
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:06,914
Producer Alexa Lee, she just
came in, she's pretty shook up.

110
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:08,882
All right.
Let's go talk to her.

111
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,585
Where were you
when the blast occurred?

112
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:12,786
At home.

113
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,054
My Tuesday
session with Paolo,

114
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,489
my Pilates trainer.

115
00:04:15,523 --> 00:04:17,558
You have any idea
who'd want to hurt you?

116
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,428
Any past enemies, grudges,
anything like that?

117
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:22,330
How much time you got?
(scoffs)

118
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:24,031
Come on, this is Hollywood.

119
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:26,367
I get way more hate
mail than fan mail.

120
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,637
Did any one threat
stand out at all?

121
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,639
Uh, my assistant will know.

122
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:32,906
Bree Garland.

123
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,409
She deals with all my mail
and...

124
00:04:35,443 --> 00:04:36,910
oh, my God,
did Bree open the box?

125
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,546
She's in the ICU.

126
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:39,947
But we haven't heard word yet.

127
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,582
Oh, no.

128
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:42,883
It should have been me.

129
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,818
Poor Bree.

130
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:46,019
LUCIFER:
Bree Garland?

131
00:04:46,053 --> 00:04:48,456
She won't do at all.
Why not?

132
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:50,023
Well, how much
do you hate your brother

133
00:04:50,057 --> 00:04:52,526
on a scale of one to ten?

134
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,962
One thousand, infinity plus one.

135
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:57,398
Right, well, if we pop Abel
into a body this young,

136
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:59,533
you could be stuck with him
for another 70 years.

137
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:01,001
That's a lot of quality time.

138
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:01,969
Copy, not her.

139
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:04,972
(sighs) No, what we need
is someone ancient,

140
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:06,640
someone at death's door.

141
00:05:06,674 --> 00:05:09,910
-(heart rate monitor flatlining)
-Someone...

142
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:17,418
(clears throat)

143
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:28,429
PIERCE:
"Do not resuscitate.

144
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:30,431
"97 years old,

145
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:31,565
no next of kin."

146
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:33,066
Perfect.

147
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,936
Yes, we'll put Abel
in this old coot. (giggles)

148
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:38,005
He gets a second
chance at life

149
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:39,640
and you get your chance
at death.

150
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,442
Let's do this.

151
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:42,743
Right.

152
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,782
Enjoy the show, Dad.

153
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:50,451
(wings whoosh)

154
00:05:55,623 --> 00:05:58,626
(heart rate monitor flatlining)

155
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:00,528
-(wind whooshes)
-(feet thud)

156
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:02,563
Right.

157
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:08,702
(heart rate monitor
beats rhythmically)

158
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:10,137
(sighs)

159
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,539
Any second now.

160
00:06:14,642 --> 00:06:17,611
Any second.

161
00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:19,046
You sure you did this right?

162
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,414
Well, I know I grabbed Abel
down below.

163
00:06:20,448 --> 00:06:22,750
PIERCE: Did you put him
in the right place?
LUCIFER: Probably.

164
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:23,717
PIERCE: What do you
mean, "probably"?

165
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:25,519
LUCIFER: Well, like
I said, I'm new to this.

166
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:26,687
But where else would
I have dropped him?

167
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,089
Did you screw this up?
I don't know.

168
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:30,924
I mean, it's not like
there's an instruction manual.

169
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:37,064
Lucifer.

170
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:38,499
Where did she go?

171
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:39,533
Hmm?

172
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:49,109
Oh.

173
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,845
Okay, I see
what's happened here.

174
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:54,848
It appears I may have misplaced
your brother's soul.

175
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:56,049
(chuckles)

176
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,150
But in my defense,
what were the chances

177
00:06:57,184 --> 00:07:00,854
of this young lady expiring
at the exact same time?

178
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:02,590
Tell me you didn't
put Abel in her body.

179
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:04,658
(sighs) So I make
one teeny mistake.

180
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:07,194
Yes, it appears that Abel is
running around as a young woman.

181
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:10,030
But the point is, we did it.

182
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:12,099
Abel's alive.

183
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:14,702
What matters is,
your curse is lifted

184
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:16,737
and you should no longer
have your mark.

185
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,472
So come on,
let's have a look.

186
00:07:18,506 --> 00:07:22,476
The mark is still there,
which means I'm still cursed.

187
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:25,045
We failed.

188
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:30,117
(sighs)

189
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,585
Bugger.

190
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:33,621
*

191
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:43,163
*

192
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:51,905
(scoffs)

193
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:53,641
He's a spry one.

194
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:55,008
Or she.

195
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:56,577
No sign of her anywhere.

196
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,845
I mean, him.

197
00:07:57,878 --> 00:07:59,079
This is head-spinning,
isn't it?

198
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:01,081
We need to find him.
Why?

199
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:02,783
You already figured
out a plan "B"?

200
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,852
Another way Abel can help
remove your curse? What is it?

201
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:06,854
I don't know, but whatever it
is, it has to involve Abel.

202
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:07,921
Right.

203
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:09,156
Time to call
the detective.

204
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:10,090
Yeah, that's a great idea.

205
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:12,192
"Hey, Decker.
We broke Abel out of Hell,

206
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:13,594
"dropped his soul
into the wrong body

207
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:15,195
"and lost him.
Now he's on the lam

208
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:16,530
"in the body of the victim
from your case.

209
00:08:16,564 --> 00:08:18,832
Also, I'm immortal."

210
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:20,634
There's no need to get snippy.

211
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:22,803
Fine, we'll do this on
our own under the radar.

212
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:23,904
Now, he's your brother.

213
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:25,138
Where do you think he'd go?

214
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,707
I don't know,
we're not exactly in touch.

215
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,741
It's been a few millenia.

216
00:08:27,775 --> 00:08:29,076
You tortured him in Hell.

217
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:30,911
You probably know him
better than I do.

218
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:32,245
(sighs)
Barely saw him, actually.

219
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,615
I was more of a big
picture kind of guy.

220
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:37,751
The good news is
I do know a demon or two.

221
00:08:37,785 --> 00:08:39,219
Come on.

222
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:41,121
CHLOE:
Who knew a producer

223
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:43,657
could have this many enemies?

224
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:46,594
Occupational hazard,
I guess.

225
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:48,061
Yikes, check this out.

226
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:49,262
Look at that.

227
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:51,331
Huh.

228
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,766
"You're going to die."

229
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,768
Hmm.
I do believe
we have a winner.

230
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:58,305
Hang on.

231
00:08:58,338 --> 00:08:59,973
Look at the Gs.

232
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:01,642
It's the same handwriting.

233
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:02,876
Sent a few weeks back.

234
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,144
They were upset

235
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:06,279
about one of Alexa's movies,
The Plunge.

236
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:08,782
"It's full of lies.

237
00:09:08,816 --> 00:09:11,885
If you want the real truth,
read The Z Prophecy."

238
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:12,886
What is that?

239
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,254
Wait, Alexa made The Plunge?

240
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,088
Have you seen it?

241
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:17,290
(chuckling):
Oh, man. A group of teens,

242
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:18,859
they have to travel
to the center of the Earth

243
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,227
to unclog
this blocked-up magma.

244
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,294
Oh, man, does it get intense.

245
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:23,363
Mm-hmm. Whoever
wrote this letter

246
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,767
wants people to read
The Z Prophecy.

247
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,235
Wonder what it is.

248
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:30,804
DAN: "Visionary, Liam Wade,"
author of The Z Prophecy

249
00:09:30,838 --> 00:09:33,874
and a whole bunch of other
conspiracy theories. Wow.

250
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,009
Seems pretty bonkers.
Check out his manifesto.

251
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:37,911
CHLOE:
Look.

252
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,783
It's the same handwriting
as the letters.

253
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:44,251
Okay, we need to talk to him

254
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:46,920
and find out exactly why
he was threatening Alexa.

255
00:09:46,954 --> 00:09:48,021
CHARLOTTE:
Crap.

256
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:50,190
Old socks.

257
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:51,659
Moldy leaves.

258
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:53,827
If it tastes so bad,
why drink it?

259
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:55,162
Well, I read that
five doses a day

260
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:57,230
helps supercharge
your memory.

261
00:09:57,264 --> 00:10:00,167
I've also tried...

262
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,035
meditation, sudoku,

263
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:03,236
a lot of broccoli,

264
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,839
but no recovered memories
so far.

265
00:10:05,873 --> 00:10:07,207
Just flatulence.

266
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,209
I was hoping
that you had some,

267
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:11,278
um, memory-jogging techniques.

268
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:13,313
Perhaps some mental exercises
I could do,

269
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,215
preferably, while I'm sleeping

270
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:17,284
because that's four hours a day

271
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:19,286
I don't need to waste
just sleeping. (chuckles)

272
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:22,222
You do realize you can't win
at therapy.

273
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:23,924
Oh, please,
I can win at anything.

274
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,325
Let's start there.

275
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:27,427
Your desire to win tells me

276
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,863
you have a strong need
for control.

277
00:10:29,897 --> 00:10:33,266
Could we focus
on finding my lost memories?

278
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,002
Because that's what
I'm paying you for.

279
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:36,870
Well, I think
we should slow down

280
00:10:36,904 --> 00:10:39,339
and focus on what
you do remember.

281
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:42,409
You say that you keep reliving
the same thing over and over.

282
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:43,944
Is it like,

283
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:49,249
say, an endless, horrible loop?

284
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:52,285
One you weren't even aware
you were trapped in?

285
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,826
I know this is scary.

286
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:01,962
But it's where we need to start.

287
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,831
In your Hell.

288
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:05,766
No, that's the last thing
I need.

289
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,801
And not what
I asked you for at all.

290
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:10,370
Okay, well, it's not really
about what you think you need.

291
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,906
Or ask for.

292
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,908
I know you're used
to being in charge,

293
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:16,844
but I'm the expert here.

294
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:19,479
You need to let me drive this.

295
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,482
Drive me crazy, so that you can
get me hooked on therapy,

296
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,952
and milk me for every cent.

297
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:26,119
No, thanks.

298
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,325
(exhales)

299
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:33,493
(Maze moans)

300
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,928
Oh, God, Abel.

301
00:11:34,962 --> 00:11:35,996
(chuckles)

302
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,798
You never forget your first.

303
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:39,399
So you'll help us
find him, then?

304
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:40,333
I'll tell you what I know

305
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,936
so you can do
your own grunt work for once.

306
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,238
Did you know
that Abel

307
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:47,374
was the first soul in Hell?

308
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:48,341
Mm, an infernal guinea pig,

309
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,044
so to speak.
MAZE:
We all learned to torture

310
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:52,312
by torturing him.

311
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:53,246
What'd you do to him?

312
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,817
(inhales) Well,
Abel would be out partying,

313
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,352
and then, you'd show up.

314
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,420
(chuckles)

315
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,055
I don't walk like that.

316
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:03,423
Yeah, you do.
Yes, you do.

317
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:04,925
Why was I even there?

318
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,160
You were the star
of Abel's Hell loop.

319
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:12,132
No matter what he did, you'd
always show up, and kill him.

320
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:14,902
Over and over.

321
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:16,436
I was his torturer?

322
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:17,905
LUCIFER: Whilst this
is all very illuminating,

323
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:20,507
Maze, how do we find Abel?

324
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,308
(sighs)
Keep an ear out

325
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:22,810
for someone babbling
in Sumerian?

326
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:24,411
(laughing):
Oh, no, no.

327
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:26,346
He speaks in English.

328
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:27,347
And all the romance languages.

329
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,316
(scoffs)
Arabic, Mandarin.

330
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,885
I mean, he's a little dated,
and his Hindi needs work.

331
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:32,886
Wait, what?

332
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,287
Me and the other demons

333
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:37,024
would get bored,
so we'd switch up the Hell loop.

334
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:38,792
Okay? It would always be you
killing him,

335
00:12:38,826 --> 00:12:41,929
but at different times,
different places.

336
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:43,430
He was a fast learner.

337
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:45,999
So, what you're saying
is Hell made him multilingual

338
00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:47,300
and completely adaptable?

339
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:49,402
And we put him in the body
of a young woman.

340
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,438
(groans)

341
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:53,073
Smooth move, boys.

342
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:56,443
Hold on. If Abel's Hell
was constantly changing,

343
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:59,112
then this may just feel
like another Hell loop to him.

344
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:01,548
He may have no idea
he's actually alive again.

345
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:04,084
Do you remember
where he would start his loop?

346
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,452
Yes.
Hmm.

347
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:08,121
Do you know
who he reminds me of?

348
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:09,356
(stomps foot)

349
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:12,492
(scoffs)

350
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,828
Total poon hound.

351
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:16,529
You want to know
where Abel is...

352
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:19,499
...ask yourself.

353
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:20,968
Where would

354
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:23,370
caveman Lucifer go?

355
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:28,541
Fancy a walk?

356
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:33,413
*

357
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:39,419
* Yeah, I don't believe
in superstition *

358
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:42,055
* When you pull me in
I get a premonition... *

359
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:43,390
(engine revving)

360
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:44,824
(tires screeching)

361
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:50,630
Ladies, ladies.

362
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,066
Let's be fruitful,
and multiply, huh?

363
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,870
Allow me to bless you
with my seed.

364
00:13:56,904 --> 00:13:57,871
(chuckles)

365
00:13:57,905 --> 00:14:00,140
*

366
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:05,612
DAN: Would it kill this nutjob
to put in a driveway?

367
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:06,880
(sighs)

368
00:14:06,914 --> 00:14:08,115
Right, Chloe?

369
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:09,549
Huh?

370
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:10,483
Chloe.

371
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,285
What? Sorry, sorry.

372
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:13,186
I'm distracted.

373
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,421
It's just...
Yeah.

374
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:16,089
Pierce, taking Lucifer.

375
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:20,093
I'm worried that it's something
I did or said or both.

376
00:14:20,127 --> 00:14:21,228
Why?

377
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:22,963
What did you do or say?

378
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:24,297
Well...

379
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:25,565
uh, you know what? Never mind.

380
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:28,301
It's not Pierce,
i-it's Lucifer.

381
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:31,238
When he started here,
no one wanted to work with him.

382
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:33,974
And I spent all this time
training him, and...

383
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:36,109
now that he's somewhat
of a decent partner,

384
00:14:36,143 --> 00:14:38,245
Pierce just swoops in
and grabs him?

385
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:40,547
Lucifer doesn't even blink?

386
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,481
It's not cool.

387
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:42,549
Right.

388
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:44,584
Possessive much?

389
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:46,519
Come on,
I'm just giving you a hard time.

390
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:47,921
So he's working with Pierce.

391
00:14:47,955 --> 00:14:49,923
Lucifer's still
your partner.

392
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:51,925
What?

393
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:53,560
What, do I got something
on my face?

394
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:55,562
Oh, God, is there a spider?

395
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:57,264
Is it still there?

396
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:59,599
It's not a spider.

397
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,368
It's a sniper.

398
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:03,570
What?

399
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,377
Mr. Wade?

400
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,179
Please put down the weapon.

401
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:13,446
LIAM (over speaker):
This is private property.

402
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,483
Leave now.

403
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:19,452
Did you send this note

404
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:21,488
to Alexa Lee?

405
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,539
You read my message.

406
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:43,276
People are finally
starting to listen.

407
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,145
DAN: Mr. Wade,
um, we're here

408
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:48,015
because of a recent attempt
on Alexa's life.

409
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:51,751
Wait, why do you think
I would want to hurt Alexa?

410
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:55,522
Well, for starters, in the note,
you said that she was gonna die.

411
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:57,657
Yeah. Because she is.

412
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,092
She's gonna die.

413
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:00,527
I'm gonna die.

414
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,230
We're all gonna die
if we don't act now.

415
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:05,565
I wasn't threatening Alexa.

416
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:08,468
I wrote her a wake-up call.
About what?

417
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:10,537
Well, I'm glad you asked, ma'am.

418
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,139
You see,

419
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:15,442
our planet's magma flows
are blocked.

420
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:18,411
If that flow isn't
released, soon...

421
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:19,546
(exhales)

422
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:23,350
...big, molten apocalypse.

423
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:24,484
DAN:
Right.

424
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:26,286
I saw the movie.

425
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:29,289
And now you don't believe me,
and that is the problem.

426
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:32,092
The Plunge made the
prophecy into a joke.

427
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:35,362
Her crappy movie made a mockery

428
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:38,565
out of a very,
very serious issue.

429
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:40,400
I don't know, man,
I kind of dug The Plunge.

430
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:41,468
(sighs)

431
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,470
Seriously?

432
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,306
A jock, a nerd and a princess
save the planet?

433
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:47,474
I mean, come on.

434
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:48,608
It was fun.

435
00:16:50,077 --> 00:16:51,478
(exhales)

436
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,313
Wow.
(clears throat)

437
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:56,049
Look. I hated Alexa's movie.

438
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:59,152
Okay? But I would
never hurt her.

439
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:02,322
I-I actually kind of owe her.

440
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:05,592
Because guess who has 196 more
Twitter followers

441
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,327
since The Plunge premiered?

442
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,197
Okay, if you didn't
attack her, then who did?

443
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:13,133
Alexa had a lot of enemies.

444
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,602
Big Agro, Big Frac.

445
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:16,569
The Bolivians.

446
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:18,605
The carnies.

447
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:19,672
Carnies?

448
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:21,741
Okay, we're gonna need

449
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,143
to search your property.

450
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:24,411
Extensively.

451
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:28,215
* Hmm, mm

452
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:30,283
* You bring out
the devil in me... *

453
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:33,620
ABEL:
Mm.

454
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:35,588
Look at the bosoms on that one.

455
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,659
This is the land
of milk and honey.

456
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:42,562
Hello, Abel.

457
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:47,434
I've been watching you, Abel.

458
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:49,602
I do not want to lay with you.

459
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:51,238
Or any other man.

460
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:52,439
It's not my thing.

461
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:54,241
Listen, I'm not hitting on you.

462
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:55,608
You're a pawn.

463
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:58,578
Brought here by forces
that you don't understand.

464
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:00,480
Now, I'm here to take you
back to where you belong.

465
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:03,550
Okay. Does "no"
not mean "no" anymore?

466
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,718
I want one of these fine maidens

467
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,421
to warm my
bed, not you.

468
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:10,590
Or any of the men
who've been eyeing me

469
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:12,492
like I'm some big hunk of...
Abel.

470
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:14,561
Have you seen
yourself lately?

471
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:15,595
Oh.

472
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:19,499
Are those bosoms mine?

473
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:22,269
So that's why none
of those menfolk

474
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:23,536
heard a word I said.

475
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,406
Doesn't all this feel familiar?

476
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,809
Don't you sense
what's about to happen?

477
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,411
Yes.

478
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:35,215
Every time I seek out revelry,
my brother arrives.

479
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:36,349
And what
does he do?

480
00:18:36,383 --> 00:18:38,785
He...

481
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:39,686
He kills me.

482
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:42,155
Over and over.

483
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:45,825
And there's nothing
I can do to avoid it.

484
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:47,694
I've tried everything.

485
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:52,299
Fighting him, running from him,
all in vain.

486
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:53,733
I'm trapped.

487
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:56,503
I can never escape.

488
00:18:57,537 --> 00:18:58,705
You're right, Abel.

489
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:01,174
You can't fight him.

490
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,410
But I may have a way
out of this for you.

491
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:12,652
You want me to kill myself?

492
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:14,554
Well, I've never tried
that before.

493
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:19,192
How many more strip clubs
are we going to search?

494
00:19:19,226 --> 00:19:20,693
Why, as many as it takes.

495
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:22,795
What would I and
therefore Abel do next?

496
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,397
Keep up the fun, obviously.

497
00:19:24,431 --> 00:19:25,865
Well, we just spent
the last half hour

498
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,634
wandering past billboards
of women's lingerie.

499
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:28,835
And your problem is?

500
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:30,337
"Problems," plural.

501
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,571
One: no sign of Abel,

502
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:34,574
two: we have no idea what we're
gonna do even if we find him.

503
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,476
Well, speak for yourself,
Negative Nelly, 'cause I think

504
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:37,877
I've worked out exactly
what we need to do.

505
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,579
Wait, you have?
Yes.

506
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:41,348
Well, Dad's an old school kind
of guy, right?

507
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:42,615
Eye for an eye, and all that?

508
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:46,886
You killed Abel, so in order to
make things truly even-steven...

509
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,222
Abel has to kill me.
Mm-hmm.

510
00:19:49,256 --> 00:19:50,657
It does make sense.

511
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:54,294
So which way do you think
you're headed?

512
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:55,462
Once you finally pop off.

513
00:19:55,495 --> 00:19:57,764
Pearly gates or
blazing inferno?

514
00:19:57,797 --> 00:19:59,466
Be ironic if you went to all
this trouble

515
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:00,833
just to end up in a Hell loop.

516
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:03,236
I'd never punish myself
like that.

517
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,538
Hell is all about your own guilt
torturing you, right?

518
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:06,773
Right.
Well,

519
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:08,741
my conscience is clear.

520
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:10,243
Oh.

521
00:20:10,277 --> 00:20:11,511
Killing your brother
isn't the kind of thing

522
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:12,745
you just shake off.

523
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:14,414
Listen, Abel wanted
to kill me just as much

524
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:15,682
as I wanted to kill him.

525
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,284
Why do you think he's in Hell?

526
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:19,819
I'm just the guy
who won the fight.

527
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:23,290
Hello.

528
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:25,558
Where would I
and therefore Abel go next?

529
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:27,594
Wherever she's going.

530
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:31,298
(Kane sighs)

531
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:33,533
* Well, I got
to keep on walking *

532
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:36,035
* Yeah, I'm looking
for a phonograph *

533
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,837
* That'll play out loud...

534
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:41,408
Results from our samples
came back.

535
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:43,276
Liam told the truth.

536
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,412
No trace of explosive compounds
on the farm.

537
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:46,746
Or much else.
Hmm.

538
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:48,047
Unless you count
all the turkey jerky

539
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,782
he was hoarding
for the apocalypse.

540
00:20:49,816 --> 00:20:51,784
(chuckles)

541
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:53,653
"Bolivian crime organizations"?

542
00:20:53,686 --> 00:20:55,588
You're not taking Liam
seriously, are you?

543
00:20:55,622 --> 00:20:57,290
Okay, don't laugh,
but I've been looking into

544
00:20:57,324 --> 00:20:58,391
some of his theories.

545
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:00,393
Ring of evil carnies.

546
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:01,761
I'm calling it.

547
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:02,895
(both chuckle)

548
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,931
All right. Ella got back to me
with her bomb report.

549
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:06,899
It was made from fertilizer
that's banned in the U.S.,

550
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:08,435
but guess where
it's still being used.

551
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:09,836
Bolivia? No way.

552
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:11,538
Yeah. So I took a closer
look into Alexa's company

553
00:21:11,571 --> 00:21:13,840
to see if I could prove
a Bolivian connection.

554
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:15,408
Uh-huh.

555
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:17,910
She's got a lot
of international financiers,

556
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:19,946
which is pretty normal nowadays.

557
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:21,848
But I highlighted
the Bolivian ones.

558
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:23,983
Guess there was a grain of truth
in Liam's craziness.

559
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:27,387
We should cross-check that list
with the FBI and DHS.

560
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,389
I already did.
These names are linked up

561
00:21:29,422 --> 00:21:30,823
to the Bolivian drug cartel.

562
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:32,659
(computer chiming)

563
00:21:32,692 --> 00:21:34,927
This is my contact from the TSA.

564
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:40,767
One of the Bolivian contractors
landed in L.A. this morning.

565
00:21:41,868 --> 00:21:43,703
Wonder what he's doing here.

566
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:48,641
I know you can do it, Abel.

567
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:54,447
(chuckles)

568
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:57,750
Wait. Who are you?

569
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:00,653
How do you know all of this?

570
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:02,922
No!
(gunshot)

571
00:22:02,955 --> 00:22:04,424
That's her.

572
00:22:04,457 --> 00:22:05,558
(onlookers screaming)

573
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,399
What are you
doing here?

574
00:22:12,432 --> 00:22:14,501
Where'd he go? I mean,
where did she go?

575
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:15,802
I don't know.

576
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:16,869
(sighs)

577
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:24,477
I told you
to stay out of my way.

578
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:26,446
And I told you
Father cursed Kane for a reason.

579
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:28,781
You actually thought
that I would just

580
00:22:28,815 --> 00:22:31,651
sit around while you two idiots

581
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,386
were raising Abel?

582
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,687
I've been following you, Luci.

583
00:22:35,822 --> 00:22:37,590
So reckless,
even by your standards.

584
00:22:37,624 --> 00:22:39,892
(chuckles) Well, I think
it's rather brilliant, actually.

585
00:22:39,926 --> 00:22:43,029
Using the wings Dad
unfairly punished me with

586
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:45,598
to undo another one
of his unfair punishments.

587
00:22:45,632 --> 00:22:46,933
Do you seriously not realize

588
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:48,668
just how dangerous it is
to anger Father?

589
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:49,902
(scoffs)

590
00:22:49,936 --> 00:22:52,405
Have you also forgotten that
He took away your devil face?

591
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:54,407
Precisely my point, brother.

592
00:22:54,441 --> 00:22:56,042
I've got nothing left to lose.

593
00:22:56,075 --> 00:22:58,678
Oh, don't be foolish, Luci.

594
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:00,179
There are so many things

595
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,948
that Father can still
take away from you.

596
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:03,950
Again with the fearmongering.

597
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:07,920
For the nth time, I'm not going
to just take Dad's abuse.

598
00:23:07,954 --> 00:23:10,189
Cowering from Him
is your jam, remember?

599
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,759
You know what?

600
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:16,963
It's not you that I am trying
to prove my worth to.

601
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:19,666
So think what you will,
do what you will.

602
00:23:19,699 --> 00:23:22,835
I'm gonna find Abel and send him
back to where he belongs.

603
00:23:24,471 --> 00:23:25,505
Oh, so we're just gonna
let him leave,

604
00:23:25,538 --> 00:23:26,639
so he can get in our way later.

605
00:23:26,673 --> 00:23:28,841
No, no.

606
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:30,042
Next time, we'll be ready.

607
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:32,111
Bad news. Dead guy?

608
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:33,780
Bolivian cartel hit man.

609
00:23:33,813 --> 00:23:34,747
What?

610
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:38,017
The Bolivian cartel
wants to kill Bree? Why?

611
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,118
Don't know.

612
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,688
(sighs) There's no keeping this
from Decker anymore.

613
00:23:41,721 --> 00:23:43,790
Fine. I'll let you tell her.

614
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,530
Okay.

615
00:23:50,563 --> 00:23:53,232
Okay? That's it?

616
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,502
What, you're not gonna
tear him a new one?

617
00:23:55,535 --> 00:23:57,604
Come on, I've gotten
much worse for much less.

618
00:23:57,637 --> 00:23:59,472
I'm not gonna yell at my boss,

619
00:23:59,506 --> 00:24:02,675
even if he lost
our witness twice.

620
00:24:02,709 --> 00:24:05,011
Oh, because you've got
a soft spot for him?

621
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:06,813
Because I'm not an idiot.

622
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:09,782
Look, you're the lieutenant,
you call the shots.

623
00:24:09,816 --> 00:24:12,051
But the next time you want
to steal my partner

624
00:24:12,084 --> 00:24:14,654
to tail the target
of my investigation,

625
00:24:14,687 --> 00:24:16,088
you want to clue me in first?

626
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:18,525
Before it turns into
a public gunfight?

627
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:20,092
Deal. Next time.

628
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:22,094
You said "target."

629
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:24,697
Are you thinking the bomb was
meant for Bree and not Alexa?

630
00:24:24,731 --> 00:24:26,666
Well, maybe the Bolivians knew

631
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:28,000
that Bree always opened
her boss' mail,

632
00:24:28,034 --> 00:24:29,569
used it as a misdirect.

633
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:30,770
Well, I still
don't understand.

634
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:33,873
Why does the Bolivian cartel
want a Hollywood assistant dead?

635
00:24:33,906 --> 00:24:35,808
Did she neglect
to pick the pistachios

636
00:24:35,842 --> 00:24:36,909
off their quinoa salad?

637
00:24:36,943 --> 00:24:37,844
Well, that's the missing piece.

638
00:24:37,877 --> 00:24:39,979
So we should find out
what Alexa knows.

639
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:42,882
If I can have my partner back?
Of course.

640
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:44,784
I'll track down Bree,
I need to find him before...

641
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:45,818
You mean her.

642
00:24:45,852 --> 00:24:50,590
I need to find her
before the cartel does.

643
00:24:50,623 --> 00:24:52,892
Mm-hmm.

644
00:24:58,665 --> 00:25:00,633
So the bomb
wasn't for me.

645
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:01,834
Well, the intended target

646
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:04,303
was your assistant, Bree.
Have you heard from her lately?

647
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,539
What are you talking about?
Bree's in the hospital.

648
00:25:06,573 --> 00:25:07,674
She fled from the ER.

649
00:25:07,707 --> 00:25:09,809
No one's heard from her.
She could be in a lot of danger.

650
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,077
I guarantee she is.

651
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,580
Well, how's that
possible?

652
00:25:13,613 --> 00:25:16,015
I-I was told she suffered
fatal internal injuries.

653
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:19,018
Yes, well, you could say
she's like a new man.

654
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:19,886
(Alexa sighs)

655
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,655
Well, thank God,
but we need to find her.

656
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:25,191
We're doing everything we can
to make sure she's safe.

657
00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:27,560
What?
Oh, yes, yes, of course.

658
00:25:27,594 --> 00:25:29,696
That, too,
but I need her back so bad.

659
00:25:29,729 --> 00:25:31,964
Do you know what it's like
to have someone take away

660
00:25:31,998 --> 00:25:33,232
an assistant you depend on?

661
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:35,134
Yes, I do, actually.
(sighs)

662
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:37,937
I mean, I-I am seriously
lost here without her.

663
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,972
I-I don't even know how
to call out of the office.

664
00:25:40,006 --> 00:25:40,873
Do you know how?

665
00:25:40,907 --> 00:25:43,042
So you have no idea
what kind of beef

666
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:45,945
these Bolivian associates
of yours may have had with Bree?

667
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:47,246
I don't.

668
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,715
Bree is fluent in Spanish,

669
00:25:48,748 --> 00:25:50,583
so she dealt with those
investors directly.

670
00:25:50,617 --> 00:25:52,351
And you didn't think
to vet them at all

671
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,586
before you went
into business with them?

672
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:56,756
Have you seen the films I make?
I can't afford to be picky.

673
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:58,725
Someone offers me money,
I take it.

674
00:25:58,758 --> 00:26:01,060
Okay, well, I'm gonna need to
see any documented interactions

675
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:02,128
you have with these investors.

676
00:26:02,161 --> 00:26:04,697
Absolutely, they're in there.
Okay.

677
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:11,037
Oh, right.

678
00:26:12,639 --> 00:26:15,107
Only Bree's fingerprint
can unlock it.

679
00:26:15,141 --> 00:26:17,877
Bree installed a biometric lock
on the file cabinet?

680
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,178
Seems a little paranoid.

681
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:21,080
What did she
have to hide?

682
00:26:22,949 --> 00:26:25,384
Two recent incoming wires
for 50 grand each,

683
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,119
both from a South
American bank.
Bingo.

684
00:26:27,153 --> 00:26:29,188
Shady side business
with the Bolivians it is.

685
00:26:29,221 --> 00:26:32,224
So Bree was embezzling
from that useless boss of hers.

686
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:33,693
Huh, who can blame her?

687
00:26:33,726 --> 00:26:35,962
Does loyalty mean
nothing to you?

688
00:26:35,995 --> 00:26:38,631
Alexa gave Bree
her first job in Hollywood.

689
00:26:38,665 --> 00:26:39,766
She trained her.

690
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:41,834
You don't just
ditch that

691
00:26:41,868 --> 00:26:44,804
the minute some
big-armed, blue-eyed,

692
00:26:44,837 --> 00:26:45,638
toned...

693
00:26:45,672 --> 00:26:48,775
Bolivian drug lord
comes around, okay?

694
00:26:48,808 --> 00:26:49,876
Y-you, you don't, you don't.

695
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:52,011
Dan, if Bree bolted from the ER,

696
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:53,980
maybe she left some things
behind, like her phone.

697
00:26:54,013 --> 00:26:56,315
Mm-hmm, which could hold proof

698
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:58,150
to her connection
with the Bolivians.

699
00:26:58,184 --> 00:26:59,886
That's good thinking.
I'm gonna check on that.

700
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:00,920
Okay, thanks.

701
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,121
All right,
I'm gonna see if Pierce

702
00:27:02,154 --> 00:27:03,222
had any luck finding Bree.

703
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:05,024
Oh, well,
he won't need any luck.

704
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:06,893
He's got something
far better than that.

705
00:27:06,926 --> 00:27:09,328
Decker's right. You're cute.

706
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:12,765
But I'm mid-bounty
and I just got a lead.

707
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:13,966
So, if you don't mind...

708
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,302
Lucifer told me to tell you
this is exactly the opposite

709
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:18,237
of what Amenadiel wants.

710
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,139
I'm in.

711
00:27:20,172 --> 00:27:22,141
Great.

712
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:23,876
How do we find him?
Well...

713
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:27,246
Your brother's
a predictable one.

714
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,316
He always runs to food or boobs.

715
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:31,784
Usually boobs.

716
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:33,319
That's how we found him
the first time.

717
00:27:33,352 --> 00:27:36,022
Now he has boobs, that might
change his itinerary.

718
00:27:36,055 --> 00:27:38,124
That's right,
I totally forgot about that.

719
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:40,827
(chuckles) Is he hot?

720
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,229
Just tell me how we find him.

721
00:27:43,262 --> 00:27:44,330
Well, every now and again,

722
00:27:44,363 --> 00:27:47,366
the sucker would do something
I never saw coming.

723
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:48,968
(elevator bell dings)

724
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,136
Hello, Kane.

725
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:51,904
And good-bye.
(gunshot)

726
00:27:51,938 --> 00:27:53,239
(groans)

727
00:27:56,876 --> 00:27:58,144
Just like that.

728
00:28:02,782 --> 00:28:04,250
Yes! (grunts) Finally!

729
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:05,384
Slayed you before

730
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,319
you slayed me! (grunts)

731
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:08,755
Ashes to ashes,

732
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:10,456
you bastard!

733
00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:12,324
(grunts rhythmically)

734
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:14,961
Enjoy it while
it lasts, Abel.

735
00:28:14,994 --> 00:28:17,296
How do you know my name?

736
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:18,931
And what is that
supposed to mean?

737
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:21,433
(grunting)

738
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:30,576
Thanks for the heads-up.

739
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:33,946
You said you wanted to die.
Make up your mind, cupcake.

740
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,848
And the mark is still there.

741
00:28:35,882 --> 00:28:38,350
(sobbing) Please, no.
No, please.

742
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:39,852
Please.

743
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:42,421
Just make it quick, Kane.
Please make it quick.

744
00:28:44,523 --> 00:28:46,425
No.

745
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:49,328
I need you alive,
so you can help me die.

746
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:52,298
Wait, what?

747
00:28:52,331 --> 00:28:54,400
This has to be a trick.
You always kill me.

748
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:56,302
That was when you were in Hell,

749
00:28:56,335 --> 00:28:58,437
where you've spent
the last few millennia.

750
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,940
Maze tortured you
in the afterlife.

751
00:29:00,973 --> 00:29:03,943
Your punishment
was to get killed

752
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:06,813
by me, over and over.

753
00:29:06,846 --> 00:29:08,380
MAZE:
That's right.

754
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:10,783
You were trapped in a Hell loop,
but now you're out.

755
00:29:12,518 --> 00:29:15,021
You're alive, brother.

756
00:29:16,889 --> 00:29:18,490
(imitates explosion)

757
00:29:22,061 --> 00:29:23,529
Turns out Abel killing me
didn't remove the mark.

758
00:29:23,562 --> 00:29:25,497
Mm-hmm. Right, yes,
I got that from the whole

759
00:29:25,531 --> 00:29:27,033
"you still being alive"
of it all.

760
00:29:27,066 --> 00:29:29,969
So much for making
everything even-steven.

761
00:29:30,002 --> 00:29:31,370
It's now time for Plan "C."

762
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:33,339
(scoffs)
I didn't realize we had one.

763
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:35,007
We don't.

764
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:36,909
But we'll think of something.

765
00:29:36,943 --> 00:29:38,544
Okay, and how is bringing
your she-brother

766
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:40,312
into the precinct
going to help?

767
00:29:40,346 --> 00:29:43,382
Much as I'm enjoying his
Basic Instinct routine.

768
00:29:43,415 --> 00:29:44,951
First things first,
we have to make sure

769
00:29:44,984 --> 00:29:46,052
the Bolivians
don't kill him.

770
00:29:48,054 --> 00:29:49,021
Bree.

771
00:29:49,055 --> 00:29:51,457
I'm Detective Decker.

772
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:54,360
This is Charlotte Richards
from the DA's office.

773
00:29:54,393 --> 00:29:55,394
Miss Garland,
do you confirm

774
00:29:55,427 --> 00:29:57,997
that you're waiving
your right to legal council?

775
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:02,068
Yes. Woman, I will waive
whatever you want me to waive.

776
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:06,839
Uh, Lieutenant said
he had noticed

777
00:30:06,873 --> 00:30:08,440
some PTSD symptoms,

778
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:09,508
so we should just
kind of roll with it

779
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:11,844
if we can.

780
00:30:11,878 --> 00:30:14,546
Don't take this lightly,
Miss Garland.

781
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,015
It's a big decision.

782
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:19,051
Mmm. Not as big as my flock.

783
00:30:19,085 --> 00:30:21,487
Do you know how many
sheep I possess?

784
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,356
Enough for two wives.

785
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:27,093
Enough to feed
our offspring

786
00:30:27,126 --> 00:30:29,495
and our offspring's offspring.

787
00:30:29,528 --> 00:30:30,496
LUCIFER:
He fits right in.

788
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:33,032
Is it me, or is your plan
going down in flames?

789
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:34,366
It'll work.

790
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,369
Well, as impressive
as your flock sounds,

791
00:30:37,403 --> 00:30:38,905
let's get back
to the deal.

792
00:30:38,938 --> 00:30:41,440
The terms are simple.

793
00:30:41,473 --> 00:30:42,508
You share all the
information you have

794
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:45,077
on the Bolivian cartel
in exchange for immunity.

795
00:30:45,111 --> 00:30:47,046
And the full protection
of the LAPD.

796
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:49,548
Yes, to whatever
those words mean.

797
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:53,519
Now, let's discuss who is going
to lay with me first.

798
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:57,556
Uh, don't you want to read
the terms of the deal, at least?

799
00:30:57,589 --> 00:31:00,960
What for? I've been told
you're very wise.

800
00:31:00,993 --> 00:31:02,528
I trust you.

801
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:03,662
CHARLOTTE:
Just like that?

802
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,464
You're going to
let us drive this,

803
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:07,566
just completely give up control?

804
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:08,567
Mm-hmm.

805
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,502
Doesn't that scare you?

806
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:14,506
Not nearly as much as the place
I just escaped.

807
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,643
I would do anything to avoid
returning to that Hell.

808
00:31:17,676 --> 00:31:19,878
If you'd been there,
you would do the same.

809
00:31:24,984 --> 00:31:25,952
Charlotte.

810
00:31:25,985 --> 00:31:28,454
Yes, sorry,
we're good.

811
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:31,557
Great. Great.
Okay, Bree?

812
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,092
Mm-hmm.
Come on, you're
coming with me.

813
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:36,528
(sharp inhale)
Mm, you smell good.

814
00:31:39,065 --> 00:31:42,034
Well so much for her being
released into your custody.

815
00:31:42,068 --> 00:31:44,003
We can't let him spend
too much time with Decker.

816
00:31:44,036 --> 00:31:45,404
She'll figure out
something's going on.

817
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:47,473
(sighs) Let me see
what I can do.

818
00:31:57,616 --> 00:31:59,418
It's time for you
to go home, Abel.

819
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:01,553
It wasn't easy for me
to track you down,

820
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:03,922
but you're not getting away
from me this time.

821
00:32:06,058 --> 00:32:08,094
What the...

822
00:32:08,127 --> 00:32:11,497
MAZE: Meet my
punching bag.

823
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:13,532
Look familiar?

824
00:32:13,565 --> 00:32:17,669
Mazikeen.
What are you doing here?

825
00:32:17,703 --> 00:32:20,006
What does it look like?

826
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:22,208
Keeping you out
of Lucifer's way.

827
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:26,445
(shouts)

828
00:32:26,478 --> 00:32:28,014
I don't want to
fight you, Mazikeen.

829
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:30,983
Who cares what you want?

830
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,622
So you worked here
for two years,

831
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:37,456
it's still not ringing a bell?

832
00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:39,691
No, but your backside
is ringing a...

833
00:32:39,725 --> 00:32:41,193
Oh, you poor, forgetful thing.

834
00:32:41,227 --> 00:32:42,694
Thankfully, all we need
is your fingerprint.

835
00:32:42,728 --> 00:32:45,097
Well, my finger goes wherever
the lady tells me it goes.

836
00:32:45,131 --> 00:32:47,133
(phone ringing, vibrating)

837
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:49,501
Hey, Dan. Did you have any
luck finding Bree's phone?

838
00:32:49,535 --> 00:32:50,702
DAN:
No.

839
00:32:50,736 --> 00:32:52,504
Because guess who collected
her stuff from the hospital?

840
00:32:52,538 --> 00:32:54,606
Alexa.

841
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,607
That's odd.

842
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:56,475
Yeah, right?

843
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:58,010
So, I dug deeper.

844
00:32:58,044 --> 00:32:59,611
Looked into her Pilates alibi.

845
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:01,580
Get this: her class

846
00:33:01,613 --> 00:33:02,581
is actually in the morning.

847
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:05,617
She rescheduled that day
for 2:00 p.m. exactly.

848
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:07,686
It's like she knew to be
out of the office.

849
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:09,121
She knew the bomb was coming.

850
00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:10,789
Who knew?
Alexa.

851
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,624
What, and the Bolivians
warned her? Why?

852
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:14,526
Put it on speakerphone.
(sighs)

853
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,663
Okay, maybe the Bolivians were
working with Alexa, not Bree.

854
00:33:17,696 --> 00:33:19,665
Maybe Bree found out
what they were up to

855
00:33:19,698 --> 00:33:20,732
and wanted to blow the whistle.

856
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:22,534
Well, that would explain

857
00:33:22,568 --> 00:33:24,703
those incoming wires
in Bree's account.

858
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,606
Cartel tried to pay her off,
silence her.

859
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:29,208
And when the nice way
didn't work,

860
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:30,442
they tried the not-so-nice way.

861
00:33:30,476 --> 00:33:33,745
Well, hopefully the proof is
behind drawer number one, so...

862
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:34,746
Wait a minute.

863
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,648
Why would Alexa send us
straight to the place

864
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:38,550
where we'd find proof
of her crimes?

865
00:33:38,584 --> 00:33:39,618
Makes no sense.

866
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:41,187
Unless...

867
00:33:42,088 --> 00:33:43,689
...it's a trap.

868
00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:45,757
Bree, wait!

869
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:47,526
(clicks, beeps)

870
00:33:50,129 --> 00:33:52,664
Don't move.

871
00:34:02,308 --> 00:34:03,409
DAN:
Alexa knew Bree would need proof

872
00:34:03,442 --> 00:34:05,744
to turn her in, so she must have
rigged the file cabinet

873
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:07,579
that contained it.
We walked right into her trap.

874
00:34:07,613 --> 00:34:09,115
If they move,
the whole thing blows.

875
00:34:09,148 --> 00:34:10,549
Call the bomb squad.

876
00:34:10,582 --> 00:34:12,618
PIERCE: Decker, you need to get
out of there, stat.

877
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:14,153
I'm not going anywhere,
Lieutenant.

878
00:34:14,186 --> 00:34:15,721
What do you mean,
you're not going anywhere?

879
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:17,789
You need to get
out of there, now.

880
00:34:17,823 --> 00:34:19,725
Don't worry,
I'm staying right here.

881
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:21,660
Oh, woman,
your loyalty touches me.

882
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:23,129
PIERCE: What happened to
"You're the lieutenant,

883
00:34:23,162 --> 00:34:23,962
you call the shots"?

884
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:25,731
CHLOE:
There is an innocent victim

885
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:27,733
glued to a bomb.

886
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:30,602
"Innocent victim"
is highly debatable.

887
00:34:30,636 --> 00:34:32,171
Lucifer, Bree was trying to do
the right thing.

888
00:34:32,204 --> 00:34:34,773
It's why the Bolivians
and Alexa want her dead.

889
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:35,741
I'm not leaving.

890
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:36,842
ABEL:
Oh, my flock

891
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:38,677
is your flock,
this I swear.

892
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,778
PIERCE:
Okay.

893
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:41,613
No, no, no, o-opposite of okay.

894
00:34:41,647 --> 00:34:43,749
PIERCE:
If you're gonna stay, Decker,

895
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:44,883
I can talk you through
defusing it.

896
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,585
It's safer
than waiting for it

897
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:47,586
to blow up before the bomb squad
gets there...

898
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:49,188
Wait a minute.
Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

899
00:34:49,221 --> 00:34:51,190
Chloe, Chloe,
think about this, okay?

900
00:34:51,223 --> 00:34:52,724
Think about Trixie.

901
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:54,793
I am thinking about her.

902
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:57,596
And I'm also thinking
that Bree's a daughter, too.

903
00:34:57,629 --> 00:34:58,764
Oh, come on.

904
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:01,867
So...
(sighs)

905
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,303
...what do I do now? What,

906
00:35:04,336 --> 00:35:06,172
cut all these wires willy-nilly?

907
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:08,807
Damn movies. No.

908
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,177
You have to get into the box
and disconnect the trigger.

909
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:12,378
And, very carefully,

910
00:35:12,411 --> 00:35:13,812
remove the blasting cap.

911
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:15,347
Ugh, this is madness.

912
00:35:15,381 --> 00:35:16,882
PIERCE:
Then toss it as far as possible.

913
00:35:16,915 --> 00:35:19,751
Oh, you want her to toss an
explosive, that sounds safe.

914
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:22,654
If the cap goes off away from
the charge, it'll be harmless.

915
00:35:22,688 --> 00:35:25,257
Lieutenant!
I understand why your priority

916
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:27,259
is to save your...

917
00:35:27,293 --> 00:35:29,328
this young woman, but I
will not let you endanger

918
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:30,829
the detective's life
in the process.

919
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,631
He's not endangering my life.

920
00:35:32,664 --> 00:35:35,201
I am choosing to be here,
and if you're not gonna help,

921
00:35:35,234 --> 00:35:36,768
you should probably just leave.

922
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:38,670
Well, we both know
I'm not gonna do that.

923
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:41,840
I'm your partner.

924
00:35:44,343 --> 00:35:46,712
Okay, good.

925
00:35:46,745 --> 00:35:48,214
Then listen to me--
I'm gonna need both my hands,

926
00:35:48,247 --> 00:35:49,348
so please come help me.

927
00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:51,350
Okay? Hold this.

928
00:35:53,452 --> 00:35:55,687
I'll use this,
and, uh...

929
00:35:55,721 --> 00:35:56,855
All right.

930
00:35:58,724 --> 00:36:00,726
(bomb beeping)

931
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:02,794
(quietly):
Easy...

932
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,932
CHLOE:
Got the blasting cap.

933
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,735
And...

934
00:36:13,772 --> 00:36:15,841
Okay.

935
00:36:15,874 --> 00:36:19,811
I think that means you can
take your thumb off now.

936
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:21,313
(beeps)

937
00:36:21,347 --> 00:36:22,414
All right.

938
00:36:22,448 --> 00:36:23,849
And don't tell us

939
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:25,451
where you want to put it next.

940
00:36:25,484 --> 00:36:26,852
MAZE:
Up your butt!

941
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:29,221
(panting)

942
00:36:29,255 --> 00:36:30,789
That's where I want
to shove this.

943
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:34,360
And then, I'll press the button.

944
00:36:34,393 --> 00:36:36,462
I don't even understand
why you're so angry.

945
00:36:36,495 --> 00:36:39,365
So what if Linda and I
got together?

946
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:43,769
You dumped me.

947
00:36:43,802 --> 00:36:45,704
Remember?

948
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:48,240
No, it's not about that.

949
00:36:48,274 --> 00:36:50,776
Okay? It's about the betrayal.

950
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:51,810
The dirty...

951
00:36:52,811 --> 00:36:53,879
...sneaky...

952
00:36:55,781 --> 00:36:56,748
...lies!

953
00:36:56,782 --> 00:36:57,949
When will
you understand

954
00:36:57,983 --> 00:37:00,952
that we were trying
to protect you?

955
00:37:00,986 --> 00:37:03,789
And when will you understand
I don't believe you?

956
00:37:03,822 --> 00:37:06,858
(sighs)

957
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:07,826
All right.

958
00:37:10,296 --> 00:37:11,430
Fine.

959
00:37:15,801 --> 00:37:19,338
(both panting)

960
00:37:19,371 --> 00:37:21,840
Well, come on!

961
00:37:21,873 --> 00:37:24,776
Come on! It's no fun
if you just stand there!

962
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:26,312
It's about as much fun
as watching you

963
00:37:26,345 --> 00:37:28,280
break Linda's heart, I'd say.

964
00:37:28,314 --> 00:37:29,815
(yells)

965
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:33,885
(grunts)

966
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:37,323
Even this, you had to ruin.

967
00:37:43,895 --> 00:37:49,435
(door opens, closes)

968
00:37:49,468 --> 00:37:50,869
(police radio chatter)

969
00:37:50,902 --> 00:37:53,805
Okay, thank you.

970
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:55,073
Hi.

971
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,475
So, we were able to lift

972
00:37:56,508 --> 00:37:58,544
one of Alexa's prints
from the explosive.

973
00:37:58,577 --> 00:37:59,911
Oh, good.

974
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:01,480
Sounds like enough
to arrest her for murder.

975
00:38:01,513 --> 00:38:03,048
And get her to flip
on the Bolivians.

976
00:38:03,081 --> 00:38:04,883
Apparently, she was using
her movies to launder money

977
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:06,352
for the cartel.

978
00:38:06,385 --> 00:38:08,086
And that's what Bree
was trying to expose.

979
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:11,323
Shame. I mean, I had the perfect
title for The Plunge 2.

980
00:38:12,591 --> 00:38:13,825
2 Deep 2 Plunge.

981
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:14,993
With the number two, each time,

982
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:16,094
instead of... the word.
Instead of the word.

983
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,363
(both chuckle)
Yeah, I get it.

984
00:38:17,396 --> 00:38:18,430
It's funny.

985
00:38:18,464 --> 00:38:19,898
Yeah.
Yeah.

986
00:38:19,931 --> 00:38:21,367
So...

987
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,801
(clears throat)

988
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:24,570
...I just wanted
to say thank you, again.

989
00:38:26,505 --> 00:38:28,374
I couldn't have done it
without you.

990
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:31,943
Night.

991
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,516
Without me...

992
00:38:37,549 --> 00:38:42,087
you wouldn't have been in danger
in the first place.

993
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:46,492
CHARLOTTE:
I'm sorry about last time.

994
00:38:46,525 --> 00:38:48,594
I'm a bit of a control freak.

995
00:38:48,627 --> 00:38:49,861
Ah.

996
00:38:49,895 --> 00:38:50,896
Really?

997
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:51,930
I hadn't noticed.

998
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:53,965
(chuckles softly)

999
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:54,966
So, what's changed?

1000
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,935
Well, I realized

1001
00:38:56,968 --> 00:38:59,037
that you're right,
you're the expert.

1002
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:02,007
And I should
trust you.

1003
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:05,544
And as scary as that is...
(sighs)

1004
00:39:05,577 --> 00:39:07,078
...there's something
much scarier.

1005
00:39:09,448 --> 00:39:12,451
I, um, I wake up...

1006
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,954
...smell coffee.

1007
00:39:15,987 --> 00:39:16,922
It's nice.

1008
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:18,056
I have breakfast

1009
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:19,525
with my family.

1010
00:39:19,558 --> 00:39:21,427
Uh, we're happy.

1011
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,962
(chuckles)

1012
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:25,030
At peace.

1013
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:26,932
And then, a man

1014
00:39:26,965 --> 00:39:29,901
walks in
and shoots each of them.

1015
00:39:29,935 --> 00:39:31,102
Dead.

1016
00:39:31,136 --> 00:39:34,873
And I know this man because he's
somebody that I represented,

1017
00:39:34,906 --> 00:39:38,477
and I know that he should be
in jail, but he's not.

1018
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:41,947
Because of me.

1019
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,952
I just smile,

1020
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:50,055
while my family is killed.

1021
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:54,926
I don't move a muscle.

1022
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,095
(shuddering breath)

1023
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:59,931
Because I'm the reason
that it's happening.

1024
00:39:59,965 --> 00:40:02,300
I'm the reason that he's free.

1025
00:40:06,171 --> 00:40:08,640
And then, I wake up.

1026
00:40:08,674 --> 00:40:12,010
It's a new morning.

1027
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:14,179
I smell the same coffee.

1028
00:40:16,214 --> 00:40:19,451
Pour the same cereal.

1029
00:40:19,485 --> 00:40:23,154
And then, someone else walks in,

1030
00:40:23,188 --> 00:40:25,457
and shoots my family.

1031
00:40:27,493 --> 00:40:30,228
This time,
it's a different person.

1032
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:33,465
Someone else I set free.

1033
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:42,474
And I just...

1034
00:40:42,508 --> 00:40:45,944
smile again.

1035
00:40:45,977 --> 00:40:48,980
And I die inside again.

1036
00:40:49,014 --> 00:40:52,050
Over and over, and...

1037
00:40:55,286 --> 00:41:00,025
I don't know what it'll take
to stay out of that place.

1038
00:41:03,061 --> 00:41:06,164
I'm trying my best.

1039
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:09,200
But I don't know
if it'll be enough.

1040
00:41:13,071 --> 00:41:17,643
Well, it's a very brave start.

1041
00:41:19,044 --> 00:41:22,047
* I don't believe in Satan

1042
00:41:25,551 --> 00:41:27,152
* But he believes in me...

1043
00:41:29,788 --> 00:41:32,190
Thank you
for saving my life, Kane.

1044
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:35,160
I suppose we're even now.

1045
00:41:35,193 --> 00:41:36,094
(sighs)

1046
00:41:36,127 --> 00:41:38,029
Yet, this is still there.

1047
00:41:38,063 --> 00:41:39,130
Hmm.

1048
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:41,800
This whole time, you've been
in a kind of Hell, too.

1049
00:41:43,669 --> 00:41:46,204
You still are.

1050
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:48,006
I'm sorry.

1051
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:49,775
I'm sorry, too, brother.

1052
00:41:49,808 --> 00:41:52,177
(exhales)

1053
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:55,714
Your face is still
the face of my torturer.

1054
00:41:55,747 --> 00:41:57,716
Fair enough.

1055
00:41:57,749 --> 00:41:59,284
I guess we still
need some space.

1056
00:41:59,317 --> 00:42:02,588
That, we can agree on.

1057
00:42:02,621 --> 00:42:05,023
* He's the master of deceit

1058
00:42:05,056 --> 00:42:08,293
* I don't believe in Satan...

1059
00:42:08,326 --> 00:42:11,563
Ah, that was
quite civil, actually.

1060
00:42:13,131 --> 00:42:15,133
I know I promised to help you
end your curse,

1061
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:19,771
but I'm afraid we need
to dissolve our unholy alliance.

1062
00:42:19,805 --> 00:42:22,674
Why?

1063
00:42:22,708 --> 00:42:25,143
The risk is too great.

1064
00:42:25,176 --> 00:42:27,045
I mean, I don't mind
putting myself in danger,

1065
00:42:27,078 --> 00:42:28,213
but the detective?

1066
00:42:29,615 --> 00:42:32,818
If she had died,
it would have been my fault.

1067
00:42:32,851 --> 00:42:35,253
But you're the Devil,
you always keep your word.

1068
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:36,487
I do.

1069
00:42:36,521 --> 00:42:40,258
So I hope you understand how
difficult a decision this was.

1070
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:44,195
And yet, oddly,
the easiest I've ever made.

1071
00:42:47,132 --> 00:42:49,267
Well, I'm not done.

1072
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,604
Abel's how my curse started,
he's got to be the way it ends.

1073
00:42:52,638 --> 00:42:55,073
As long as he's alive,
I still have hope.

1074
00:42:55,106 --> 00:42:56,241
(tires screech)

1075
00:42:57,709 --> 00:42:59,177
(Kane sighs)

1076
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:01,146
(chuckles)

1077
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,214
(siren wailing)

1078
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:06,184
No!
