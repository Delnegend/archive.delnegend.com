1
00:00:01,402 --> 00:00:03,537
Previously on Lucifer...
So, you are the Devil,

2
00:00:03,571 --> 00:00:05,406
and you've left Hell behind

3
00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:08,076
to take a vacation
in Los Angeles.

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:09,110
Well, where else would I go?

5
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:11,145
I got it. I got it. The name.

6
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:12,012
The whole Lucifer thing.

7
00:00:12,046 --> 00:00:14,182
And desire's, like,
your superpower.

8
00:00:14,215 --> 00:00:15,483
Mm, it's more like
a gift from God, really.

9
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:17,751
My God. Your dad
did that to you?

10
00:00:17,785 --> 00:00:19,487
No, that's where
I cut my wings off.

11
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,089
LUCIFER:
Mum's powers are returning,

12
00:00:21,122 --> 00:00:23,557
and it won't be long
before we can't contain them.

13
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:26,094
I'm afraid that this ends now.

14
00:00:26,127 --> 00:00:27,628
(yells) Bloody
hell, it worked!

15
00:00:30,198 --> 00:00:32,133
Who are you?
I should never have

16
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:34,235
got you involved in any
of this from the start.

17
00:00:34,268 --> 00:00:36,170
I just realized something
that I need to do.

18
00:00:36,204 --> 00:00:37,305
Detective,

19
00:00:37,338 --> 00:00:38,506
I'm coming over now

20
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,441
to tell you the truth about me.

21
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:52,386
*

22
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:57,091
* Mm, mm

23
00:00:57,125 --> 00:01:00,161
* The devil you know, the devil
you know, the devil you don't *

24
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:02,196
* 'Cause it's better to know *

25
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,732
* The devil you know
than the devil you don't *

26
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:06,834
* 'Cause wherever you go,
wherever you go *

27
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:08,869
* With the devil you know
you're never alone *

28
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,405
* But it's better to know
the devil you know *

29
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,408
* Than the devil you don't,
yeah, ay *

30
00:01:14,442 --> 00:01:16,577
* Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh *

31
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,546
* Ooh, ooh, ooh,
ooh, ooh *

32
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:22,450
* Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh *

33
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:26,254
* The devil you know
* Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh... *

34
00:01:26,287 --> 00:01:27,488
(horn honking)

35
00:01:32,226 --> 00:01:33,861
Are you blind?

36
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:37,865
(metal creaking)

37
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:42,170
(grunts loudly)

38
00:01:42,203 --> 00:01:43,671
(laughs quietly)

39
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:45,139
(exhales)

40
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,842
The day I've had, I tell you.

41
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:51,812
Right. I'd like a ride
to Los Angeles, please.

42
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,247
I-- oh.

43
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:54,182
Dearie me.

44
00:01:54,215 --> 00:01:55,583
At least I'm healing fast.

45
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,285
Do you have any aloe vera?

46
00:01:57,318 --> 00:01:59,253
I ain't going back to L.A.

47
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:01,255
What...

48
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:04,925
Hold on, you're not a real
armored truck driver, are you?

49
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,727
Wait.

50
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,929
Don't I know you from somewhere?

51
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,364
Oh, yes, yes.

52
00:02:10,398 --> 00:02:11,699
You're that jewelry thief,

53
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:14,168
the one who left in nothing
but his manties.

54
00:02:14,202 --> 00:02:15,303
You!

55
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:17,205
You got me put in jail!

56
00:02:17,238 --> 00:02:19,307
Uh, well, I think
that one's on you, sir.

57
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,742
I wasn't the one
with the gun and the ski mask.
I'm not gonna

58
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:23,911
let you screw this up
for me again.

59
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:25,546
It's time for you to go.

60
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:27,181
(chuckles)
Well, you are a tenacious one,

61
00:02:27,215 --> 00:02:28,516
I'll give you that.

62
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:29,383
Respect.

63
00:02:29,417 --> 00:02:31,185
You one
crazy-ass bitch.

64
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:33,287
Now, get out
of the truck.

65
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:34,288
(gun cocks)
Now.

66
00:02:34,322 --> 00:02:35,723
Look...

67
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:37,825
I know you don't want
to shoot me, Mr....

68
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:38,759
What's your name?

69
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:41,529
Said out, bitch.
Mr. Said Out Bitch, tell me,

70
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:43,531
what is it you really desire?

71
00:02:48,436 --> 00:02:50,371
I just want
to get out of here, man.

72
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:52,373
Right, freedom, of course.

73
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:54,808
(siren wailing in distance)
That hasn't changed.

74
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:59,280
(sighs) Well, then we might
be able to help each other.

75
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:03,183
(sirens wailing)

76
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,559
OFFICER:
Suspect heading towards us.

77
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:12,926
Prepare the blockade.

78
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:31,512
(brakes squeal)

79
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:34,682
OFFICER:
I can't see though.

80
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:39,520
OFFICER 2: Eyes on.
OFFICER 3: Easy, easy.

81
00:03:40,788 --> 00:03:44,024
(horn honking
"Shave and a Haircut, two bits")

82
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,694
(officers clamoring)

83
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,629
(Lucifer sighs)
OFFICER: Don't move!

84
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:50,364
(gun cocks)
Hello, there.

85
00:03:50,398 --> 00:03:51,565
Hands in the air!

86
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,933
That won't be necessary.

87
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,468
I'm Lucifer Morningstar,

88
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:56,003
consultant for the LAPD.

89
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:58,372
I've apprehended
this stolen vehicle

90
00:03:58,406 --> 00:04:00,374
and all of its contents.

91
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:01,909
You're welcome.
Hands up!

92
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:04,378
Down on the ground!
Well, I'd really rather not.

93
00:04:04,412 --> 00:04:06,380
I've just got into
some clean clothes.

94
00:04:06,414 --> 00:04:07,748
Partner name and badge number!

95
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,483
Oh, for goodness' sake.
Detective Decker.

96
00:04:09,517 --> 00:04:11,452
I'm afraid I don't know
her badge number.

97
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:13,387
Detective Decker.
But I'd say with certainty

98
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:15,856
she's a 34-B, if that helps.

99
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,960
Hot as hell out here, isn't it?

100
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,629
Well, close, anyway.

101
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:23,397
Checks out.
Well, of course

102
00:04:23,431 --> 00:04:26,334
it does-- I'm never wrong
when it comes to cup size.

103
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:28,336
Okay.

104
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:31,004
Hold on! What'd you do
with the real thief?
Well, unfortunately,

105
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:32,340
he got away.

106
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:33,574
But not to worry.

107
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,409
I don't think
he'll be bothering you

108
00:04:35,443 --> 00:04:37,811
for a very, very long time.

109
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:40,848
* The devil you know, the devil
you know, the devil you don't *

110
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:43,317
* 'Cause it's better to know
the devil you know *

111
00:04:43,351 --> 00:04:45,619
* Than the devil you don't *

112
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:47,621
* 'Cause wherever you go,
wherever you go *

113
00:04:47,655 --> 00:04:49,757
* With the devil you know
you're never alone *

114
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,426
* But it's better to know
the devil you know *

115
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,027
* Than the devil you don't. *

116
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:55,463
(elevator bell dings)

117
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,936
Ah. Good.

118
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,071
You're here.

119
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:07,107
Well, I wasn't sure what
you fancied, so I ordered

120
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,376
a little of everything.

121
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:09,810
Thank you, Benjamin.

122
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:14,448
Lucifer, what is all of this?

123
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:16,584
This is your new
wellness regime.

124
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:18,419
I thought since
I was responsible

125
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:20,354
for your current state, the
least I could do is heal you.

126
00:05:20,388 --> 00:05:23,123
And yes, Benjamin is part
of the package. (chuckles)

127
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,992
He'll be back after dark.

128
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:27,961
Oh, well, don't worry,
he'll be gentle.

129
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:28,862
Mm.

130
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:31,131
What? I just want
to take care of you.

131
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,500
Is that so hard to believe?

132
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:33,501
Yes. Out with it.

133
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:34,935
What's going on?
(sighs)

134
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:44,878
(snickers) Talk about
insult to injury.

135
00:05:44,912 --> 00:05:48,482
I-I-I didn't know
that they could grow back.

136
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:49,550
Are wings

137
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:52,553
like... body hair?

138
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:54,755
No. Don't be so ridiculous.

139
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:56,524
This is Dad's
latest stunt.

140
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:58,392
A celestial spanking,
if you will.

141
00:05:58,426 --> 00:06:01,562
I suppose that's what
I get for giving Mum
her own universe.

142
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:02,996
Holy crap!

143
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,164
Exactly.

144
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,967
Mm. But it's no biggie.

145
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,103
I cut them off once,
and I can cut them off again.

146
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:12,440
Now, I'd have Maze do it,
but she's off

147
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:13,541
bounty hunting
again, and...

148
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:16,577
well, I thought, what,
with your medical expertise

149
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,111
and training...
Even if I was

150
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:20,414
that kind of doctor,
I'm pretty sure

151
00:06:20,448 --> 00:06:22,650
they're not teaching
wing-ectomies in med school.
No, no, no,

152
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:25,719
it's quite simple--
it's just snip, snip,
and Bob's your uncle.

153
00:06:25,753 --> 00:06:27,488
Well, God's your Father,
Lucifer.

154
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:29,122
And things are never
simple with Him.

155
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:31,592
You don't know why for sure
your wings have returned.

156
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:32,693
They've returned

157
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,762
because Dad is a control freak.

158
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:37,631
He's pissed off
that He can't get Mum back,

159
00:06:37,665 --> 00:06:39,467
so He stuck my wings back on.

160
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,536
But I am not
His Mr. Potato Head.

161
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,938
And don't worry, I fully plan
to track down Dad's emissary

162
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:47,475
on Earth, and give him
a return message. But for now...

163
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:51,111
Emissary? You think God sent
someone to do this to you?

164
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,546
Never mind all that.

165
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,448
Right now I need you to help me.

166
00:06:54,482 --> 00:06:56,016
So come on, chop-chop.

167
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:57,017
No.

168
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,487
As your therapist,
I'm sorry,

169
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,522
but I can't do this.

170
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:03,123
Well, as a friend, then.
Yes, as a friend

171
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:06,159
who got caught in the
cross fire, I beg you, please,

172
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:09,830
think this through
before you do something rash.

173
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:10,831
I...

174
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:14,434
I almost died
because of your family drama.

175
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,039
Right.

176
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:22,175
(sighs)
But you can definitely text me
Ben's number, though.

177
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,916
(whispers):
Okay.

178
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:32,620
Oh, gosh, it's hard enough
just to scratch your own back.

179
00:07:35,523 --> 00:07:39,627
Right, it's okay, it's okay, you
can call off the search party.

180
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,562
I'm unharmed.

181
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,933
(exhales)

182
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,536
(grunting in pain)
'Sup, wimp?

183
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:51,071
Detective, Detective,
I am so sorry.

184
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:53,006
You must have been
so worried in my absence.

185
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,241
Your absence? I saw
you two days ago.

186
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:56,710
I thought you were just avoiding
meeting the new lieutenant.

187
00:07:56,744 --> 00:07:58,546
New who? Never mind,
I don't care.

188
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:00,648
We've got something much more
important we need to discuss.

189
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:02,516
Oh, is this about
the message you left?

190
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,585
Message? Oh, right.

191
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:06,654
Uh, well, we will talk
about that later,

192
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:10,123
but right now we need
to figure out who kidnapped me.

193
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:11,659
Kidnapped you?

194
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:13,861
Okay, I'll play.
Who kidnapped you?

195
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:15,028
I don't know.

196
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:16,697
Well, what did they look like?

197
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,599
I don't know.

198
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:19,967
L-L-Look,

199
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,769
I'm fairly certain that
my Father's behind it.

200
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:23,671
Your father kidnapped you?

201
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:25,072
Well, no, not
Him personally.

202
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:27,207
God never gets His own
hands dirty, does He?

203
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,876
Uh-huh.

204
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:30,210
You don't believe me.

205
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:31,411
Uh-huh. Sorry.

206
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,914
This is just a little
far-fetched, even for you.
Right.

207
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:35,248
Okay, fine.
Mm-hmm.

208
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:37,150
I'll take you to the
scene of the crime.

209
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:38,652
Come on.
Come on!

210
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:41,689
* Shuffle, no stopping

211
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:44,592
* I dare you to knock me out

212
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:47,628
* Knock me out.

213
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:48,862
LUCIFER:
Yes, I'm sure.

214
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:50,864
It's just... past this shrub.

215
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:53,266
Well, I don't
see anything.

216
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,035
What? I...

217
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,606
Ah! Ha-ha! Footprints.

218
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:00,140
Those are mine.

219
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:01,609
Oh. Well...

220
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:03,744
well, then the wind
must have blown

221
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:05,245
the crime scene bare, Detective,

222
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:06,747
because I am not lying.

223
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,949
Someone kidnapped me.
I was outside the hospital,

224
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:10,751
leaving you a message,
and someone stashed me...

225
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:11,685
So this was
about that message.

226
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:13,086
Look, Lucifer,

227
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,723
if you regret what you said,
if this kidnapping tale

228
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:18,258
is some elaborate distraction,
you can just stop.

229
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,227
All right? You don't need
to tell me anything.

230
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,096
I'm no stranger
to the drunken dial.
Yes, I have been known

231
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,166
to avoid the issue at times,
but that is not the case here.

232
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:30,303
Detective, I swear, this is
the scene of a despicable crime.

233
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,007
What?

234
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,275
I...

235
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,577
I believe you.

236
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,355
*

237
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:58,766
ELLA: Soaked in sweat,
parched and starving,

238
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:02,002
he scraped, clawed his way
towards the light,

239
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:03,637
but, ironically,

240
00:10:03,671 --> 00:10:05,939
the only thing stronger
than his desperate desire

241
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:07,775
to live was...

242
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:09,643
the sun-- its relentless heat

243
00:10:09,677 --> 00:10:12,746
literally cooking him,
until one last...

244
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,281
breath...

245
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:15,983
(whispers):
and he's gone.

246
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:19,653
Tragic. But, now, can we
please get on with it?

247
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:21,221
Whoever killed this
dehydrated sap

248
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:23,657
is clearly responsible
for my devil-napping.

249
00:10:23,691 --> 00:10:25,959
I mean, the location's
far too coincidental.

250
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:27,327
Who is he, and
what does he

251
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,196
have to do with me?
CHLOE:
Steve Banales.

252
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:32,199
Owner and CEO
of Angelette Hotel.

253
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:34,167
Steve Banales.
That's strange.

254
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:35,669
Never heard of him.

255
00:10:35,703 --> 00:10:37,971
You'd think we'd have
some kind of connection.

256
00:10:38,005 --> 00:10:40,974
I suppose we'll get more answers
once we find our assailant.

257
00:10:41,008 --> 00:10:42,876
Hey, Jerry. I think
I found some footprints.

258
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:43,877
What?

259
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:45,846
No, those are mine.

260
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,314
(scoffs)
Amateurs.

261
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:49,817
How did we get stuck
with the "B" team, anyway?

262
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:50,818
Lucifer, this is

263
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:52,119
Lancaster PD.

264
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,887
The crime scene is
on the L.A. border,

265
00:10:53,921 --> 00:10:55,155
so they're here helping.

266
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:57,825
I mean, I think
they're doing a great job.

267
00:10:57,858 --> 00:10:59,727
Geez. These Lancaster guys
are a bunch of tools.

268
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:01,962
Oh.

269
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,697
DAN: Speaking of
tools, whoa, whoa.

270
00:11:03,731 --> 00:11:06,099
Whoa, hey, Detective? Detective?

271
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:08,168
So, what'd you find?
Looks like a key chain.

272
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:13,907
Hey, guys, look at this.

273
00:11:13,941 --> 00:11:15,876
Finally. A clue.

274
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:17,210
An "A"?

275
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:18,912
Right. Off we
go, Ms. Lopez.
Oh, uh,

276
00:11:18,946 --> 00:11:21,181
hold up, bud. I need to do
one more lap of the scene.

277
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:23,383
Want to make sure we
didn't miss anything.

278
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,352
I mean, not that I
don't trust Lancaster.

279
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:27,755
I just don't want to
disappoint our new lieutenant.

280
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:29,356
Oh, my gosh, you
guys, did I tell you

281
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:31,992
that I saw Lieutenant Pierce
speak at a conference last year?

282
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,994
"The Red Tape
Beyond the Yellow Tape."

283
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,328
Riveting.

284
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:36,730
Sounds it.
CHLOE:
Yeah, you told us.

285
00:11:36,764 --> 00:11:37,998
Yup, you did.

286
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,299
Anyway, big fan.

287
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:41,735
The guy is a
serious rock star.

288
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:43,436
I can't believe he
transferred here.

289
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,471
We are so lucky.

290
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:47,775
And I hear he's a total
sweetie pants to boot.

291
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:53,480
* This is our first glance
at the molecular shakedown *

292
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:59,286
* Once you put up your hands

293
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:04,424
* We throw all
of our weight around... *

294
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:06,159
I'm Lieutenant Marcus Pierce.

295
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:09,029
* I know you were made for me

296
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:12,099
* Yes, you were made for me...

297
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:13,834
All right, back to it.

298
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:20,073
Uh, Detective Daniel Espinoza.

299
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:21,541
Heard a lot about you,
Lieutenant,

300
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,111
and I'm really excited
to work with you.

301
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:26,814
I wish I could
say the same.

302
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:28,949
Aren't you that corrupt cop
that got off easy?

303
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:29,883
Excuse me?

304
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:32,185
No. Excuse me.

305
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:34,221
You must be Lucifer.

306
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:37,057
Morningstar.
Pleasure.

307
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,892
There was an investigation
last year.

308
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:42,495
We interviewed-- what was it--
92 of your sexual partners?

309
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:44,264
I think I'll refrain
from physical contact

310
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:45,833
if you don't mind.

311
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:47,067
(laughs)

312
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,136
You don't seem reckless.

313
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:52,906
Narcissistic,
hedonistic-- that I see.
Well, thank you very much.

314
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,108
Not a compliment. Your file
is as long as my Johnson.

315
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:56,409
Oh. Quick read then?

316
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,045
Hardly.
Well, I, for one,

317
00:12:58,078 --> 00:12:59,546
don't need a file to ascertain

318
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:02,082
you haven't even had a snog
in ages, have you?

319
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,951
Accurate.

320
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:04,818
Okay!

321
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:07,988
Hi. I am
Detective Decker.

322
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,890
Lucifer's partner. I know.

323
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:11,258
Actually, he's mine.

324
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,393
Uh, uh, consultant,
to be exact.

325
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:15,896
That's what I said.
But, uh...

326
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:17,998
Well?

327
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:19,099
Isn't he amazing?

328
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,834
We just had the
best conversation

329
00:13:20,868 --> 00:13:22,302
over the doughnuts
I brought for him...

330
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:25,138
everyone, not
just him. I'm not

331
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:26,406
kissing ass or anything.
DAN:
Mm-hmm.

332
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:28,876
Doughnuts for everyone!
Doughnuts!

333
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:29,843
Right.
Wow.

334
00:13:29,877 --> 00:13:32,079
Wow.
Lucifer.

335
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:34,581
I've been looking
all over for you.

336
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:35,916
(sighs)

337
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:38,585
Uh, through here. Go.

338
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,925
So what happened?

339
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,559
It was terrible, Brother.

340
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:47,961
I was kidnapped.

341
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:51,198
No, Luci. I meant Mom.

342
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,967
Ah. Well, didn't
you get my text?

343
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:57,504
What? You mean the string
of nonsensical emojis?

344
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:59,973
Fire, sword, doughnut, spaceman,

345
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:03,143
clock, dancing lady,
flashlight, thumbs up.

346
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,145
How am I supposed
to know what that means?

347
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,479
I ignited the
flaming sword,

348
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,515
used it to cut a hole
in space and time,

349
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:09,883
Mum's light
flooded through it,

350
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:11,885
then it closed up
behind her. All good!

351
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:18,892
Mom's... Mom is gone?

352
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:20,961
Yes.

353
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:22,963
Yes. I mean, she
says good-bye forever,

354
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:26,900
she loves you very much,
et cetera, et cetera, but

355
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:28,969
the good news is...

356
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:30,971
you get your necklace back.

357
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:33,573
And we all know how
attached to that you are.

358
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:36,443
So, back to more
current issues.

359
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:38,045
Me and my kidnapping.

360
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:39,947
Now, clearly Dad is behind it,

361
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,581
but the question is,
who's his emissary,

362
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:44,017
and how were they able
to render me unconscious?

363
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:46,086
Either they used some kind
of celestial weapon,

364
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,354
or the detective was nearby.

365
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,688
And if it's the latter,
then it has

366
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,958
to be someone who knows
she makes me vulnerable.

367
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,995
Hang on.

368
00:14:55,028 --> 00:15:00,067
The "A" on the key chain
is for Amenadiel, isn't it?

369
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,702
What?
Of course.

370
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,005
It's you!
Now that God's favorite son's

371
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:08,942
regained his powers, he's back
to being his little bitch.

372
00:15:08,976 --> 00:15:11,011
Luci,
I didn't get my powers back.

373
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:14,281
Yes, I was able
to slow time, but...

374
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:18,118
uh, that appears
to have been a one-time thing.

375
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:21,188
But... you have got
your wings back, huh?

376
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:22,722
No.

377
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,192
Not yet.

378
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:28,595
Well, isn't that ironic?

379
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:31,064
You want your wings back
and didn't get them, and...

380
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:34,601
I...

381
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:37,270
get whacked over the head
and hauled out to the desert.

382
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:39,506
That's not ironic.

383
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:40,673
Well, not ironic ironic.

384
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:42,275
More...
Alanis Morissette ironic.

385
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:43,977
Anyway, the point is,

386
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:46,246
I'm sure your full powers
will come back in no time.

387
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,115
You probably
just need... a good nap.

388
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:50,150
Or eat some mangos.
I've heard they work wonders.

389
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:52,152
What?
We got a suspect.

390
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:54,054
Prints on the key chain.

391
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:56,023
First, it looked like
it had been wiped down.

392
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:59,592
Then, I whipped out the color
fluorescent film, and whammo.

393
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:02,562
Well done,
Miss Lopez...
Mm-hmm.

394
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:04,297
Oh, sorry.
We haven't officially met yet.

395
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:05,698
I'm Ella.

396
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:09,136
Amenadiel.
I mean,

397
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:13,206
I've seen you around, doing your
handsome broody thing, but...

398
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:18,045
Anyway, any bro
of Lucifer's is a bro of mine.

399
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:21,114
Whoa.

400
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:23,550
Someone works out.

401
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:24,784
Now I know who carries

402
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,020
the guns in the family.
Right, yes.

403
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:29,722
Enough of that.
We have a suspect. Shall we?

404
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:31,058
Oh, Brother?

405
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:34,561
About your problem... Yeah.

406
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:36,663
I think I might have
just the remedy.

407
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:39,332
I'll text you the info later.

408
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:43,002
Words this time, please!

409
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:56,116
CHLOE: Josh Hamid,
the victim's business partner.

410
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:57,350
The two own this hotel.

411
00:16:57,384 --> 00:16:59,086
LUCIFER:
Well, this is a mug shot.

412
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:00,220
Has he got a record?

413
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:02,255
Yeah. Possession
of an exotic animal.

414
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:03,490
A tiger, I think.

415
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,125
Oh, that's
illegal? Too bad.

416
00:17:05,158 --> 00:17:06,025
Yeah, anyhow, looks like

417
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:08,195
Josh and Steve both come
from family money.

418
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:10,630
Basically bought this hotel
just to have a place to party.

419
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:12,632
Imagine, buying
your own establishment

420
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:15,068
just to justify your
decadent lifestyle.

421
00:17:15,102 --> 00:17:16,836
It's absurd.

422
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,072
Yeah. Absurd.

423
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:22,442
Thank you.

424
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:24,477
* You are our secret

425
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:26,213
* It's worth keeping *

426
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:29,249
* And now
I'm keeping my mouth shut *

427
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:30,783
* On the weekends

428
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:33,086
* I won't hang out
with anybody else... *

429
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,488
CHLOE:
Josh Hamid?

430
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:37,657
Who wants to know?

431
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,692
Detective Decker, LAPD.

432
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,128
I imagine you
recognize me.

433
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:45,698
You got a nice set of cans
for a cop.

434
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,167
(laughs)
Right.
Whilst I don't disagree,

435
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,501
that is incredibly
disrespectful.

436
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:50,170
Perhaps I should teach you
some manners.

437
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:52,239
Lucifer, I got this.

438
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,541
Got a nice ass, too.

439
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:57,110
Yeah? Well, I also got these,

440
00:17:57,144 --> 00:18:00,113
and your sorry ass is a suspect
in the Steve Banales murder.

441
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:03,116
(laughs) I told you
Steve was up to something.

442
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,517
You want to cuff me, honey?

443
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:06,386
You're gonna have to catch me.

444
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,121
LUCIFER:
Excuse me.

445
00:18:08,155 --> 00:18:09,622
(indistinct exclamations)

446
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:11,591
(woman gasps)

447
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:19,799
(laughs)

448
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:23,170
(laughing):
Oh, you've got a gun.

449
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:24,204
Scary.

450
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:27,174
Hey, you tell Steve
I am officially impressed.

451
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:29,209
You think this is funny?!

452
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:30,410
Lucifer!
(screams)

453
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:31,811
(water splashing)

454
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:34,214
(laughs)

455
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:36,783
Well, maybe
it's a bit funny.

456
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:56,236
So, Josh...

457
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:57,637
Why did you kidnap me?!

458
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,272
I swear, I've never seen you

459
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:01,274
before you tried
to kill me today!

460
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:02,742
Really, Joshy.

461
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:04,244
Excuse us.

462
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:08,415
What?

463
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:10,317
What are you doing?
Consulting.

464
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,718
Then consult less.

465
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:13,720
So you say you don't
recognize Lucifer,

466
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:16,689
but you do admit to knowing
Steve Banales, correct?

467
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:20,460
Then did you do this to him?

468
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,663
This is a joke, right?
(laughs)

469
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:25,432
We found this at
the crime scene

470
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:26,833
with your fingerprints
all over it.

471
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:29,369
I didn't kill Steve, man!
I would never!

472
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:32,405
That's the key I gave
to the fake kidnappers.

473
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:33,773
Fake?
Yeah.

474
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:35,708
They get paid to abduct people.

475
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:37,444
I hired them for Steve.

476
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:38,945
It's our thing.
CHLOE:
What?

477
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:41,981
To torture each other?
No! To pull pranks.

478
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,684
The more money we made,
the crazier the prank.

479
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:46,786
The fake kidnapping
was retaliation

480
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:50,357
for the tiger
Steve... put in my backyard.

481
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,325
What's the name
of the company?

482
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:53,493
Snatched.

483
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,262
Super under the radar.

484
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:56,763
I-I got the deluxe package.

485
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:58,498
Ah. Well, they delivered.

486
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,667
They were supposed
to nab Steve for 48 hours,

487
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,535
tie him up in a warehouse,

488
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:04,737
stick him in the desert,
and then drop him back

489
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:06,539
at the hotel.
When he didn't show,

490
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:09,942
I just assumed he was...
busy planning payback.

491
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:12,312
It's why I thought
you weren't real cops.

492
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:15,348
I mean, a guy named Lucifer and
the chick from Hot Tub Hotel?

493
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:17,584
High School.
Hot Tub High School.

494
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:18,918
She wasn't in the sequel.

495
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,254
I'm sorry.
Anyway, can you blame me?

496
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:23,756
Look, here's the
thing, Joshy.

497
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,792
I can assure you
we are quite real,

498
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:27,694
and by the looks of it,
so are your kidnappers,

499
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:30,430
so tell us what you know
about this Snatched.

500
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:33,733
*

501
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:39,572
(elevator bell dings)

502
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:41,708
All right, Luci,
I got your text.

503
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:44,911
What's this magical remedy
of yours?

504
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:46,879
*

505
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,785
Hi. I'm Remedy.

506
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:56,289
I'm here to rub you.

507
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:00,460
Uh, give you a massage.

508
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:02,462
Oh.

509
00:21:02,495 --> 00:21:03,730
(laughs)

510
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:07,934
Well, why not?

511
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:11,438
Lovely. Um, please
remove your clothing

512
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:13,005
and get under the towel.

513
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,442
We're gonna need a bigger towel.

514
00:21:17,344 --> 00:21:18,711
I know where they are.

515
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:21,013
I'll be right back.

516
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:49,776
(explosion)

517
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,512
(sighs) Oh, man.
I searched the IP address,

518
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:54,447
like, a zillion times
and it keeps pinging

519
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:56,383
to some random Russian server.

520
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:58,385
Surely there's some other way
to track these miscreants.

521
00:21:58,418 --> 00:22:00,387
Something we missed
at the crime scene perhaps?

522
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,355
I wish. All we found there
was that key chain

523
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:03,890
and our second victim.

524
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:06,526
Wait. Second victim?
Leo.

525
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,528
Once a vibrant rock squirrel.

526
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:11,698
Now... roadkill.

527
00:22:11,731 --> 00:22:13,533
Judging from his
time of death,

528
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:16,869
about 16 hours before
Steve died of dehydration.

529
00:22:16,903 --> 00:22:18,371
It's pretty likely
the kidnappers

530
00:22:18,405 --> 00:22:19,606
are the ones who
ran him over.
Mm-hmm.

531
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:21,508
Poor guy never even
saw it coming.

532
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:23,476
So, did you lift
any tire treads?

533
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,744
Sure did.

534
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:28,415
Leo was squashed by a
Ryuk Road Crusher tire.

535
00:22:28,448 --> 00:22:29,482
Commercial grade.

536
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:32,485
Only 850,000
sets produced.

537
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:33,720
In the world?
ELLA: Nope.

538
00:22:33,753 --> 00:22:35,822
In L.A.
Oh, for goodness' sakes.

539
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:40,593
You know, there
still is one angle

540
00:22:40,627 --> 00:22:42,529
that we haven't
quite explored yet.

541
00:22:42,562 --> 00:22:44,431
And that is your
connection to the case.

542
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:47,133
Oh, and I wasn't sure
you thought there was one.

543
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,569
Well, I'm still not sure I do,
but we're stuck,

544
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:53,940
so do you think your kidnapping
was intended as a prank?

545
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:55,508
Or to actually
hurt you, like Steve?

546
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:56,776
Definitely the latter.

547
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:58,511
My Father is not a jokester.

548
00:22:58,545 --> 00:23:00,112
Right.

549
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:01,981
Right. So, say
your father

550
00:23:02,014 --> 00:23:03,716
did hire
these fake kidnappers...

551
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,552
He did.
...to...

552
00:23:05,585 --> 00:23:08,054
Hmm.
Any idea why?

553
00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:10,557
Of course. He's angry that
I gave Mum her own universe.

554
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:13,993
I mean, nothing pisses God off
more than exercising free will.

555
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:16,463
I am trying to
believe you here.
Something horrid

556
00:23:16,496 --> 00:23:19,031
happened to me and I woke up
in the desert with my bloody...

557
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:20,467
wi...

558
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,501
What?

559
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:26,138
Okay, Detective.
I understand your confusion.

560
00:23:26,172 --> 00:23:28,074
And, although I've told you
the truth from the beginning,

561
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:29,609
you're a woman
of logic and reason.

562
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:33,613
And... that-that is why
I left you that message.

563
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:36,015
You require proof.

564
00:23:36,048 --> 00:23:38,885
And I suppose now is as good a
time as any to give it to you.

565
00:23:41,688 --> 00:23:43,456
So perhaps you should sit.

566
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:45,458
Okay.

567
00:23:45,492 --> 00:23:47,560
Mm-hmm.

568
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,902
Oh, right.

569
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:58,471
Yeah. Maybe I
should... leave.

570
00:23:58,505 --> 00:24:01,007
You know, uh, third wheel.

571
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,175
Watch out.
(whistles)

572
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:07,680
(sighs)

573
00:24:07,714 --> 00:24:09,115
Okay.

574
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:10,983
Lucifer, just show me what
you need to show me.

575
00:24:11,017 --> 00:24:12,785
You know, I don't need
anything to drink.

576
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:14,887
Well, I do.

577
00:24:17,156 --> 00:24:20,993
I have tried to be
honest with you,

578
00:24:21,027 --> 00:24:23,763
but if I'm being honest
with myself,

579
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:26,599
and I have held the
real truth back from you,

580
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:29,235
and you, of all people,
deserve to know that, Detective.

581
00:24:31,671 --> 00:24:33,239
Which is why I want to show you.

582
00:24:33,272 --> 00:24:34,707
(inhales)

583
00:24:34,741 --> 00:24:36,576
Lucifer, whatever it is

584
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:38,778
that you want to show me

585
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:42,915
or that you want to tell me,
it's okay.

586
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:45,017
I'm here for you.

587
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:47,620
Okay.

588
00:24:48,855 --> 00:24:51,023
Then, once and for all,

589
00:24:51,057 --> 00:24:53,693
I'd like to show you
who I really am.

590
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:56,529
(quietly):
Okay.

591
00:24:57,664 --> 00:24:59,198
You ready?

592
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:03,102
Yeah.

593
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:10,810
(grunting)

594
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,815
(exhaling)

595
00:25:17,717 --> 00:25:21,320
Oh, my God. What?
Are you gassy?

596
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,289
(grunting)

597
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:25,758
Why is it not working?

598
00:25:25,792 --> 00:25:26,959
Why isn't what working?

599
00:25:26,993 --> 00:25:29,596
What? I don't understand.

600
00:25:29,629 --> 00:25:30,997
(growls)
I do.

601
00:25:31,931 --> 00:25:33,900
You know, I keep caring,

602
00:25:33,933 --> 00:25:37,236
and you... you just...

603
00:25:38,838 --> 00:25:40,006
Just...

604
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,174
No, Detective! I...

605
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:46,045
I...

606
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:48,214
really am the Devil.

607
00:25:54,954 --> 00:25:57,256
Well, that sucks.

608
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,626
Dead ends piss me off.

609
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:02,461
Which is why
I don't believe in them.

610
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:05,031
Now, these kidnappers might be
fake but they're not invisible.

611
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,599
There has to be a way
to find them.

612
00:26:06,633 --> 00:26:07,800
CHLOE:
You're right.

613
00:26:07,834 --> 00:26:09,235
If Muhammad won't
come to the mountain,

614
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:10,703
the mountain must
go to Muhammad.

615
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:12,672
I have no idea what that means,
Decker.

616
00:26:12,705 --> 00:26:13,873
Well, someone needs
to get kidnapped.

617
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:15,174
Now, there's an idea.

618
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:16,375
That I was just suggesting.

619
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,777
No one likes a credit hog,
Decker.

620
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:18,945
Now, who would be the bait?

621
00:26:18,978 --> 00:26:20,212
Well, I'd like to volunteer.

622
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:21,781
CHLOE:
Uh, it's not a good idea.

623
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:23,315
If these are the same
guys that abducted,

624
00:26:23,349 --> 00:26:25,284
allegedly, Lucifer, they're
gonna recognize him.

625
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:28,054
Right. We need somebody
who's a lot less, well...

626
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,689
everything.

627
00:26:29,722 --> 00:26:30,923
Esperanza.

628
00:26:30,957 --> 00:26:32,725
Es-Espinoza.

629
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:35,061
And, sure, that makes,
uh, makes sense.

630
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,929
I have the most experience
in the field,

631
00:26:36,963 --> 00:26:38,064
so if something
goes wrong, then...

632
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:39,331
You're expendable.

633
00:26:39,365 --> 00:26:40,667
Exactly.

634
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,801
Thank you.

635
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:45,638
Now go get kidnapped,
Esperanza.

636
00:26:45,672 --> 00:26:47,774
* I'm telling everybody
charge up the power *

637
00:26:47,807 --> 00:26:52,211
* The lights go out
in the midnight hour... *

638
00:26:52,244 --> 00:26:54,814
Hey, excuse me, I was wondering
if I could get a...

639
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:55,748
We're closed.

640
00:26:55,782 --> 00:26:57,650
We ran out of meat.

641
00:26:57,684 --> 00:26:58,985
All right, Daniel.

642
00:26:59,018 --> 00:27:00,753
You're not allergic to gerbils,
are you?

643
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:02,121
Just making some
last-minute adjustments

644
00:27:02,154 --> 00:27:04,023
to the questionnaire.

645
00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:05,391
Hilarious.

646
00:27:05,424 --> 00:27:07,760
Hey, Lucifer, did you
set up the pickup point?

647
00:27:07,794 --> 00:27:08,861
Yes. Tour bus pickup.

648
00:27:08,895 --> 00:27:10,062
Olvera Street.

649
00:27:10,096 --> 00:27:11,798
Exactly one half hour
from now.

650
00:27:11,831 --> 00:27:13,399
All right, good.

651
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:16,769
Hey. You know the team

652
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:18,938
will intervene before
anyone gets hurt, yeah?

653
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:21,007
Yeah.

654
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,342
Okay.

655
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:25,044
Look, if you're upset about
what the lieutenant said,

656
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:26,245
you're not alone.

657
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:27,980
He's not a fan
of mine, either.

658
00:27:28,014 --> 00:27:30,216
And I still can't believe he
called me "Lucifer's partner."

659
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:31,818
You are my partner!

660
00:27:31,851 --> 00:27:33,419
(sighs)

661
00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:35,755
You know, the truth is,
I am feeling expendable.

662
00:27:35,788 --> 00:27:37,690
Why?
It's not because
Pierce said it.

663
00:27:37,724 --> 00:27:39,759
It's because of Charlotte.

664
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:41,393
Oh.

665
00:27:41,427 --> 00:27:43,329
Yeah, after everything
that happened at the beach,

666
00:27:43,362 --> 00:27:45,698
she's acting like she
doesn't even know me.

667
00:27:45,732 --> 00:27:47,800
I'm not an idiot, I know
she was using me at first,

668
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:51,103
but... but then it seemed
like she actually cared.

669
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:54,206
Well, um...
Whatever.

670
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,775
I'll get over it.

671
00:27:55,808 --> 00:27:57,009
I'm sorry, Dan.

672
00:27:57,043 --> 00:27:58,811
Yes, I'm sorry,
too, Daniel,

673
00:27:58,845 --> 00:28:00,747
that I can't hear you.
Could you speak up, please?

674
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,815
PIERCE (over radio):
T minus 20, people.

675
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:04,717
Take your mark, Espinoza.

676
00:28:04,751 --> 00:28:06,719
Right, I'll check in with
McMillian at the lookout point.

677
00:28:06,753 --> 00:28:08,120
Okay.

678
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:13,793
Uh, Daniel.

679
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:17,496
Listen, uh...
Come on.

680
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,732
Oh, right.
Undercover, yes.

681
00:28:19,766 --> 00:28:22,201
Listen, I know you were
talking about Charlotte.

682
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:25,905
And as douchey as you may be,
and I know you can't help it,

683
00:28:25,938 --> 00:28:28,875
her current behavior has
nothing to do with you, okay?

684
00:28:28,908 --> 00:28:30,442
And as much as I
appreciate the pep talk,

685
00:28:30,476 --> 00:28:32,444
Lucifer, it was kinda
you that got me

686
00:28:32,478 --> 00:28:34,346
in the whole Charlotte mess
in the first place.

687
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,048
So maybe you should just

688
00:28:36,082 --> 00:28:39,218
take care of your side of the
street for a change, all right?

689
00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:41,087
Good talk.

690
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,323
My side of the street.

691
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:46,859
That's a good idea.

692
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:55,968
(quiet knocking on door)

693
00:28:56,002 --> 00:28:58,337
Leo?

694
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,506
(knocking on door)

695
00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:04,743
Oh.

696
00:29:06,112 --> 00:29:08,214
Hey. I'm sorry to bother you,

697
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,316
but do you have any idea
where my brother went?

698
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:12,051
He's ignoring
my phone calls.

699
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:14,854
Oh, bud, no, no, no.
He's totally not ignoring you.

700
00:29:14,887 --> 00:29:17,957
He's just in the middle
of this sting operation.

701
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,225
Oh.

702
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:20,927
Can I help?

703
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,129
That's very nice of you, but no.

704
00:29:23,162 --> 00:29:25,231
It's personal.

705
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:31,537
You a believer?

706
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:34,807
Well, then, whatever it is
you're going through,

707
00:29:34,841 --> 00:29:37,877
I'm sure it's all part
of His plan.

708
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,478
I mean, even the most

709
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:43,115
pathetic, sad sack, powerless of
creatures serve a purpose.

710
00:29:43,149 --> 00:29:45,852
Like Leo here.

711
00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:51,557
A van may have cracked his nuts
in the middle of the desert,

712
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:54,593
but he's still
valuable evidence.

713
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,929
That's the thing.
You never know

714
00:29:56,963 --> 00:29:59,565
when your rock-bottom pain
and humiliation

715
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:01,533
can end up helping others.

716
00:30:01,567 --> 00:30:04,070
I mean, God works
in mysterious ways.

717
00:30:04,103 --> 00:30:07,239
So you just got to believe
that when He crushes your nuts,

718
00:30:07,273 --> 00:30:09,141
He does it for a reason.

719
00:30:09,175 --> 00:30:10,409
Has this, um,

720
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:14,380
Leo provided you with
a break in your case?

721
00:30:15,214 --> 00:30:17,249
Not yet.

722
00:30:17,283 --> 00:30:20,152
But you got
to have faith, right?

723
00:30:20,186 --> 00:30:24,991
Right. Right.

724
00:30:28,928 --> 00:30:30,863
The kidnappers
are seven minutes late.

725
00:30:30,897 --> 00:30:33,365
Yeah, well, we didn't give them
a lot of prep time; don't worry.

726
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:35,034
I'm worried.

727
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:36,135
Where are they?

728
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:38,370
They'll be here.

729
00:30:38,404 --> 00:30:39,906
(quietly):
Come on.

730
00:30:39,939 --> 00:30:42,408
Come on, be here. Be here.

731
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:44,944
(tires screech)

732
00:30:47,947 --> 00:30:50,516
Oh, lovely.
Right on time.

733
00:30:52,418 --> 00:30:53,920
Hello. Right. How do we do...

734
00:30:53,953 --> 00:30:56,155
Oh, careful. I bruise
like a peach.

735
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:57,156
(grunts)

736
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:58,991
Easy.

737
00:31:02,228 --> 00:31:04,363
(phone buzzes)

738
00:31:11,037 --> 00:31:12,905
Seriously?

739
00:31:20,446 --> 00:31:22,548
(water dripping)

740
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:22,915
LUCIFER:
Ah, there you are.

741
00:31:26,052 --> 00:31:28,955
I have to say, the leaky pipe
is a nice touch.

742
00:31:28,988 --> 00:31:31,257
Very Blood Simple.

743
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:33,192
Coen Brothers movie?

744
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,061
No?

745
00:31:35,094 --> 00:31:37,063
Oh.

746
00:31:37,096 --> 00:31:38,430
Well,

747
00:31:38,464 --> 00:31:40,366
hello, kidnappers.

748
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:44,103
Finally, I have you
right where I want you.

749
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:46,172
(both chuckle)

750
00:31:46,205 --> 00:31:48,140
(chuckles)

751
00:31:48,174 --> 00:31:50,309
Let's see,
so many questions,

752
00:31:50,342 --> 00:31:53,045
but let's start with: how did
you abduct me the first time?

753
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:55,414
Hmm? How did you
render me unconscious?

754
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:57,449
(laughing):
Ow. What are you doing?

755
00:31:57,483 --> 00:31:58,917
Stop it, that tickles.

756
00:32:00,452 --> 00:32:01,420
(grunts)

757
00:32:04,123 --> 00:32:05,324
We used this
last week, right?

758
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:06,325
Yeah.

759
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:08,694
Did you forget
to charge it?

760
00:32:08,727 --> 00:32:10,629
No. I didn't forget
to charge it.

761
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:12,631
(high-pitched scream)
Dude.

762
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:14,333
Not cool.
I just don't get it.

763
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:16,102
I don't know.
I hate to interrupt.

764
00:32:16,135 --> 00:32:17,269
(both gasp)

765
00:32:17,303 --> 00:32:18,270
(clears throat)

766
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:21,040
Where were we?

767
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:26,212
Remind me not to leave Lucifer
in the front seat unattended.

768
00:32:26,245 --> 00:32:28,014
And remind me
to kick his ass

769
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:29,215
for humiliating me
in front of Pierce.

770
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:31,150
Well, I'll help you
if we can find him.

771
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:32,451
Look...

772
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:33,986
don't worry, Chloe.

773
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,554
Lucifer can take
care of himself.

774
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:37,289
Found Lucifer's phone...

775
00:32:37,323 --> 00:32:39,058
in some bushes
on Alameda Street.

776
00:32:39,091 --> 00:32:40,726
Kidnappers must have
tossed it.

777
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:41,627
What about, uh, traffic cams?

778
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,595
Maybe we can pull
a plate number.
No.

779
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:46,132
I checked everything
within a mile radius. Nada.

780
00:32:46,165 --> 00:32:48,134
Must have grabbed him
in a blind spot.

781
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:49,301
Unfortunately,

782
00:32:49,335 --> 00:32:51,470
I think we're dealing with
some pretty crafty bad guys.

783
00:32:51,503 --> 00:32:52,604
MAN:
I...

784
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:54,240
can't... breathe!

785
00:32:54,273 --> 00:32:56,175
(groaning,
crying)

786
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:59,078
Please don't crush him.
We've only just begun.

787
00:32:59,111 --> 00:33:01,780
No. Come on, man.
Ask us anything!

788
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,182
(cries)

789
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:04,683
All right.

790
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:07,053
My face--
how did you do it?

791
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:09,021
What?!
Well, the wings
are one thing,

792
00:33:09,055 --> 00:33:12,191
but my Devil face--
how did you take that?

793
00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:14,393
We've never seen
you before, man!

794
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:15,761
Yeah, man.

795
00:33:15,794 --> 00:33:16,862
Never heard of you before today.

796
00:33:16,895 --> 00:33:20,499
I just got a name--
Daniel LaDoosh-- a pickup point,

797
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:22,768
and that you got a thing
for gerbils.

798
00:33:22,801 --> 00:33:25,337
(crying)
I suppose you also deny
abducting Mr. Banales

799
00:33:25,371 --> 00:33:28,040
and leaving him to perish
in the desert, do you?

800
00:33:28,074 --> 00:33:30,042
He's the client
from last week, man!

801
00:33:30,076 --> 00:33:31,410
Right, man.

802
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:33,145
His friend got him
the deluxe package.

803
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:35,147
We did the
detail work here,

804
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:36,415
and then our partner Sam
picked him up,

805
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:38,284
took him to the spider hole
for a few hours,

806
00:33:38,317 --> 00:33:40,386
and dropped him
back off at the hotel.
Well, then,

807
00:33:40,419 --> 00:33:42,188
it seems
your colleague took a detour.

808
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:43,555
Where does this Sam live?

809
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:44,656
Koreatown!

810
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,125
It's a pink building on Leeward.

811
00:33:46,158 --> 00:33:50,062
Apartment?
5B, man! 5B!

812
00:33:50,096 --> 00:33:52,398
Lovely. Thanks for your help.

813
00:33:52,431 --> 00:33:53,199
Hey, man!

814
00:33:53,232 --> 00:33:55,234
(crying)
Will you let
us go, man?

815
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:57,369
(both scream)

816
00:33:57,403 --> 00:33:59,671
ELLA:
So, prints off the
key chain led to Josh.

817
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:02,474
CHLOE:
Right. Tire treads
on the roadkill led to nothing.

818
00:34:02,508 --> 00:34:04,610
There's got to be
something we're missing.

819
00:34:04,643 --> 00:34:06,145
Maybe Lancaster has something.

820
00:34:06,178 --> 00:34:07,613
We're screwed.

821
00:34:07,646 --> 00:34:09,181
Or not.

822
00:34:09,215 --> 00:34:10,782
Remember the detective
who found the key chain?

823
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:13,252
He doesn't exist, at least
not at Lancaster PD.

824
00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:15,121
They only sent patrol
units to the scene.

825
00:34:15,154 --> 00:34:17,089
Whoa. You think
that was our guy?

826
00:34:17,123 --> 00:34:19,258
Killers often return to
the scene of the crime.

827
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:19,958
DAN:
Which means

828
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:21,227
he wasn't finding evidence.

829
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,528
He was trying to steal it.

830
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:23,795
Should have known.

831
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:25,397
Why should you have known?

832
00:34:25,431 --> 00:34:27,333
Lancaster doesn't know us,
we don't know them.

833
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:29,101
Look, let's just look through
these photos, try and find him

834
00:34:29,135 --> 00:34:31,170
in the background, okay?
Yes, and then we
can nail his ass

835
00:34:31,203 --> 00:34:33,105
with facial
recognition software.

836
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:35,707
Here he is.

837
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:37,643
But his back's to us.

838
00:34:37,676 --> 00:34:40,246
You guys... oh, my gosh.

839
00:34:40,279 --> 00:34:42,548
I knew... I knew
he didn't die in vain.

840
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,750
What?
Who?

841
00:34:44,783 --> 00:34:47,153
Leo. See, look.

842
00:34:47,186 --> 00:34:49,621
There's our suspect,
right, leaving the scene,

843
00:34:49,655 --> 00:34:51,823
walking towards that van.

844
00:34:51,857 --> 00:34:54,260
Ryuk Road Crusher tires.

845
00:34:54,293 --> 00:34:55,361
Commercial grade.

846
00:34:55,394 --> 00:34:57,363
That's the van
that ran over Leo.

847
00:34:57,396 --> 00:34:59,231
I mean, this
pretty much confirms

848
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:01,133
that this guy's
our killer.
CHLOE:
Okay.

849
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:02,334
So maybe we can
get an ID.

850
00:35:02,368 --> 00:35:04,536
Let's run
the license plate.

851
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:11,710
(knocking)

852
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:37,203
Remember me?

853
00:35:42,241 --> 00:35:44,410
It's you.

854
00:35:44,443 --> 00:35:45,644
Yes.

855
00:35:45,677 --> 00:35:48,380
You know me as the Devil you so
rudely turned into an angel

856
00:35:48,414 --> 00:35:49,715
and then dumped
in the middle of the desert,

857
00:35:49,748 --> 00:35:51,650
but I don't know you,
so, come on,

858
00:35:51,683 --> 00:35:52,951
introduce yourself.

859
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,453
I'm Sam.
Yes, yes,

860
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:56,222
I know that, but what are you?

861
00:35:56,255 --> 00:35:58,257
And how did my Father
get his hooks into you?

862
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,358
Your father?

863
00:35:59,391 --> 00:36:01,260
Oh, come on,
don't be coy.

864
00:36:01,293 --> 00:36:02,594
Let me see.

865
00:36:02,628 --> 00:36:05,197
Unless Dad got jiggy
with some celestial babe

866
00:36:05,231 --> 00:36:07,333
after Mum, then
you're not my sibling,

867
00:36:07,366 --> 00:36:09,568
so... demon. Hmm?

868
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:10,502
Changeling?

869
00:36:10,536 --> 00:36:13,672
I work for
an extreme kidnapping company.

870
00:36:13,705 --> 00:36:14,540
Snatched.

871
00:36:14,573 --> 00:36:16,308
Oh, do you now?
Well, do you know what?

872
00:36:16,342 --> 00:36:17,576
It doesn't matter
what you are because...

873
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:19,278
this should take care of you.

874
00:36:19,311 --> 00:36:20,379
Whoa! Whoa!

875
00:36:20,412 --> 00:36:22,214
Whoa! I-- I'm sorry.

876
00:36:22,248 --> 00:36:24,650
I'm sorry I left you
in the desert.

877
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:26,452
I really am.

878
00:36:26,485 --> 00:36:28,854
And I'm sorry I left
that Steve guy there, too.

879
00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:30,556
I-- He was just a routine gig.

880
00:36:30,589 --> 00:36:31,790
I was gonna swap him for you,

881
00:36:31,823 --> 00:36:33,692
but when I went to
pull you out of the van,

882
00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:37,963
you... you had
friggin' wings, man!

883
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:39,965
Well, duh!
Wings that you put there

884
00:36:39,998 --> 00:36:41,367
at the behest of my Father!

885
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,369
Now stop lying!
I'm not!

886
00:36:43,402 --> 00:36:45,637
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.

887
00:36:45,671 --> 00:36:46,538
I swear.

888
00:36:46,572 --> 00:36:48,440
And believe me,
I didn't want to run,

889
00:36:48,474 --> 00:36:50,242
but you scared
the hell out of me.

890
00:36:50,276 --> 00:36:51,343
Right, you listen, Sammy,

891
00:36:51,377 --> 00:36:52,878
I know you're
just the messenger,

892
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:55,814
so why don't you deliver
a message on my behalf?

893
00:36:57,383 --> 00:37:01,653
I define who I am, not Him.

894
00:37:01,687 --> 00:37:02,821
Me!

895
00:37:02,854 --> 00:37:04,723
(cries)

896
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:08,327
Oh, bloody hell.

897
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,396
They're back, aren't they?

898
00:37:10,429 --> 00:37:11,897
How?
(whoosh)

899
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,432
How are you doing this?

900
00:37:13,465 --> 00:37:15,434
Did my Father
give you some kind of totem?

901
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:16,602
A talisman?

902
00:37:16,635 --> 00:37:18,437
What?
I'm telling you, I don't...

903
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,572
I don't know what's happening.

904
00:37:20,606 --> 00:37:22,541
And I don't know your dad.

905
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:26,545
Unless, is your,
is your dad the Sinnerman?

906
00:37:28,447 --> 00:37:30,949
Quite the opposite.
Who's the Sinnerman?

907
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:31,950
That's, that's who,

908
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:33,819
who hired me to kidnap you.

909
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:37,389
He's, he's, he's a scary dude.

910
00:37:37,423 --> 00:37:39,825
Huge crime boss.
I owed him big time.

911
00:37:39,858 --> 00:37:41,793
But because I didn't
finish the job,

912
00:37:41,827 --> 00:37:42,994
I'm as good as dead now.

913
00:37:43,028 --> 00:37:44,396
That's why I was running.

914
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:46,365
And where do I find
this Sinnerman?

915
00:37:46,398 --> 00:37:47,766
You don't.

916
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:49,301
He finds you.

917
00:37:49,335 --> 00:37:50,502
CHLOE:
Lucifer?

918
00:37:53,405 --> 00:37:54,740
Get up.

919
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:55,841
Up.

920
00:37:55,874 --> 00:37:58,510
Come on, get up.

921
00:37:58,544 --> 00:38:00,712
Put your hands
behind your back.

922
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,317
What happened to you?
I...

923
00:38:07,853 --> 00:38:09,621
I don't know.

924
00:38:20,866 --> 00:38:23,001
Decker, it ain't good.

925
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:25,404
Lieutenant, look, I-I know
what you're gonna say.

926
00:38:25,437 --> 00:38:26,805
And, even though
we caught our guy,

927
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:29,941
Lucifer was way out of line,
and I-I don't disagree,

928
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:31,543
but here's what
you got to know

929
00:38:31,577 --> 00:38:33,345
about our unorthodox methods...

930
00:38:33,379 --> 00:38:34,713
Detective, you...
I am Lucifer's partner,

931
00:38:34,746 --> 00:38:37,983
yes, you're right,
but you know what?

932
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:39,551
He's mine, too.

933
00:38:39,585 --> 00:38:42,688
And, for whatever reason,
we make an effective team.

934
00:38:42,721 --> 00:38:46,458
And will be even more so
when I stop investing

935
00:38:46,492 --> 00:38:50,061
on a, um... personal level.

936
00:38:50,095 --> 00:38:51,963
I am here to solve crimes.

937
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:54,566
Not to see his... his thing

938
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,402
or whatever, which is...

939
00:38:56,435 --> 00:38:59,971
not something
that you need to know.

940
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:01,206
Right. Look, point is,

941
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:04,643
you can say what you want,
but I know I'm a good detective

942
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:07,045
and I have a damn good
solve rate to prove that.

943
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:08,780
Okay.

944
00:39:10,882 --> 00:39:11,917
Okay.

945
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,419
Okay.

946
00:39:13,452 --> 00:39:15,554
I just came down here

947
00:39:15,587 --> 00:39:17,956
to let you know that your perp
has been released on bail.

948
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:19,124
Oh.

949
00:39:19,157 --> 00:39:20,992
W-Wait, how is that possible?

950
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:22,027
Don't know.

951
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,429
Friends in high places, I guess.

952
00:39:23,462 --> 00:39:24,596
But there's got to be something.

953
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,465
I mean, don't-don't you care?

954
00:39:26,498 --> 00:39:27,966
You do what you can, Decker.

955
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:29,635
You can't save them all.

956
00:39:29,668 --> 00:39:31,002
Oh.

957
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:34,406
But, um, good luck
with Lucifer's... thing

958
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,874
or whatever.

959
00:39:53,525 --> 00:39:55,461
(elevator bell dings)

960
00:39:59,531 --> 00:40:02,601
Oh, hello, Brother.

961
00:40:02,634 --> 00:40:04,603
So, did Remedy cure
what ails you?

962
00:40:04,636 --> 00:40:06,171
Did her massage
make anything

963
00:40:06,204 --> 00:40:07,038
pop out?

964
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:08,674
Talking about your wings,
of course.

965
00:40:08,707 --> 00:40:12,578
No, mine are still absent.

966
00:40:12,611 --> 00:40:14,480
But yours, on the other hand...

967
00:40:16,682 --> 00:40:19,184
(softly):
Oh.

968
00:40:19,217 --> 00:40:20,586
Lucifer, I'm not angry with you

969
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:22,721
that you somehow
got your wings back,

970
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:24,456
or even that you
cut them off again,

971
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:28,193
as foul as that may be.

972
00:40:28,226 --> 00:40:30,529
I'm angry with myself.

973
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:33,599
Because somehow I made you feel

974
00:40:33,632 --> 00:40:35,634
like you couldn't confide in me.

975
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:38,770
Well, comparing body parts
is never good for the male ego,

976
00:40:38,804 --> 00:40:40,672
especially between brothers.

977
00:40:40,706 --> 00:40:43,742
But that's just it, Luci.

978
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:47,145
My ego should never be an issue.

979
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:50,215
I am an angel.

980
00:40:50,248 --> 00:40:51,583
A soldier of God.

981
00:40:51,617 --> 00:40:53,885
His favorite son.

982
00:40:53,919 --> 00:40:56,054
Oh, that's gonna be a thing,
isn't it?

983
00:40:56,087 --> 00:40:59,124
(stifled laugh)

984
00:40:59,157 --> 00:41:02,127
Listen, Father, He...

985
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,763
works in mysterious ways.

986
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:07,766
I was tested once and I failed.

987
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:09,801
I'm not gonna fail again.

988
00:41:09,835 --> 00:41:12,070
Because this time, I have faith.

989
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:15,674
Excellent.

990
00:41:15,707 --> 00:41:18,243
And I suppose
this won't bother you.

991
00:41:18,276 --> 00:41:20,746
(whoosh)

992
00:41:23,715 --> 00:41:25,984
But you...

993
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:27,218
you cut them off.

994
00:41:27,252 --> 00:41:30,556
I did, but the pesky things
seem to be a bit more tenacious

995
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:32,624
this time around.

996
00:41:32,658 --> 00:41:34,960
Well, like I said, I have faith.

997
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:37,295
I'm sure it's all
a part of God's plan.

998
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,296
(laughing):
Yes!

999
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,599
If you mean his plan
to continually manipulate

1000
00:41:40,632 --> 00:41:42,701
and control me, then agreed.

1001
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:44,603
Because, by the way,

1002
00:41:44,636 --> 00:41:46,905
he didn't just
give my wings back,

1003
00:41:46,938 --> 00:41:48,907
he took my Devil face as well.

1004
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:53,078
Luci, do you realize
what this means?

1005
00:41:53,111 --> 00:41:56,214
Perhaps Father is trying
to show you that,

1006
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:57,549
that you've been forgiven.

1007
00:41:57,583 --> 00:41:59,885
What if I don't want
His forgiveness?

1008
00:41:59,918 --> 00:42:03,622
But, Brother,
if you can be redeemed,

1009
00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:05,090
that means that anyone can.

1010
00:42:06,758 --> 00:42:09,561
Now, isn't that divine?

1011
00:42:09,595 --> 00:42:12,097
(scoffs)

1012
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:16,034
I'm not sure that
this is divinity at work here.

1013
00:42:16,067 --> 00:42:19,605
(sighs)

1014
00:42:19,638 --> 00:42:23,675
Have you ever heard
of someone named the Sinnerman?

1015
00:42:24,776 --> 00:42:26,177
The Sinnerman?

1016
00:42:29,715 --> 00:42:31,216
No.

1017
00:42:31,249 --> 00:42:33,685
Why?

1018
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,656
That's who kidnapped me.

1019
00:42:48,634 --> 00:42:49,635
At first, I thought it was a...

1020
00:42:49,668 --> 00:42:51,336
an emissary on Earth

1021
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:53,304
working on Dad's behalf, but
then, the more I think about it,

1022
00:42:53,338 --> 00:42:55,306
the more I think...

1023
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:59,577
maybe this isn't our Father
who art in Heaven at all.

1024
00:43:05,651 --> 00:43:06,618
But something much,

1025
00:43:06,652 --> 00:43:09,988
much darker.
