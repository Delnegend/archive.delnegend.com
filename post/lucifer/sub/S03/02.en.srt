1
00:00:01,202 --> 00:00:02,436
Previously on Lucifer...

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:04,138
We need to figure out
who kidnapped me.

3
00:00:04,172 --> 00:00:05,739
I'm fairly certain that
my Father's behind it.

4
00:00:05,773 --> 00:00:06,807
AMENADIEL: Lucifer,
I'm not angry with you,

5
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,841
that you somehow
got your wings back,

6
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:10,578
or even that
you cut them off again.

7
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:12,413
I was tested once,
and I failed.

8
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:13,614
I'm not gonna fail again.

9
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:16,016
I suppose this won't bother you.

10
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:17,618
But you cut them off.

11
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:18,752
The pesky things seem to be

12
00:00:18,786 --> 00:00:20,654
a bit more tenacious
this time around.

13
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:22,156
I'm Lieutenant Marcus Pierce.

14
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,624
DAN: Heard a lot about
you, Lieutenant,

15
00:00:23,657 --> 00:00:25,226
and I'm really excited
to work with you.

16
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:27,095
Aren't you that corrupt
cop that got off easy?

17
00:00:27,128 --> 00:00:27,961
Excuse me?

18
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:28,929
People come to me
to ask for favors,

19
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:31,165
and more often than not,
I'm happy to oblige.

20
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,300
What do you get?

21
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,568
Simply to be repaid
at a later date.

22
00:00:34,602 --> 00:00:37,405
A devilish IOU, if you will.

23
00:00:37,438 --> 00:00:39,573
LUCIFER:
Who's the Sinnerman?

24
00:00:39,607 --> 00:00:41,175
That's who hired me
to kidnap you.

25
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:43,511
He's a scary dude.
Huge crime boss.

26
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:44,645
And where do I find him?

27
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:47,815
SAM:
You don't. He finds you.

28
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,319
*

29
00:00:51,352 --> 00:00:54,288
* Down, down, d-down, down
* Are you? *

30
00:00:57,158 --> 00:00:59,760
* Down, down, d-d-down,
down, down, down *

31
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:02,230
* Are you down, are you down,
are you d-d-down? *

32
00:01:02,263 --> 00:01:05,199
* Are you down, are you
down, are you d-d-d-d-down? *

33
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:06,867
* Are you...

34
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,636
This way.

35
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:10,704
(vocalizing)

36
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:12,806
* Down

37
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,708
* Are you, are you

38
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:17,245
* D-D-D-D-Down, are you...

39
00:01:17,278 --> 00:01:18,646
(vocalizing)

40
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:20,248
Ah...

41
00:01:21,782 --> 00:01:24,252
(sighs)
You're an angel.

42
00:01:24,285 --> 00:01:25,653
(Lucifer sighs)

43
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:27,221
Oh, gosh.

44
00:01:27,255 --> 00:01:28,189
Uh, my apologies.

45
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:30,391
And for the record,
I don't usually suffer

46
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:32,826
from premature unfurling.

47
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,395
(grunts, chuckles)

48
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:37,131
Right.
Now, where were we?

49
00:01:37,165 --> 00:01:39,333
No, keep them out.

50
00:01:39,367 --> 00:01:42,403
I'm totally into cosplay.

51
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:45,539
I could dress up as a devil
and make it really sexy.

52
00:01:45,573 --> 00:01:50,211
I have no desire
to have sex with myself.

53
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:52,513
Not right now, at least.

54
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:53,847
Where are you going?

55
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:56,250
To do some grooming.

56
00:01:56,284 --> 00:01:59,320
(sighs)

57
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:00,721
I'd recommend you leave. Now.

58
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:04,192
I'm about to engage
in a rather gruesome form

59
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:05,459
of manscaping.

60
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:06,894
LINDA:
You cut them off, didn't you?

61
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:09,230
I did, yes.

62
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:11,365
But then they grew back,
so I cut them off again.

63
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:12,866
It's like whack-a-mole
back there.

64
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,468
(chuckles)

65
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:15,869
I'm worried about you.

66
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:19,407
What you're describing
is self-mutilation.

67
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,210
Doctor, someone is
forcing those wings on me.

68
00:02:22,243 --> 00:02:24,245
They took away my devil face.

69
00:02:24,278 --> 00:02:26,580
And I won't stand for someone
making me something I'm not.

70
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:30,718
Are you any closer to
finding out who did this?

71
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:33,554
Yes. Well, a little.

72
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:35,956
He calls himself
"The Sinnerman."

73
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,124
From what I can gather,

74
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,294
he's a criminal mastermind
who just moved his operation

75
00:02:40,328 --> 00:02:42,730
to Los Angeles, but no one
seems to have ever met him,

76
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:45,499
which makes punching him in the
face frustratingly difficult.

77
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:47,768
Well, maybe... (groans)

78
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:48,802
Doctor,

79
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,804
are you sure you're all right
to be back at work?

80
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:52,306
I mean, it really
hasn't been that long

81
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,641
since Mum flambéed you.

82
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:56,477
Yes. It certainly was a...

83
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,978
traumatic experience.

84
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,913
Fortunately, I'm trained to deal
with that sort of thing,

85
00:02:59,947 --> 00:03:01,315
and I'm doing just that.

86
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:03,451
And there's nothing
I can do to help?

87
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:05,753
Yes. You can let me
get back to you.

88
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:07,921
Oh, if you insist.

89
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:11,625
Oh, I haven't even told you
the worst part, have I?

90
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:13,461
Not only did he stick
my wings back on

91
00:03:13,494 --> 00:03:15,863
and take my face,
he's stolen my shtick as well.

92
00:03:17,365 --> 00:03:18,466
He gives out favors to people

93
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:20,368
for a price to be named later.

94
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:21,569
Sound familiar?

95
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:26,307
Lucifer, you didn't invent
the idea of giving out favors.

96
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,310
(chuckles) Yep,
forgot who I was talking to.

97
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:31,345
I suppose you did.

98
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,547
But you haven't given
out favors in a while.

99
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:34,982
And the Sinnerman knows it.

100
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:36,850
I think he's
taunting me.

101
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:38,352
Do you think he's human?

102
00:03:38,386 --> 00:03:39,787
Or something else?

103
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,622
I don't know.

104
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:45,025
But whatever he is, I'm gonna
stop at nothing to find him.

105
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,327
CHLOE:
We found him.

106
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,329
LUCIFER:
Who? The missing link?

107
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:50,464
Proof of human-rodent
copulation.

108
00:03:50,498 --> 00:03:51,532
It's Mike Alonso.

109
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,601
The guy that skewered your
kidnapper under the pier.

110
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:56,036
(scoffs) This is clearly
not the Sinnerman.

111
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,038
Clearly not,
since I'm pretty sure

112
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,907
that no one with that name
actually exists.

113
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,776
He had motive, no alibi,

114
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,878
and, oh, yeah,
he confessed

115
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,780
under interrogation.
He's our guy.

116
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:08,582
Well, then he must be
working for the Sinnerman.

117
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:11,051
You're not gonna drag me

118
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,886
into whatever new
weird drama this is.

119
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,588
And could you please

120
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:15,956
stop saying "Sinnerman"?

121
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:17,425
Sinnerman.

122
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:19,927
Big Nina Simone fan?

123
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,529
Well, actually, I am.
But I was just saying
What? Nothing.

124
00:04:21,562 --> 00:04:22,463
to the detective...
Nothing. It's nothing.

125
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:26,700
Are you hiding something
from me, Detective?

126
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:29,637
No.

127
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,339
I don't care;
I was just asking.

128
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:33,874
New case came in,
you're up.

129
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:34,942
Thank you.

130
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:36,143
(sighs)

131
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:39,079
Okay. Why did you just stop me
telling the new lieutenant

132
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,948
we're on the cusp of the
greatest case of our lives?

133
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:44,485
Because the Sinnerman is an
urban myth; he doesn't exist.

134
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:46,320
He's a boogeyman
that criminals use

135
00:04:46,354 --> 00:04:47,555
to hide their bad behavior.

136
00:04:47,588 --> 00:04:49,056
"Oh, the Sinnerman
made me do it."

137
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:50,624
Yet another thing
he's stolen from me,

138
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:53,060
being blamed for
the bad deeds of men.

139
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:55,563
He can keep that one, actually.
(scoffs) So the idea

140
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:57,898
of telling our new boss--

141
00:04:57,931 --> 00:04:59,967
who I'm just starting
to get a rhythm with--

142
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,102
that you want to arrest
the Easter Bunny

143
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,637
doesn't really thrill me.

144
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:04,772
I have no intention
of arresting anyone.

145
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,774
I want to grab him by his
neck and see what happens

146
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,342
when I squeeze hard enough.

147
00:05:08,376 --> 00:05:12,079
If you can bring me
any tiny bit of evidence

148
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:13,781
that the Sinnerman
actually exists,

149
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,449
I will be the first
to look into it.

150
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:17,117
But...

151
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:21,021
until then,
consider this case closed.

152
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,990
And let's focus
on this case, please.

153
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:24,392
Okay.

154
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:25,459
* Ah, ah, ah

155
00:05:25,493 --> 00:05:28,128
* Ah-ah, ah, ah, ah-ah
* Come on *

156
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,564
* I'm gonna handcuff lightning

157
00:05:30,598 --> 00:05:34,502
* Throw thunder in the ring

158
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:36,470
* Won't slack,
won't turn my back *

159
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:39,640
* I'll get on my knees
and pray *
(train horn blows)

160
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:43,143
* My heart beats
strong as rock *

161
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,479
* My blood runs cold and hot

162
00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:48,482
* My eyes see what you got

163
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:50,984
* I'll get on my knees
and pray *

164
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:53,120
LUCIFER:
(whistles) Daniel?

165
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:55,589
Guy's name
is JD Woodstock.

166
00:05:55,623 --> 00:05:57,458
He lived right
around the corner.

167
00:05:57,491 --> 00:05:58,959
Neighbors said he
was pretty quiet.

168
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:00,628
Unemployed, but we
found this on him.

169
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:02,430
Huh.

170
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:05,899
So what are these? Jokes?

171
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:08,502
A charitable description,
Detective.

172
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:09,503
"Avocado?

173
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:11,505
How about avoca-don't?"

174
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:13,040
Would it be rude
to throw tomatoes at a corpse?

175
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:14,908
DAN: Looks like he was
a struggling comedian.

176
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:17,077
We're trying to figure out
if he performed anywhere.

177
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,546
What'd he do? Make
fun of the wrong person?

178
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:19,880
Get in a fight with
an audience member?

179
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:21,615
It's worth exploring,
at least.

180
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:23,484
You know, there are a lot
of insult comics out there,

181
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:25,453
and not everybody
enjoys being mocked.

182
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:26,854
Hmm. We should listen
to Daniel, actually.

183
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,589
He's got a unique
insight into this case.

184
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:30,190
What's he talking about?

185
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,592
Well, they're
kindred spirits.

186
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,561
A fellow broken
soul who puts

187
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:34,862
the most embarrassing parts
of his life on display

188
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,430
for his audience
for an easy laugh.

189
00:06:36,464 --> 00:06:38,632
He does stand-up;
I do improv.

190
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:39,700
They're completely
different things.

191
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:40,968
Oh.
Improv

192
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:42,603
is all about "yes, and."

193
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:43,904
Stand-up, well, that's about
telling jokes...

194
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:45,739
I-I regret starting
this entire conversation.

195
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:47,908
Wait. Excuse me, Dan.

196
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:48,809
You do improv?

197
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:51,712
How did I not know that?
And how did he?

198
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,547
Well, it's a funny story,
actually.
Actually,

199
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:55,082
it's because I-I don't
tell a lot of people.

200
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:56,049
Why?

201
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,718
Yeah-- hey, Ella.

202
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,553
How's it going?
What'd you find?

203
00:06:59,587 --> 00:07:02,590
Well, no murder weapon, but I
did find three shell casings.

204
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:04,592
Running ballistics
on them now.

205
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,160
But, based on the
firing pattern,

206
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:10,664
I think this dude was tortured
before he finally died.

207
00:07:10,698 --> 00:07:12,600
Oh, well congratulations,
Mr. Woodstock.

208
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,668
At least someone cared enough
about your jokes to...

209
00:07:14,702 --> 00:07:15,669
ELLA: Did you just
say Woodstock?

210
00:07:15,703 --> 00:07:18,005
As in, JD Woodstock?

211
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:19,172
Yeah. Why?
You know him?

212
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:20,574
Yeah. He made big news
a couple days ago,

213
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:22,510
claiming Bobby Lowe
stole his jokes.

214
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:24,612
And who is Bobby Lowe?
A rival comedian

215
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:26,680
who hates himself so much
he stole this drivel?

216
00:07:26,714 --> 00:07:29,783
Uh, no.

217
00:07:29,817 --> 00:07:31,585
Open your eyes, pal.

218
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:33,921
Yeah. JD claimed
that Bobby's show

219
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,489
was based on
his own material.

220
00:07:35,523 --> 00:07:36,624
And that he
could prove it.

221
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:38,158
Which is impossible,

222
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:40,628
because Bobby Lowe's show
is all about his life.

223
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:42,596
Wait, so you're saying that
this giant-headed buffoon

224
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,632
stole our poor
victim's ideas?

225
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:46,834
His life's work
and built a business out of it?

226
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:49,703
Mm. So now he's a "poor victim."

227
00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:51,572
Look, I know you don't
believe me, Detective,

228
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:53,273
but I happen to be going through
something quite similar,

229
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,775
so if I can't get
my own justice,

230
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:58,546
I'm gonna get it for
this poor unfunny soul.

231
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:01,181
Well, I certainly did want you
to focus on this case,

232
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:02,983
but be careful
what you wish for.

233
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:05,519
At least the lieutenant
isn't here.

234
00:08:05,553 --> 00:08:08,121
You know, if you keep saying
crazy things around him,

235
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,957
(over microphone):
who knows what he might do.

236
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,292
Right. When have I ever
cared about that, Detective?

237
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,961
Ah, that's true.
(chuckles)

238
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,729
(indistinct conversation
continues over microphone)

239
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:20,701
*

240
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:30,978
JD:
I sweated over every joke.

241
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,213
Worked my ass off for months.

242
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:36,283
And Bobby stole it all
like it was nothing.

243
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:40,654
Created a show
based on my jokes!

244
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:42,656
Well Bobby, guess what?

245
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,224
I finally found it.

246
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,994
Proof you're a fraud.

247
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:51,264
And I'm going to show it
to the world.

248
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:54,334
Well? Which of these boxes
do I click on for the proof?

249
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,704
None. He posted this video
the day before he died.

250
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:59,072
And we can't find whatever proof
he claimed to have had.

251
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:01,008
So that's why JD
was tortured,

252
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,876
so the killer could
find and destroy it?

253
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,579
ELLA: (coughs)
Or he's a liar.

254
00:09:05,613 --> 00:09:07,280
Huh?

255
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:08,749
I'm not sure who said that,

256
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:12,620
but I totally agree with them.

257
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,655
Bobby Lowe would never
do something like that.

258
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:16,189
Why do you say that?
Because,

259
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,626
Bobby's show is so personal.

260
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:19,960
It's so authentic.

261
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:21,294
There's no way that
you could fake it.

262
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:22,630
Right. Don't listen to her.

263
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:23,797
The man is
clearly a thief.

264
00:09:23,831 --> 00:09:25,065
Let's go give him
a good throttling.

265
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:26,900
CHLOE: I'm leaning towards
just talking to him.

266
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:28,035
And then throttling.
I suppose a little foreplay

267
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,202
never hurt anyone.

268
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:30,103
Wait.

269
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:31,038
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You guys are gonna

270
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,774
go talk to him, like,
right now this second?

271
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:34,975
Yeah. Why?

272
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:36,744
Maybe I should go with.

273
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:39,913
You know, to collect
the evidence.

274
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:42,816
Right. Well, if
he's innocent...
He's not innocent.

275
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,619
If he's innocent,
then there won't

276
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:47,054
be any evidence
to collect,

277
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,922
so probably better
if you hang here.

278
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:51,925
Yeah. I-I see what
you're saying there,

279
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:52,926
but...

280
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,762
I just think, to be safe,

281
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:57,064
I should collect
as much stuff as possible.

282
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,066
You know, fingerprints,
a lock of hair, an autograph.

283
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,634
Right.

284
00:10:00,668 --> 00:10:02,770
To be safe.

285
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:04,672
Okay.

286
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:06,006
To be safe.

287
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,975
Yeah!

288
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,345
* Lipstick stuck on

289
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:14,414
* High heels sharpened

290
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,349
* Eyes lined, it's on

291
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:19,119
* Think it's time to
get my walk on... *

292
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:20,721
Hey.

293
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:22,856
Hey.

294
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:23,991
Yeah.

295
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:25,826
Thanks for meeting
me, Amenadiel.

296
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:28,028
Is there a shorter version
of that?

297
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:30,363
Does anyone ever
call you "Amen"?

298
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:31,431
(chuckles)

299
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,933
Probably not.

300
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,434
Oh, you would be the first.

301
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,737
(laughs)

302
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:37,938
So, Linda,
what's going on?

303
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:42,075
Um, I just wanted
to say thank you.

304
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,978
For saving my life.

305
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:46,313
Maze is the one
who saved your life.

306
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:47,815
And I thanked
her so much,

307
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:49,149
I think she's avoiding me now.

308
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:54,387
But I wouldn't be here
without you, too.

309
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:56,990
I didn't do anything.

310
00:10:57,024 --> 00:10:59,192
Other than miraculously
slowing down time

311
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:00,961
so that I didn't
bleed to death?

312
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,896
Well, other than that.

313
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:05,298
(chuckles)

314
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:06,967
How are you really doing,
by the way?

315
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,401
I'm fine.

316
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,240
You have your powers back.

317
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:14,407
That must be exciting.

318
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:18,746
Mm. Um, not exactly.

319
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,313
They haven't worked
since that day.

320
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:23,116
I'm sorry to hear that.

321
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,084
Ah, don't be.

322
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:26,987
I think it's just my Father
testing me again.

323
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,189
But this time,
Linda, I'm ready.

324
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:30,758
How is He testing you?

325
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,728
Do you have to
fight someone?

326
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:36,463
Solve advanced
math problems?

327
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:41,735
Well, if I'm right,
there's something I need to do

328
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:44,104
in the penthouse and, uh...

329
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:46,373
I've been avoiding it.

330
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:50,110
Well, you helped me.

331
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:53,747
Why don't you let
me help you with...

332
00:11:53,781 --> 00:11:55,482
whatever this is?

333
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:56,984
Unless it's math.

334
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:58,485
Oh, it's not math.

335
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:00,854
Then I'm sure I
can handle it.

336
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,397
Oh. Severed angel wings
in a closet.

337
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,865
Of course.

338
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:14,001
Totally handleable.

339
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:16,136
My irresponsible brother
left them here

340
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:19,106
for any half-drunk human
to stumble onto.

341
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:24,044
Proof of the divine just
left on the floor like...

342
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:27,114
like used laundry.

343
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:30,984
For some reason,
I imagined they just

344
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:33,086
magically disappeared
when he cut them off.

345
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,155
But this...

346
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:37,124
yeah, this is gruesome.

347
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:38,826
Mm-hmm.

348
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:40,027
You know where
the garbage bags are?

349
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:48,435
DAN:
Hi, Lieutenant.

350
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:50,170
I just wanted to come by
and talk.

351
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:52,105
Kind of feel like we
got off on the wrong foot.

352
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:55,042
Pretty sure we're on exactly
the foot I want to be on.

353
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,012
I'm not a bad guy.

354
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:00,480
And I'm not a dirty cop.

355
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,452
So, you didn't check a gun
out of evidence

356
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:07,087
that was used to commit a crime?

357
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,223
I mean, yes.

358
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:13,193
At least it wasn't
a homicide, right?

359
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:15,228
Well, it, um...
(clears throat)

360
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:18,131
I-I was... I just...
Stop.

361
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:19,566
I was gonna string
this along,

362
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:22,169
but it's already a
little too sad for me.

363
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:24,371
I'm actually glad
you came in.

364
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:27,107
(sighs)
Really?

365
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,509
I want all the intel that
you gathered on Lucifer.

366
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:32,245
Why would I have any
intel on Lucifer?

367
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,181
Because when he first started
working with Decker,

368
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:35,883
you were still
married to her.

369
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,317
And I'm guessing
you broke the rules

370
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,186
and dug up everything
you could on him.

371
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:41,154
(laughs)

372
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:43,356
I didn't. I mean...

373
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:47,094
Yeah. I did.

374
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:49,229
I'd like it all
on my desk in an hour.

375
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:57,637
That's the biggest cock
I've ever seen.

376
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,139
WOMAN: And, uh,
makeup right now.

377
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,340
Mm-hmm. Oh, whoa, whoa,
excuse me, guys.

378
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:02,109
You guys can't be back here.
CHLOE: We're looking for...

379
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:03,643
Bobby Lowe!

380
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,278
Uh, right.
WOMAN: Oh, no, no.

381
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:06,479
Oh, my God, please, no.

382
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,381
He doesn't like visitors.

383
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:09,917
Damn, I can't get fired.

384
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:13,186
ELLA: Oh, my God, it's
really Bobby Lowe.

385
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,222
What did I say?

386
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:17,124
I'm sorry.
No eye contact,

387
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:19,392
no green Skittles
in my candy jar

388
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:21,228
and no guests!

389
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:24,164
I'm Detective Chloe Decker,
LAPD.

390
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,934
We want to talk to you about
the murder of JD Woodstock.

391
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:27,968
Why are you stopping?

392
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:30,637
Show starts in five minutes,
honey. Chop-chop.

393
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,672
God, he just called her honey.
So sweet.

394
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,574
Is this about that
stupid podcast?

395
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:36,944
You really think
I stole jokes? Me?

396
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:37,844
Very much so, yes.
Of course not.

397
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,313
(scoffs)
CHLOE:
What I think is I'd like

398
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:42,015
to explore his accusations,

399
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:43,416
starting with where
you were when he died.

400
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,118
(sighs)
You know why people

401
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:47,120
accuse others
of stealing material?

402
00:14:47,154 --> 00:14:48,255
Because the others are thieves?

403
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:50,190
Because they're failures.

404
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,424
And instead of facing that,

405
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,961
they blame successful
people like me.

406
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:55,462
How dare you...
Uh...

407
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:57,364
They're ready for you, Bobby.

408
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:01,001
Look, some of us
have important work to do,

409
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:03,270
like entertaining America.

410
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:05,138
If you'd like to see
how it's done,

411
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:06,239
take a seat.

412
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:09,376
Charming.

413
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,979
I can't believe it.

414
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:15,448
He invited us to a taping.

415
00:15:15,482 --> 00:15:18,518
(audience cheering)
WOMAN: Are you ready to laugh?

416
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:19,719
Wait, what, what?

417
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,221
No, I can't hear you guys.

418
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,222
Come on.

419
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,324
I bribed you with T-shirts.

420
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:25,625
I phoned in all my best jokes.

421
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:26,626
What more do you want?

422
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:27,995
Oh, yeah.

423
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:30,097
More T-shirts!

424
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,399
Yeah!
Let's try that again.

425
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:33,566
Look what I got.

426
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,335
Are you ready to laugh?

427
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:37,337
AUDIENCE: Yeah!
All right, guys.

428
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,371
Let's start the show.

429
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:39,472
*

430
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:41,474
Yeah!

431
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:43,176
Oh, there he is,
there he is.

432
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,112
(audience cheering)

433
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:54,754
Well, that was the worst date
of my entire life.

434
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,223
(audience laughs)

435
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:57,324
Oh, come on now, Bobby.

436
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:59,326
I'm sure it
wasn't that bad.

437
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:01,328
BOBBY: She left before
we got dessert.

438
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:04,197
PUPPET: But dessert's the
best part of the meal, Bobby.

439
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:05,665
(audience cheers)

440
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:09,102
Well, on the upside, you have
been trying to lose weight.

441
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:10,203
(laughs)

442
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:12,605
I didn't say I left
before dessert.

443
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,775
This is what that arrogant
fraud is so proud of?
Shh.

444
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,078
(whispering):
Wait, what's this show about?

445
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:19,212
(whispering):
Oh. Those are his

446
00:16:19,246 --> 00:16:20,613
imaginary friends.

447
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:23,216
They help him deal
with his insecurities.

448
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,584
Oh.
We've all been
there, right?

449
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:26,419
BOBBY: I'll just impress
her at the party.
Right.

450
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:28,021
LUCIFER:
Excuse me.

451
00:16:28,055 --> 00:16:29,256
Excuse me.

452
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:30,257
Time out.

453
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,324
Excuse me.

454
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:32,392
(laughing): Sorry.

455
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:34,027
You stole a dead man's work

456
00:16:34,061 --> 00:16:35,328
and turned it into this?

457
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:36,629
Get lost, Fraggle Rock.

458
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,765
BOBBY: What do you think
you're doing, man?

459
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,267
Stealing your show,

460
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,269
which only seems fair
as you stole it first.

461
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:43,636
Hey, mind your
own business, Dr. Who.

462
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,039
Pip pip out of here.

463
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:47,307
Dr. Who?
(audience laughs)

464
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,442
Don't laugh.

465
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:51,211
(audience gasps)
(screams)

466
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:52,479
Oh, geez.

467
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,414
It's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

468
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:55,515
Right, what have you got
to say for yourself?

469
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:56,649
Beat it, handy.

470
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:59,052
I'm not talking to you.
Get the hell out of my set, man.

471
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:01,221
Okay. Okay, fine.
Don't talk to me.

472
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:03,456
Let's have a chat with one of
your old friends, shall we?

473
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,125
What have we got in here?
You can't touch those puppets.

474
00:17:05,158 --> 00:17:06,226
Does anyone work here?!

475
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:09,062
Ah, here we go. All right,
this one looks good.
No.

476
00:17:09,096 --> 00:17:10,297
No, no, n-no,
put-put that...

477
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,199
put that down.
(silly voice):
What? What?

478
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:15,535
Jealous someone else
has their hand up my butt?

479
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:19,072
Actually, this apparatus
is more difficult than...

480
00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:20,673
BOBBY: Seriously, put it down.
Ah, there's the trigger.

481
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,442
Right. Where was I?
(silly voice): You...

482
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:24,677
(gunshot)
(audience gasps, screams)

483
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:28,181
WOMAN: I'm telling you,
just get down, get down.

484
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:30,483
(chuckles)
Oh, don't worry, everyone.

485
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:32,319
There's just a gun
stashed inside the puppet.

486
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:34,787
Lucifer, put the gun down.
LUCIFER: Right.

487
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:36,556
Right. Yes.

488
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:38,291
Well, at least no one was hurt.

489
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:44,497
Uh... he did it.

490
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,803
Are you insane? You
could've killed him.

491
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:54,474
Me? I'm not the one who hid
a gun up a puppet's backside.

492
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:55,608
Or have all the puppets
got guns in them?

493
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:56,843
If so, I'll set my DVR.

494
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:59,312
No. We never used that puppet.

495
00:17:59,346 --> 00:18:01,248
It was my imaginary friend's
imaginary friend.

496
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:02,482
The character didn't land.

497
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:04,184
I wonder why.
So you hid a gun in it?

498
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:05,352
I didn't think some lunatic

499
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:06,486
was gonna try to kill me
with it.

500
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:07,787
It's just a flesh wound.

501
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,256
And you admit
that it's your gun?

502
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:10,490
Yeah.

503
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:12,259
Ah, I see.

504
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:14,194
So you killed our poor victim,
ran back to work

505
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:15,562
and keistered it
in an old puppet.

506
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,164
ELLA:
Not the murder weapon.

507
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:20,500
This is a .380, and the
murderer used a 9mm.

508
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:23,203
All that means is that he hid
his other gun somewhere else.

509
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:25,372
So come on. Prostate exams
for all the puppets.

510
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:28,608
Lucifer...
BOBBY: I don't
have another gun.

511
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:30,777
I didn't kill JD.

512
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,413
I don't believe you.
You're a thief.

513
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,515
You took everything JD had,
even his life.

514
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:38,451
So come on, what more
could you possibly desire?

515
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,356
(quietly):
I want out of this hell.

516
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:49,196
Every day I come to work, and I
tell stupid jokes with puppets.

517
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:50,497
Puppets!

518
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,499
SHEILA:
Bobby.

519
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:53,400
What are you saying?

520
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:54,567
This is a dream gig.

521
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:55,668
It's a nightmare!

522
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:57,470
You know what
the biggest joke is?

523
00:18:57,504 --> 00:18:58,538
You?

524
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:00,573
Me!
(exhales)

525
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:03,476
(chuckles) It's no fun
when they talk to themselves.

526
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:06,779
And now that JD's dead,
I'm never getting out of here.

527
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,448
What do you mean?

528
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,617
(sighs)

529
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,552
He was telling the truth.

530
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:18,358
I stole his act.

531
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:20,293
I based the show on it.

532
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:24,564
But I defended you!

533
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:27,400
J'accuse, Bobby Lowe!

534
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:28,568
J'accuse!

535
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,904
If you wanted out
of the job so bad,

536
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:33,806
why didn't you
just admit it and quit?

537
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,376
Golden handcuffs.

538
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:38,545
If I quit, I lose all the money.

539
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:41,648
And I really like the money.

540
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,983
CHLOE: And if JD revealed
that you were stealing

541
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,652
his act, and they fire you...

542
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,654
I get a golden parachute
instead.

543
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,822
Which is why I had
to keep up appearances,

544
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,724
not let anyone know the truth.

545
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:53,993
But why hide the gun on set?
Yeah.

546
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,161
Because I was getting
death threats.

547
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:59,299
Someone's pissed, claiming
all my jokes are about him.

548
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:02,269
The jokes that you stole
like the thief which you are?

549
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:03,836
That's a big strong,
Miss Lopez.

550
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,606
Yeah.

551
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:09,742
Any idea who was making
these threats?

552
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:12,011
They came
from an anonymous e-mail.

553
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,514
But like I said,
I stole the jokes.

554
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,783
The only person who knows
who they're about...

555
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:18,785
Is the dead guy. Great.

556
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:20,887
I'm gonna need those e-mails.

557
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,656
(quietly):
All right.

558
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,292
*

559
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:32,399
(groans):
God.

560
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:35,635
This must be so painful.

561
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:38,905
Cutting off a piece of
yourself over and over.

562
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:44,711
Lucifer made it seem
like no big deal, but...

563
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,413
ouch.

564
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:48,815
We all have pain
that we hide, Linda,

565
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:51,618
that we're just not ready
to share with the world.

566
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:56,656
That's very true.

567
00:20:58,525 --> 00:21:00,827
How do you know it's a test?

568
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:04,063
Because I'm faced with having
to dispose of the one thing

569
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,965
that I so desperately want back.

570
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:08,901
Could just be really bad luck.
No.

571
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:11,304
My Father always has a plan.

572
00:21:11,338 --> 00:21:13,373
I don't doubt that anymore.

573
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,677
Seems awfully cruel.

574
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,480
Well, if it were easy,
it wouldn't be much of a test.

575
00:21:20,513 --> 00:21:21,548
Would it?

576
00:21:29,656 --> 00:21:31,724
"I know what you're doing.
Stop making fun of me,

577
00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:33,860
or else I'm going to stab you."

578
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:35,728
"I know you're
making fun of me.

579
00:21:35,762 --> 00:21:37,664
Stop or I'll
kill you."

580
00:21:37,697 --> 00:21:39,332
Dreadfully unoriginal,
aren't they?

581
00:21:39,366 --> 00:21:41,668
Looks like the threats
stopped last week

582
00:21:41,701 --> 00:21:44,337
after JD posted his video.

583
00:21:44,371 --> 00:21:46,339
So you think the killer saw it
and then realized

584
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:48,575
he'd been threatening the
wrong comedian the entire time?

585
00:21:48,608 --> 00:21:50,443
And then killed JD
after he realized

586
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:52,679
he was the guy
actually making fun of him.

587
00:21:52,712 --> 00:21:53,746
Seems possible.

588
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,914
So...

589
00:21:54,947 --> 00:21:56,683
what's the joke
that he's so angry about?

590
00:21:56,716 --> 00:21:58,818
Did our killer have
unfunny imaginary friends?

591
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:01,521
No, that happened later.

592
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:03,456
I did some research,
and originally,

593
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,592
the show was
much edgier.

594
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:06,693
Hmm?

595
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:09,696
About a guy dealing with
his insecurities about his,

596
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:11,030
um...

597
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:14,000
W-Well, I really don't
want to tell you.

598
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:15,868
Ooh. Well, now I need to know.

599
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:21,641
Dealing with his insecurities
about his, um, micropenis.

600
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:26,045
All right, well.

601
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:28,114
Hold me closer, tiny donger.

602
00:22:28,147 --> 00:22:30,116
So you're saying we're looking
for a needle in a penis stack.

603
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:32,619
See, this is why I
didn't want to tell you.

604
00:22:32,652 --> 00:22:34,454
Anyhow, after it became
a family show...
Mm.

605
00:22:34,487 --> 00:22:35,788
...the micropenis
got removed.

606
00:22:35,822 --> 00:22:37,390
Did anyone even notice?
(laughs)

607
00:22:37,424 --> 00:22:38,691
Okay.

608
00:22:38,725 --> 00:22:40,393
Okay.

609
00:22:40,427 --> 00:22:41,961
Just go to town.

610
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:43,963
Get them all out of your system.

611
00:22:43,996 --> 00:22:45,665
(exhales)

612
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,701
What?

613
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:51,037
Well, perhaps...

614
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:53,740
perhaps we should
consider this case closed.

615
00:22:53,773 --> 00:22:54,574
Excuse me?

616
00:22:54,607 --> 00:22:56,776
Well, we thought
Bobby stole a joke,

617
00:22:56,809 --> 00:23:00,413
but in actual fact, our deceased
stole this man's very essence.

618
00:23:00,447 --> 00:23:02,415
I mean, his tiny,
microscopic essence, sure,

619
00:23:02,449 --> 00:23:03,750
but his essence nonetheless.

620
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:05,585
So, uh, in actual fact,

621
00:23:05,618 --> 00:23:07,153
I think our killer
is the victim here.

622
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:09,822
Yeah, that's actually
not how it works.

623
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:11,491
We still need to
find our killer.

624
00:23:11,524 --> 00:23:14,527
I'll get these to cyber,
see if they can trace an I.P.

625
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:17,797
(sighs)

626
00:23:21,868 --> 00:23:22,935
(elevator bell dings)
What? No.

627
00:23:22,969 --> 00:23:24,871
Not "cinnamon,"
"Sinnerman."

628
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:27,607
He's not a spice, Maze.

629
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,909
Well, yes, I know
you have a hectic schedule,

630
00:23:29,942 --> 00:23:33,780
but surely you can find time
to track him down for me.

631
00:23:33,813 --> 00:23:35,782
Right. Stop pretending
the call is cutting out, Maze.

632
00:23:35,815 --> 00:23:37,083
I taught you that trick.

633
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:38,785
Maze.

634
00:23:38,818 --> 00:23:41,521
Mazikeen!

635
00:23:41,554 --> 00:23:43,490
(groans)

636
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:53,633
PIERCE: Lucifer
Morningstar.

637
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:57,504
I've figured out
what you really are.

638
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,913
So, it's come
to this, has it?

639
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:09,549
Finally, someone in the police
department realized that I am

640
00:24:09,582 --> 00:24:12,218
exactly what I say I am:
the Devil himself.

641
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:13,786
(chuckles)

642
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,154
Well, I'm surprised
it's taken you this long.

643
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:16,222
I have no idea
why you prance around

644
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:17,524
and call yourself the Devil.

645
00:24:17,557 --> 00:24:18,691
"Prance"?

646
00:24:18,725 --> 00:24:21,160
This is about the Sinnerman.

647
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:22,862
(laughing):
Right.

648
00:24:22,895 --> 00:24:24,063
I see what's happening here.

649
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:26,533
A mysterious figure
handing out favors,

650
00:24:26,566 --> 00:24:27,800
probably dashing and handsome.

651
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:29,569
You think I'm the Sinnerman.

652
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:30,703
Well, truth is...

653
00:24:30,737 --> 00:24:33,640
You're not the Sinnerman--
he's smart and calculated.

654
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:34,941
You don't know me.

655
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:37,877
Maybe I am the Sinnerman.
Surprise!

656
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,079
No, I followed you
and looked into your history.

657
00:24:41,581 --> 00:24:42,849
You're impulsive
and short-fused.

658
00:24:42,882 --> 00:24:44,651
I am not.

659
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:48,020
(stifled laugh)

660
00:24:48,054 --> 00:24:49,556
Very well.

661
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:51,257
What is it that you think I am?

662
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,892
An idiot.

663
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:54,026
(chuckles)

664
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,195
So what, you broke into
my apartment just to insult me?

665
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:58,731
You could've just waited
till I was in the office.

666
00:24:58,765 --> 00:25:00,099
No, I came here to warn you.

667
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:02,201
I know you're
looking into him,

668
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:05,104
but you have no idea
what you're doing.

669
00:25:05,137 --> 00:25:06,939
The Sinnerman is not a myth.

670
00:25:06,973 --> 00:25:08,841
Very aware of that already,
thank you.

671
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:10,677
It's not a name to throw around.

672
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,044
Not even at the precinct.

673
00:25:12,078 --> 00:25:13,880
That's why I came
here to talk.

674
00:25:13,913 --> 00:25:15,214
He's that dangerous.

675
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:16,983
So am I.

676
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:18,585
Maybe so.

677
00:25:18,618 --> 00:25:21,788
Either way, you need to know
who you're dealing with.

678
00:25:21,821 --> 00:25:23,956
I've butted heads with him
in Chicago.

679
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,692
Did not end well.

680
00:25:25,725 --> 00:25:27,894
Then, what? You ran here with
your tail between your legs?

681
00:25:27,927 --> 00:25:29,161
I did, yeah.

682
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:30,930
Oh.

683
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:35,768
He killed someone...
close to me.

684
00:25:35,802 --> 00:25:37,937
Really damn close.

685
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:41,040
I don't want what happened to
me to happen to anyone else.

686
00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:43,042
Even you.

687
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:44,243
You need to be careful.

688
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:47,179
He stole from me, Lieutenant,
and I won't stand for it.

689
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:49,081
You're not listening.
Yes, I am.

690
00:25:49,115 --> 00:25:50,783
Now you listen to me.

691
00:25:50,817 --> 00:25:53,920
You can keep your head buried
in the sand if you want to,

692
00:25:53,953 --> 00:25:57,990
while I go mano a Sinnermano,
all right?

693
00:25:58,024 --> 00:25:58,891
I've got this.

694
00:26:01,661 --> 00:26:03,562
(exhales)

695
00:26:05,131 --> 00:26:07,166
(sirens wailing in distance)

696
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:08,935
LINDA:
So...

697
00:26:08,968 --> 00:26:10,002
Compost?

698
00:26:10,036 --> 00:26:13,039
Recycling?

699
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:16,976
I've never had to dispose
of pieces of divinity before.

700
00:26:20,947 --> 00:26:22,014
Waste.

701
00:26:29,055 --> 00:26:34,326
I thought this would be
a little more... reverential?

702
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,796
Less angel wing
dumpster fire.

703
00:26:39,732 --> 00:26:41,233
Should we say something?

704
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:43,069
I feel like we should
say something...

705
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:45,071
What do you want me
to say here, Linda?

706
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:47,039
I didn't choose this test.

707
00:26:47,073 --> 00:26:50,342
I don't even know if
this really is a test.

708
00:26:50,376 --> 00:26:53,312
I mean, maybe I'm just
torturing myself here.

709
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:58,651
But if Lucifer wants to treat
his wings like trash,

710
00:26:58,685 --> 00:27:01,420
then trash they shall be.
Even if it pains me

711
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,122
in my very soul.

712
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:06,192
I don't think Lucifer knows
how much this hurts you.

713
00:27:06,225 --> 00:27:08,661
He never does.

714
00:27:08,695 --> 00:27:09,996
And even though he
doesn't realize it,

715
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:14,433
everything he does seems
designed to hurt me.

716
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:17,169
To test you?

717
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:21,340
Huh. Wow.

718
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,978
You're right.

719
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:30,016
It's been right in front
of my face all along.

720
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:31,684
My test is Lucifer.

721
00:27:31,718 --> 00:27:33,252
It's always been Lucifer.

722
00:27:37,423 --> 00:27:39,225
You're very wise, Linda.

723
00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:40,993
Thanks, Amen.

724
00:27:41,027 --> 00:27:43,295
Mm...
Yeah, it doesn't work, does it?

725
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:45,031
(laughs softly)

726
00:27:45,064 --> 00:27:47,967
* Ooh

727
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,136
* Ooh, ooh, ooh

728
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:53,239
* Ooh, ooh

729
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:55,942
* Ooh, ooh, ooh.

730
00:27:55,975 --> 00:27:58,477
(Lucifer panting)

731
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,479
I, uh, had a rather
illuminating conversation

732
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,148
with our new lieutenant
last night.

733
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:03,950
What did you do?
Nothing.

734
00:28:03,983 --> 00:28:06,252
Yet. He warned me not
to talk about the Sinnerman.

735
00:28:06,285 --> 00:28:07,419
Yeah, he's right.

736
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:09,121
You sound crazy... er.

737
00:28:09,155 --> 00:28:10,256
No. He actually knows...

738
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:12,959
Cyber tracked all the e-mails
to the same I.P. address.

739
00:28:12,992 --> 00:28:15,027
A comedy club on Sunset
called The Laughmaker.

740
00:28:15,061 --> 00:28:16,495
So do we think
he works there?

741
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,097
Maybe. The e-mails
were always sent

742
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,966
Thursday nights at 8:00 p.m.
And that's when

743
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:21,000
Bobby's show aired.
So it makes sense

744
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:21,968
that that could set him off.

745
00:28:22,001 --> 00:28:23,169
Yeah, it's also when
they have open mic night,

746
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:25,471
so it could be any one of
the comedians performing, too.

747
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:27,139
Or a diehard fan.

748
00:28:27,173 --> 00:28:28,507
Either way,
they're consistent.

749
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,976
It would make sense
that the killer

750
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:31,210
could be at the next
open mic night.

751
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:32,111
Which is tonight.

752
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:34,113
So how do we draw him out?
LUCIFER: Easy.

753
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:36,248
Arrest everyone in the club
and pull their pants down.

754
00:28:36,282 --> 00:28:37,917
Tiniest weenie wins, for once.

755
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,252
Or, our guy is clearly
sensitive, right?

756
00:28:40,286 --> 00:28:41,420
Why don't we use that
to flush him out?

757
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:43,990
What, get someone on stage
that'll really piss him off?

758
00:28:44,023 --> 00:28:46,058
Yeah. Yeah,
that could work.

759
00:28:46,092 --> 00:28:48,027
And I think we all know
the perfect man for that job.

760
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,163
WOMAN:
All right,

761
00:28:51,197 --> 00:28:54,200
please welcome to the stage,
for the first time,

762
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:56,468
the devilishly
handsome...

763
00:28:56,502 --> 00:28:59,738
Dan Espinoza.

764
00:29:04,811 --> 00:29:07,346
Remember "yes, and," Daniel.

765
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:09,148
(chuckles nervously)

766
00:29:14,353 --> 00:29:16,222
(man clears throat)
Hi, everybody.

767
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:18,825
WOMAN:
Hey. Hi.

768
00:29:18,858 --> 00:29:19,859
(clears throat)

769
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:21,027
So, uh... (chuckles)

770
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,194
Um...
(microphone feedback)

771
00:29:22,228 --> 00:29:23,963
MAN: Oh...
(short chuckle)

772
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:25,865
Uh, I have a friend.

773
00:29:25,898 --> 00:29:28,868
And... he's got a tiny penis.

774
00:29:28,901 --> 00:29:30,502
WOMAN: What?
Uh...

775
00:29:30,536 --> 00:29:32,371
a micropenis.

776
00:29:32,404 --> 00:29:34,306
Uh, in fact,

777
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,408
his penis is so tiny,
(woman groans)

778
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:39,111
it's not even a micropenis.

779
00:29:39,145 --> 00:29:40,412
It's an atomic penis.

780
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:42,581
(laughs)

781
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,851
(mouthing)
Because atoms
are small.

782
00:29:44,884 --> 00:29:47,353
Not because it ex... plodes.

783
00:29:47,386 --> 00:29:48,587
(Dan clears throat)

784
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,357
His, uh, penis is so small...
Boo!

785
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:54,426
It's a medical condition,
you monster.

786
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,262
(audience cheers)

787
00:29:58,998 --> 00:30:00,599
Lucifer...
What? Can't stop, won't stop.

788
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,134
This is much too
fun, Detective.

789
00:30:02,168 --> 00:30:04,270
No, no, no, keep going.
I want you to keep going.

790
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:05,271
Copy that.

791
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:06,605
DAN: Anyways...
So what?

792
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,307
Next you're gonna tell us
that his willy's

793
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,342
so small that
when he wants to have sex,

794
00:30:10,376 --> 00:30:12,078
he needs to call out
a search party?

795
00:30:12,111 --> 00:30:15,147
(audience laughs)
Or that his weenis
is so small,

796
00:30:15,181 --> 00:30:16,548
it looks like his
testicles are giving

797
00:30:16,582 --> 00:30:18,250
(high-pitched):
the tiniest thumbs up?

798
00:30:18,284 --> 00:30:19,318
(audience laughs)
Huh?

799
00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:20,352
Shame on you

800
00:30:20,386 --> 00:30:22,354
for mocking the poorly-endowed.

801
00:30:22,388 --> 00:30:24,623
MAN: Yeah!
LUCIFER: Oh, hold on.

802
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,258
Maybe there's no friend at all,

803
00:30:26,292 --> 00:30:28,094
and you're the one
with the baby carrot.

804
00:30:28,127 --> 00:30:29,996
(chuckles):
What? No.

805
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:32,098
No, I-I... I-I don't
have a micropenis.

806
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:34,166
I mean, not that there's
anything wrong with having one.

807
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,267
Come on.
Now's your chance.

808
00:30:35,301 --> 00:30:37,403
Show the world your teeny, tiny,
itsy-bitsy baby arm.

809
00:30:37,436 --> 00:30:39,438
I-I... I don't have
a tiny, teeny...

810
00:30:39,471 --> 00:30:40,406
LUCIFER:
It's okay!

811
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:42,474
We accept you
for your miniscule manhood.

812
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:45,477
I don't have a tiny...

813
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:47,113
WOMAN: Oh, my...
Lucifer.

814
00:30:47,146 --> 00:30:48,214
What, you didn't bring any?

815
00:30:48,247 --> 00:30:50,382
(chuckles)
Get off.

816
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:52,318
Or show us
your nubbin. Hmm?

817
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:54,586
MAN: Yeah!
Yeah. Boo!

818
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,222
(audience cheering, whistling)

819
00:30:56,255 --> 00:30:57,924
MAN:
There you go!

820
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,094
Oh, lovely.

821
00:31:02,128 --> 00:31:03,395
What the hell was that, man?

822
00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:05,497
You undermined
the entire sting.

823
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:07,366
Well, I'd argue
you undermined it

824
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:08,500
with your botched
attempt at humor.

825
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:10,602
(scoffs)
All I did was throw
a drowning man a tomato.

826
00:31:10,636 --> 00:31:12,438
Oh, what are the chances?

827
00:31:12,471 --> 00:31:14,340
I didn't even want to
do this to begin with.

828
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:18,044
And I told you stand-up and
improv are completely different.

829
00:31:18,077 --> 00:31:19,445
And why didn't you stop him?

830
00:31:19,478 --> 00:31:21,047
Because I realized the killer

831
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,381
might seek out
a sympathetic voice.

832
00:31:22,414 --> 00:31:23,415
Hmm.
He wasn't sympathetic.

833
00:31:23,449 --> 00:31:25,451
He just used it as an excuse

834
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:28,054
to tell even more
micropenis jokes.

835
00:31:28,087 --> 00:31:30,389
There is no way anyone's
gonna appreciate that.

836
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:31,523
MAN:
Hey, man.

837
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:33,525
I just, uh,
wanted to say...

838
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,327
really appreciate you
saying what you did.

839
00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:37,496
Huh.
Ah.

840
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:39,932
Absolutely.
No problem at all.

841
00:31:39,966 --> 00:31:42,368
I mean, someone has to stand up
for the little guy, am I right?

842
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:43,402
Yeah.

843
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:45,938
Hearing stuff like that just...

844
00:31:45,972 --> 00:31:47,206
makes you
want to murder someone,

845
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,374
doesn't it?

846
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:50,509
Sure does.
Hmm.

847
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:52,644
Well done, Detective.
Right, just to be sure,

848
00:31:52,678 --> 00:31:55,314
shall I pull his pants down,
or do you want the honors?

849
00:31:56,548 --> 00:31:57,950
You're gonna
do what?

850
00:31:57,984 --> 00:31:59,018
Follow me.
What?

851
00:31:59,051 --> 00:32:00,219
Come on.
I...

852
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:03,422
* Keep on doing
what you're doing. *

853
00:32:03,455 --> 00:32:06,192
I don't understand.

854
00:32:06,225 --> 00:32:08,327
Having a micropenis
isn't a crime.

855
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,596
(chuckles)
So you didn't send threatening
e-mails to Bobby Lowe?

856
00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:12,965
No, I did.

857
00:32:12,999 --> 00:32:15,234
Back when Bobby was nobody,
I toured with him.

858
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:17,136
And that's when I figured
he heard about my...

859
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:18,470
condition.

860
00:32:18,504 --> 00:32:20,039
(laughs softly)

861
00:32:20,072 --> 00:32:22,574
Um, how would he have
heard about that?

862
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:23,709
All the chuckle bunnies talk.

863
00:32:23,742 --> 00:32:24,710
The what?

864
00:32:24,743 --> 00:32:26,145
Uh...

865
00:32:26,178 --> 00:32:27,479
chicks who like to
have sex with comedians.

866
00:32:27,513 --> 00:32:28,680
Oh, there's a term for that?

867
00:32:28,714 --> 00:32:30,516
Oh, I should get
a term. (chuckles)

868
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:32,051
Oh.
Devil bunnies.

869
00:32:32,084 --> 00:32:33,385
Oh, no. Lucifans.

870
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:35,221
Can you please...?
Or not.

871
00:32:35,254 --> 00:32:36,989
One in particular,
I told some stories,

872
00:32:37,023 --> 00:32:39,491
and then, I heard them
as part of Bobby's set.

873
00:32:39,525 --> 00:32:40,692
So then,
you started threatening him.

874
00:32:40,726 --> 00:32:42,528
I was blowing off steam, okay?

875
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:43,996
Every time
that stupid show aired,

876
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:45,631
it was like
a punch in the gut.

877
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:48,667
And then you found out
that JD was writing the jokes.

878
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,436
And justifiably
murdered him.

879
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:52,104
I forgave him.

880
00:32:52,138 --> 00:32:53,439
LUCIFER:
What?

881
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:56,008
But he stole your life story
and profited from it.

882
00:32:56,042 --> 00:32:57,109
Why would you forgive him?

883
00:32:57,143 --> 00:33:00,079
I don't mind a fellow
struggling comic busting balls.

884
00:33:00,112 --> 00:33:03,215
It's when a millionaire starts
punching down that I get pissed.

885
00:33:03,249 --> 00:33:06,052
Or that good-looking jerk
from the club.

886
00:33:06,085 --> 00:33:07,486
What? Who's he talking about?
CHLOE: Oh.

887
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,521
Dan.
Oh. Right.

888
00:33:09,555 --> 00:33:11,523
Are you sure?
(mutters)

889
00:33:11,557 --> 00:33:14,460
Besides, JD's life
was pretty sad.

890
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,595
I mean, I think
his last gig was a barbecue.

891
00:33:16,628 --> 00:33:19,665
He even made up this sad story
about a warm-up comic wanting

892
00:33:19,698 --> 00:33:21,567
to meet with him about a gig.

893
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,635
(laughs) As if that'd happen.
LUCIFER: Why?

894
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:26,205
Is telling bad jokes before
even worse jokes a coveted gig?

895
00:33:26,238 --> 00:33:27,206
Are you kidding?

896
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:29,541
You work an hour a day
and clear six figures.

897
00:33:29,575 --> 00:33:31,277
Not to mention,
you probably get a role

898
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,544
in the show at some point.

899
00:33:32,578 --> 00:33:34,546
Oh.
Really?

900
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:37,383
Do you remember the name
of the, uh, warm-up comedian?

901
00:33:37,416 --> 00:33:40,552
Uh, Shelly maybe, or...?

902
00:33:40,586 --> 00:33:42,454
Sheila?
Yeah, that was it.

903
00:33:42,488 --> 00:33:43,689
Do you know her?

904
00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:45,624
We're done here.

905
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:48,494
LUCIFER: What? Detective,
what did I miss?

906
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:49,528
Who's Sheila?

907
00:33:49,561 --> 00:33:51,663
Sheila's the name of
Bobby Lowe's warm-up comedian.

908
00:33:52,831 --> 00:33:54,766
Right.

909
00:33:59,671 --> 00:34:02,774
Detective, are you sure
that Sheila's here?

910
00:34:02,808 --> 00:34:07,579
Her roommate said that she'd be
here working on new jokes, so...

911
00:34:07,613 --> 00:34:09,615
Well, I still
don't understand.

912
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:12,584
She seemed devastated when
Bobby said he was a joke thief.

913
00:34:12,618 --> 00:34:15,721
Well, maybe she's not
pissed off about the theft.

914
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:20,526
What? Well, then, what else
would she be angry about?

915
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,194
(sighs)

916
00:34:22,228 --> 00:34:24,630
Let's find out.

917
00:34:24,663 --> 00:34:26,698
Okay.

918
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:29,801
(sighs) As if these puppets
weren't creepy enough.

919
00:34:40,246 --> 00:34:41,780
Hello?

920
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:43,582
Anyone here?

921
00:34:43,615 --> 00:34:46,218
Hello?

922
00:34:46,252 --> 00:34:48,187
(sighs)

923
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:53,859
Lucifer?

924
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:58,264
(yells, laughs)

925
00:34:58,297 --> 00:35:00,432
(in deep voice):
Hello, Detective.

926
00:35:00,466 --> 00:35:03,435
(laughs):
Sorry.

927
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:06,672
Well, don't worry. At least
I don't have a gun up my bum.

928
00:35:06,705 --> 00:35:08,540
If you're not gonna
take this seriously,

929
00:35:08,574 --> 00:35:10,409
then you wait here for me.

930
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:11,743
Okay.

931
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:24,790
Okay.

932
00:35:24,823 --> 00:35:26,792
Hello?

933
00:35:26,825 --> 00:35:28,760
Anyone here?

934
00:35:30,729 --> 00:35:32,898
(metallic clattering)

935
00:35:39,438 --> 00:35:41,340
(man groans softly)

936
00:35:48,447 --> 00:35:49,848
(groans)
What, what's going on?

937
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:52,551
Is she still here?
Who? She? Sheila?

938
00:35:52,584 --> 00:35:54,386
Did she do this to you?

939
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,787
I told her I was gonna quit,

940
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:58,390
and-and she freaked out
on me, started screaming

941
00:35:58,424 --> 00:35:59,858
about everything
she-she'd done for me.

942
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:02,661
But I-I can't
take it any-anymore. My craft...

943
00:36:02,694 --> 00:36:04,930
Okay, midlife crisis
later. How long ago?

944
00:36:04,963 --> 00:36:06,832
Uh, a few minutes maybe.

945
00:36:06,865 --> 00:36:08,700
We-we heard you come in,
and then she hit me

946
00:36:08,734 --> 00:36:10,969
with the butt of her,
of her gun... in the face!

947
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,239
She has a gun?
Did-did you hear me?!

948
00:36:13,272 --> 00:36:15,807
I said, in-in the face!
This is my moneymaker!

949
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:18,577
Am I okay?
Lucifer, she's here!

950
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:19,911
No.
She's armed!

951
00:36:25,717 --> 00:36:27,386
(boards creaking)

952
00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:33,659
Why did you do
it, Sheila?

953
00:36:35,794 --> 00:36:37,863
Get out of the way!

954
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:39,265
I'm getting out of here.

955
00:36:39,298 --> 00:36:40,666
Well, once you
answer my question,

956
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,634
I'll gladly let you past.

957
00:36:42,668 --> 00:36:46,738
Why kill and torture a man
for this pretentious hack?

958
00:36:46,772 --> 00:36:50,309
Do you know how hard it is to
crawl out of the stand-up world

959
00:36:50,342 --> 00:36:51,677
and get a gig like this?

960
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,012
LUCIFER:
But he's a fellow comedian.

961
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,814
Why would you kill for someone

962
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:57,749
who stole jokes from
one of your own?

963
00:36:57,783 --> 00:36:58,950
So he stole material.

964
00:36:58,984 --> 00:37:01,953
Hell, he stole half my set, too.
Who cares?!

965
00:37:01,987 --> 00:37:03,355
LUCIFER:
You should!

966
00:37:03,389 --> 00:37:05,557
It's yours!

967
00:37:05,591 --> 00:37:07,793
One might say your
very identity.

968
00:37:07,826 --> 00:37:10,662
Jokes don't make a comedian.

969
00:37:10,696 --> 00:37:12,564
Everyone has an itchy butt joke.

970
00:37:12,598 --> 00:37:14,032
It's all about
what you do with it.

971
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,834
What you do with
your itchy butt?

972
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:18,504
With the joke!
Oh.

973
00:37:18,537 --> 00:37:20,906
So, what you're saying is,

974
00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:23,342
it's okay to steal
someone's work as long

975
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:24,610
as you do it better?

976
00:37:24,643 --> 00:37:26,945
And take me with you?
Hell yeah, it is.

977
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:28,947
Oh...
Now, if you don't
get out of my way...

978
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:32,684
I swear... (gasps)

979
00:37:32,718 --> 00:37:34,386
(grunts)

980
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,355
(sighs)

981
00:37:36,388 --> 00:37:38,557
Excellent work, Detective.

982
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,297
Okay, so... how do we get her
down from here?

983
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:54,005
Daniel?

984
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:56,442
You're not gonna throw a tomato
at me, are you?
Ugh.

985
00:37:56,475 --> 00:37:57,576
Come now, Daniel.

986
00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:00,379
I only did that for
the good of the case.
(sighs)

987
00:38:00,412 --> 00:38:02,548
Also, I ran out,
but more importantly,

988
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:03,682
did you text me to come here?

989
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:05,717
I didn't recognize the number,
so I assumed it was you.

990
00:38:05,751 --> 00:38:06,985
You didn't save my number?

991
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:08,320
PIERCE:
It was me.

992
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:20,566
Too much hard work
to break into my penthouse again

993
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:21,967
for a heart-to-heart?

994
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,570
I did some digging,
and you were right.

995
00:38:24,603 --> 00:38:25,871
The Sinnerman is here in L.A.

996
00:38:25,904 --> 00:38:27,839
Oh, right.

997
00:38:27,873 --> 00:38:29,040
Are you not gonna
take my advice

998
00:38:29,074 --> 00:38:31,877
from last night?
Most definitely not.

999
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,512
I thought so.

1000
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:40,051
You brought the Sinnerman's
murderous thug in.

1001
00:38:40,085 --> 00:38:43,121
PIERCE:
He's all yours.

1002
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,657
I couldn't get anything
out of him. Maybe you can.

1003
00:38:45,691 --> 00:38:47,926
(laughing):
Oh. Right.

1004
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:49,795
So, what, is this
you passing the baton?

1005
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:51,830
Where are you running
off to next?
Nowhere.

1006
00:38:51,863 --> 00:38:52,998
I'm seeing this through.

1007
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:55,767
But you need to shut your
damn mouth about the Sinnerman.

1008
00:38:55,801 --> 00:38:57,536
We need to play this carefully.

1009
00:38:57,569 --> 00:38:58,970
Let's keep it between us.

1010
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:00,972
(scoffs)
The less people
who know about it,

1011
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:02,641
the less chance
anyone gets hurt.

1012
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:04,876
But the detective...
Has a kid.

1013
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:07,579
She stays out of it.

1014
00:39:09,715 --> 00:39:10,949
(sighs)

1015
00:39:10,982 --> 00:39:12,751
Very well.

1016
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:17,689
(chuckles softly)

1017
00:39:25,997 --> 00:39:28,500
Hello, Alonso.

1018
00:39:28,534 --> 00:39:31,437
Let's cut to the
chase, shall we?

1019
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:34,706
I know the Sinnerman had you
skewer Sam under the pier,

1020
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,775
so tell me everything.

1021
00:39:36,808 --> 00:39:38,444
Who the hell's the Sinnerman?

1022
00:39:38,477 --> 00:39:41,079
(laughs)

1023
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:43,048
Fine.

1024
00:39:43,081 --> 00:39:45,050
Fine. Let's play
a little game, shall we?

1025
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:46,384
Look at me.

1026
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:49,788
Tell me.

1027
00:39:49,821 --> 00:39:54,426
Why did you really
desire Sam's death?

1028
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:57,829
I... didn't want my girl
to sleep with him anymore.

1029
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:02,133
And?

1030
00:40:02,167 --> 00:40:05,036
And... that's it.

1031
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:07,038
I got pissed.

1032
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:09,174
Went medieval on his ass
to send a message.

1033
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:11,543
No one touches my girl.

1034
00:40:11,577 --> 00:40:13,645
And what about the Sinnerman?

1035
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:15,781
Man, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1036
00:40:15,814 --> 00:40:17,616
Oh, you must know.
Come on, Alonso.

1037
00:40:17,649 --> 00:40:19,050
What about the Sinnerman?

1038
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:20,719
I don't know.

1039
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,588
You must know!

1040
00:40:24,523 --> 00:40:26,592
I don't know
anything... I swear.

1041
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,029
(swallows hard)

1042
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:33,965
I believe you.

1043
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,806
LUCIFER:
He was telling the truth.

1044
00:40:40,839 --> 00:40:42,608
I mean, maybe

1045
00:40:42,641 --> 00:40:45,210
the Sinnerman manipulated Alonso
without him realizing it.

1046
00:40:45,243 --> 00:40:48,146
Or perhaps he was just
a deranged fellow who felt

1047
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:50,616
impaling a rival lover to death
was the way to his girl's heart.

1048
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:54,986
It's a bit old-fashioned,
really.

1049
00:40:56,722 --> 00:40:58,857
Lucifer, I want
to talk about your wings.

1050
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:01,126
Oh, bloody hell.
They're not out again?!

1051
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:03,194
So they grew back?

1052
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,998
They did... this morning.

1053
00:41:07,032 --> 00:41:08,934
Sneaky buggers.

1054
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:11,503
You can't keep doing this
to yourself.
Oh, I agree.

1055
00:41:11,537 --> 00:41:13,772
You do?
Yes.

1056
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:16,775
It's getting exhausting...
and quite messy.

1057
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:19,077
No, I need a new solution.

1058
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:21,847
Maybe I should hire someone
to do it.

1059
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,883
Or maybe your solution is

1060
00:41:24,916 --> 00:41:28,554
to accept that, for now,
you have wings again.

1061
00:41:28,587 --> 00:41:32,157
What, and let Dad win,
or whoever it bloody is?

1062
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,125
I... I don't think so.

1063
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:39,798
It's easy to let
external factors... define us.

1064
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,232
(clock ticking)

1065
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:43,201
Especially the traumatic ones.

1066
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:47,172
But only if we let them.

1067
00:41:50,275 --> 00:41:52,578
We all have itchy butts.

1068
00:41:52,611 --> 00:41:53,945
Excuse me?

1069
00:41:53,979 --> 00:41:55,547
No, it's just something
a woman said to me

1070
00:41:55,581 --> 00:41:56,915
right before
I punched her in the face.

1071
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:01,086
It's not about the idea.
It's about the execution.

1072
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,154
It's about how I use the wings.

1073
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:05,757
That's... actually...

1074
00:42:05,791 --> 00:42:07,759
pretty wise.

1075
00:42:07,793 --> 00:42:09,294
Yeah. So I'll just
tuck them away

1076
00:42:09,327 --> 00:42:11,162
and pretend they don't exist.
Less good.

1077
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:13,098
Someone else is giving favors.
Who cares?

1078
00:42:14,232 --> 00:42:16,201
I'm Lucifer bloody Morningstar!

1079
00:42:16,234 --> 00:42:18,236
I do favors better
than anyone else.

1080
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:22,040
Amongst other things,
of course.

1081
00:42:22,073 --> 00:42:24,142
Or at least, I used to.

1082
00:42:24,175 --> 00:42:26,277
And I think that maybe...

1083
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:29,915
...it's about time
I got back in the game.

1084
00:42:29,948 --> 00:42:31,983
*

1085
00:42:33,852 --> 00:42:35,721
* Please me

1086
00:42:35,754 --> 00:42:40,125
* Oh, won't you
ever please me? *

1087
00:42:40,158 --> 00:42:45,230
* You will give me the faith
and I'll bring it on *

1088
00:42:45,263 --> 00:42:48,133
* There's a way
through the storm. *

1089
00:42:55,841 --> 00:42:58,209
Hello.

1090
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:05,817
So, tell me. What is it
that you truly desire?
