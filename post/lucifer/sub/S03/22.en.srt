00:00:03,438 --> 00:00:04,917
and my test.
So what's the plan?

3
00:00:04,961 --> 00:00:05,918
We need to make

4
00:00:05,962 --> 00:00:07,050
the detective realize

5
00:00:07,094 --> 00:00:08,225
that Pierce isn't the man

6
00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:09,226
she thinks he is.

7
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:10,575
If we don't get Chloe
to love you,

8
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:12,055
then I can't kill you,

9
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:14,884
and I need this
to get back to Hell.

10
00:00:14,927 --> 00:00:16,103
I like you, Charlotte.

11
00:00:16,146 --> 00:00:17,626
So, if you need
time, I can wait.

12
00:00:17,669 --> 00:00:19,106
You're worth it.

13
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:20,237
What do you desire?

14
00:00:20,281 --> 00:00:23,588
I want her to choose me.Then tell her.

15
00:00:23,632 --> 00:00:25,242
Chloe Decker,
will you marry me?

16
00:00:25,286 --> 00:00:27,070
Yes.

do you not understand?

I'm not talking

No, I am talking about
the bachelorette party.

second wedding.

you're gonna need one

Uh, Decker.

70
00:02:19,661 --> 00:02:22,751
All of my life,
I have been dreaming

71
00:02:22,794 --> 00:02:24,579
of the chance to plan
a bachelorette party.

72
00:02:24,622 --> 00:02:26,015
But four brothers.

73
00:02:26,058 --> 00:02:27,495
Remember?

74
00:02:27,538 --> 00:02:30,062
And you're the closest thing
I have to a sister right now.

75
00:02:30,106 --> 00:02:32,152
Well... [sighs]

76
00:02:32,195 --> 00:02:34,023
I guess if you're gonna
play the sister card.

77
00:02:34,066 --> 00:02:35,372
Yes!

78
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:36,678
Oh, wait.
Let's talk theme.

79
00:02:36,721 --> 00:02:39,594
The bachelorette
and wedding should match.

80
00:02:39,637 --> 00:02:44,860
You know, color palette, dress,
cake, venue, flowers...

81
00:02:44,903 --> 00:02:47,210
Playlist, DJ, tuxedo,

82
00:02:47,254 --> 00:02:48,690
marriage license.Right.

83
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:50,213
We have the nice bottle

84
00:02:50,257 --> 00:02:51,606
of single malt for the bar,

85
00:02:51,649 --> 00:02:53,042
which is gonna be open,

86
00:02:53,085 --> 00:02:55,087
which means we need to
get a couple bartenders.

87
00:02:56,132 --> 00:02:57,438
This is a lot, isn't it?

88
00:02:57,481 --> 00:02:59,875
It's, uh... [chuckles]

89
00:02:59,918 --> 00:03:02,094
Do you think we should maybe
postpone the date?

90
00:03:02,138 --> 00:03:03,052
Is that what you want?

91
00:03:03,095 --> 00:03:04,445
No. No.

92
00:03:04,488 --> 00:03:06,142
Totally and completely no.

93
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,622
I-- unless...

94
00:03:07,665 --> 00:03:09,711
unless you do.Absolutely not.

95
00:03:09,754 --> 00:03:12,104
I've never been more sure
of anything in my life.

96
00:03:14,585 --> 00:03:16,631
I mean, look, we solve murders.

97
00:03:16,674 --> 00:03:18,894
How hard can it be
to plan one little wedding?Yeah.

98
00:03:18,937 --> 00:03:20,548
But I think I know what'll help.

99
00:03:20,591 --> 00:03:22,245
Hmm?I recently discovered
that a certain detective

100
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:24,943
has weeks
of unused vacation days.

101
00:03:24,987 --> 00:03:28,120
Couple days away from the office
might give you time to plan.

102
00:03:29,992 --> 00:03:32,560
Chloe said yes?

103
00:03:32,603 --> 00:03:34,736
To marry Pierce?It's mind-boggling,

104
00:03:34,779 --> 00:03:36,390
I know.

105
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:37,782
I mean,
when I said I was at peace

106
00:03:37,826 --> 00:03:39,567
with the detective
making her own choices,

107
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,221
it didn't occur to me

108
00:03:41,264 --> 00:03:44,441
that she'd be capable of making
such a spectacularly bad one.

109
00:03:44,485 --> 00:03:45,747
I mean,

110
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,096
why on earth?

111
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:48,750
Why is besides
the point, Luci.

112
00:03:48,793 --> 00:03:50,099
We can't allow this to happen.

113
00:03:50,142 --> 00:03:53,581
Oh, I like this new you.

114
00:03:53,624 --> 00:03:55,931
I wish you'd realized
I was your test eons ago.

115
00:03:55,974 --> 00:03:57,672
Luci, it is God's will that you

116
00:03:57,715 --> 00:03:58,977
and Chloe...Yeah, don't ruin it.

117
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:00,283
I'm just happy

118
00:04:00,327 --> 00:04:02,416
that we're on the same side
for once.

119
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,331
So, what's the plan?

120
00:04:04,374 --> 00:04:07,377
The plan... is simple.

121
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:08,770
The plan is simple.

122
00:04:08,813 --> 00:04:10,424
I'm going to try
to understand why

123
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:12,121
the detective
would want to marry

124
00:04:12,164 --> 00:04:13,296
that overstuffed man ham

125
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,603
and then make her see
she's deranged.

126
00:04:15,646 --> 00:04:17,605
Or you could just tell her
how you feel.

127
00:04:17,648 --> 00:04:21,696
I already missed my window
for that, unfortunately.

128
00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:24,220
He's weaseled his way
into her heart,

129
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,048
and I don't understand how,

130
00:04:26,091 --> 00:04:28,006
but I need to.

131
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,443
Well, good luck.

132
00:04:29,486 --> 00:04:31,793
And I will come up with a plan
that will actually work.

133
00:04:31,836 --> 00:04:32,924
Of course you will.

134
00:04:32,968 --> 00:04:35,187
[chuckles]

135
00:04:35,231 --> 00:04:36,624
Ah, Detective.

136
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:38,321
You look nice.Thank you.

137
00:04:38,365 --> 00:04:40,889
Uh, anyway, since
changes are afoot,

138
00:04:40,932 --> 00:04:42,760
I'd like to address
things head-on.

139
00:04:42,804 --> 00:04:45,981
Oh. Well,
that's oddly mature of you.

140
00:04:46,024 --> 00:04:47,983
And it's... it's nice to know

141
00:04:48,026 --> 00:04:49,724
that you're not gonna start
acting all weird.

142
00:04:49,767 --> 00:04:52,944
[laughs, exhales]

143
00:04:52,988 --> 00:04:55,991
Oh, what's this?
Is this an engagement gift?

144
00:04:56,034 --> 00:04:57,819
It's much better than that.
It's a personality test.

145
00:04:57,862 --> 00:05:00,212
So I can understand why
you do the things you do

146
00:05:00,256 --> 00:05:02,650
and, uh, decide
the things you decide.

147
00:05:02,693 --> 00:05:03,868
A personality test?

148
00:05:03,912 --> 00:05:05,348
So much for not acting weird.

149
00:05:05,392 --> 00:05:08,003
What? You know, to help
optimize our partnership.

150
00:05:08,046 --> 00:05:09,483
Okay, well,
it's gonna have to wait,

151
00:05:09,526 --> 00:05:11,833
because I am taking some
time off to plan the wedding.

152
00:05:11,876 --> 00:05:15,184
I... Well, how am I supposed
to get inside your head

153
00:05:15,227 --> 00:05:16,664
if I can't watch you at work?

154
00:05:16,707 --> 00:05:18,840
The job is who you are,
Detective.

155
00:05:18,883 --> 00:05:20,145
Well, how about

156
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:21,364
you watch Dan.

157
00:05:21,408 --> 00:05:23,366
Because my cases
have been reassigned,

158
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,325
and I'm sure
he'd appreciate the help.

159
00:05:28,415 --> 00:05:31,243
Well, looks like it's
you and me, Lucinda.

160
00:05:32,897 --> 00:05:34,856
Yippee.

161
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:36,248
♪

162
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:42,864
And then there's
potential reason number 54...55.

163
00:05:42,907 --> 00:05:46,302
...55 the detective would accept
Pierce's proposal: drugs.

164
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,435
EUI-- Engaged
Under the Influence.

165
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:49,827
Or craziest reason yet:

166
00:05:49,871 --> 00:05:52,090
maybe Chloe said yes
because it's what she wants.

167
00:05:52,134 --> 00:05:53,527
Well, maybe it's what
she thinks she wants,

168
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,224
but does she know
what she truly desires?

169
00:05:55,267 --> 00:05:57,008
'Cause few do
unless I help them.

170

I can't do that with her.

Not peony, penis.

172
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:05,408
Peni... Yeah, sure, I'll hold.

173
00:06:05,452 --> 00:06:07,410

176
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:12,763
Well, aren't you gonna ask

177
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:14,069
about these suspicious
paw prints?

178
00:06:14,112 --> 00:06:15,200
The detective
certainly would.

179
00:06:15,244 --> 00:06:16,463
ELLA:
The prints belong

180
00:06:16,506 --> 00:06:18,421
to Cornelia,
the vic's prizewinning Mastiff.

181
00:06:18,465 --> 00:06:19,596
Currently AWOL, though.

182
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,555
Ah, right. A canine killer.

183
00:06:21,598 --> 00:06:24,558
Seems they can't trust you
with a real homicide, Daniel.Nope.

184
00:06:24,601 --> 00:06:26,081
The bitch is innocent.

185
00:06:26,124 --> 00:06:28,257
Cause of death
was blunt force trauma,

186
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,650
so the killer is human.

187
00:06:29,693 --> 00:06:30,738
You can rush the order?

188
00:06:30,781 --> 00:06:32,435
Awesome!

189
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,915
Okay.

190
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:34,916
It's all in here.

191
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:35,917
Oh.I got me

192
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,875
a penis piñata to pick up.

193
00:06:39,137 --> 00:06:40,530
[clears throat]

194
00:06:40,574 --> 00:06:42,227
Right, well, by now,
the detective

195
00:06:42,271 --> 00:06:44,447
would have formulated
a working theory, so...Listen, dude.

196
00:06:44,491 --> 00:06:46,144
I know you're
going through stuff

197
00:06:46,188 --> 00:06:47,929
with this whole
Chloe-getting-engaged thing,

198
00:06:47,972 --> 00:06:50,279
but I can't have you
second-guessing my every move.

199
00:06:50,322 --> 00:06:52,412
Chloe has her reasons for making
the decisions that she makes,

200
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:53,848
and I have mine.

201
00:06:53,891 --> 00:06:55,763
Only one of us can be detective.

202
00:06:55,806 --> 00:06:57,765
You're right.Yeah.

203
00:06:57,808 --> 00:07:01,116
That is the perfect way to
understand the detective.

204
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:03,858
I'm gonna take the
lead and be her.

205
00:07:04,815 --> 00:07:05,947
Right.

206
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,645
That is not what I meant.

207
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:10,691
♪

208
00:07:19,003 --> 00:07:21,049
Francis loved the beach.

209
00:07:21,092 --> 00:07:23,617
We just celebrated our sixth
wedding anniversary in Malibu.

210
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,662
Two daddies and one fur baby.

211
00:07:27,011 --> 00:07:28,752
Has there been any sign of her?

212
00:07:28,796 --> 00:07:30,493
Cornelia's all I have left.

213
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:33,757
Not yet, but my job
means everything to me.

214
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:36,151
Solving murders is
my one true passion,

215
00:07:36,194 --> 00:07:39,676
and as such, I promise you
that I will find Cornelia

216
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,331
and get justice
for your slaughtered husband...

217
00:07:42,374 --> 00:07:44,289
because I am empathetic.

218
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,334
I care.

219
00:07:45,377 --> 00:07:46,814
Yeah.

220
00:07:46,857 --> 00:07:50,208
Will you excuse us for
just a second, please?

221
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,516
Thought you never lied.

222
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,170
What? I do care...

223
00:07:55,213 --> 00:07:57,346
about channeling
the detective

224
00:07:57,389 --> 00:07:59,043
so I can find out why she does
the things she does

225
00:07:59,087 --> 00:08:00,523
and makes the decisions
she makes.Okay, look.

226
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:02,525
Whatever it is,
we still have to do our job.

227
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:04,701
You know, like asking questions
relating to the crime.

228
00:08:04,745 --> 00:08:06,529
Okay? Just let me
handle this.
[sighs]

229
00:08:06,573 --> 00:08:08,531
[clears throat] Uh, Frederick?

230
00:08:08,575 --> 00:08:10,838
Do you know of anyone who
had a beef with Francis?

231
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:12,013
Anyone who would want
to hurt him?

232
00:08:12,056 --> 00:08:13,014
Oh, right, that is exactly

233
00:08:13,057 --> 00:08:14,319
the sort of futile question

234
00:08:14,363 --> 00:08:15,669
the detective would ask.

235
00:08:15,712 --> 00:08:17,322
Do you?I mean,

236
00:08:17,366 --> 00:08:19,368
everyone loved Francis.

237
00:08:20,717 --> 00:08:23,851
But he did get into an argument
with someone in the parking lot

238
00:08:23,894 --> 00:08:25,679
of the training center
last week.

239
00:08:25,722 --> 00:08:27,681
Did you get a name?No, I...

240
00:08:27,724 --> 00:08:29,334
I thought they were just arguing
about a parking spot.

241
00:08:29,378 --> 00:08:31,119
But I did take down
the license plate

242
00:08:31,162 --> 00:08:34,209
in case he came back
to key the car...

243
00:08:34,252 --> 00:08:35,689
if that's helpful?

244
00:08:35,732 --> 00:08:36,864
Is that helpful?

245
00:08:36,907 --> 00:08:37,995
Yeah.

246
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,562
Right. Thank you.

247
00:08:39,606 --> 00:08:40,694
I got your message

248
00:08:40,737 --> 00:08:41,869
about the engagement.

249
00:08:41,912 --> 00:08:43,174
Plan's back on, right?

250
00:08:43,218 --> 00:08:44,306
Whoa, easy, there.

251
00:08:44,349 --> 00:08:46,003
Oh, relax.
I'm not gonna do it here.

252
00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:47,744
I mean, I remember the plan.

253
00:08:47,788 --> 00:08:50,355
Kill you, frame Lucifer,
blah, blah, blah.

254
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,358
I'm just really excited.

255
00:08:53,402 --> 00:08:54,838
Well, that's not
why I called you.

256
00:08:54,882 --> 00:08:56,187
I called to apologize.

257
00:08:56,231 --> 00:08:58,015
Apologize about what?

258
00:08:58,059 --> 00:08:59,451
I don't want to die anymore.

259
00:09:00,714 --> 00:09:02,585
I'm in love with Chloe.
I want to be with her.

260
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:04,587
I-I know you
don't understand.

261
00:09:04,631 --> 00:09:06,981
I hardly do, myself.

262
00:09:07,024 --> 00:09:09,070
You know, I've never
felt like this before.

263
00:09:09,113 --> 00:09:11,159
We had a deal!And I will honor it.

264
00:09:11,202 --> 00:09:13,596
I promise to find you
another way back to Hell.

265
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,424
Show me your arm.

266
00:09:15,467 --> 00:09:16,643
Really?

267
00:09:20,472 --> 00:09:22,910
I don't get it.

268
00:09:22,953 --> 00:09:24,564
If Decker loves you,

269
00:09:24,607 --> 00:09:25,913
then the mark should be gone.

270
00:09:27,262 --> 00:09:29,220
Unless she's having
second thoughts about you.

271
00:09:29,264 --> 00:09:30,744
Well, that's not...

Oh, my God.

Maze, super psyched you're here.

I got me
what you might call

275
00:09:36,314 --> 00:09:39,100
an "all hands on Decker"
emergency.

276
00:09:39,143 --> 00:09:41,189
Would you...?Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Conference room.Yeah.

278
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:49,458
I'll work on Chloe
and get her back on board.

00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:50,938
In the meantime,

280
00:09:50,981 --> 00:09:53,331
you better figure out
that other way...

281
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,464
fast.

00:09:57,466 --> 00:09:59,337

I am just trying to
stay organized here.

Wow. Mug shot for the caterer.

286
00:10:05,126 --> 00:10:06,214
Nice work, Decker.

You see what I'm dealing with?Mm-hmm.

288
00:10:07,781 --> 00:10:10,435
Guys, solving crimes
makes sense to me.

289
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:12,089
Wedding stuff, not so much.

290
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:13,787
Why do you think Dan and I
got married at the courthouse

291
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,005
and then went right back
to work?

292
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:16,833
Decker, trust me,

293
00:10:16,877 --> 00:10:19,488
we will help you deal
with all the wedding details

294
00:10:19,531 --> 00:10:20,707
the normal way:

295
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,752
blind drunk
at your bachelorette party.

296
00:10:22,796 --> 00:10:25,189
Mm-hmm.Which needs to be awesome.

297
00:10:25,233 --> 00:10:26,451
That's where you come in

298
00:10:26,495 --> 00:10:28,323
while I deal with a
new lead in this case.

299
00:10:28,366 --> 00:10:29,759
Oh, the case. Right.

300
00:10:29,803 --> 00:10:31,805
What's going on with that?I-I ran a partial license

301
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:33,197
and got a match.

302
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:35,373
Security footage
shows the suspect's car

303
00:10:35,417 --> 00:10:36,679
at the location of the murder.

304
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:37,985
Okay, who is it registered to?

305
00:10:38,028 --> 00:10:39,203
You will never know that

306
00:10:39,247 --> 00:10:41,553
because you are
on wedding vacay.

307
00:10:41,597 --> 00:10:43,077
All right.
[groans] My dress.

308
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,774
I need to get a dress.Yep. Mm-hmm.

309
00:10:44,818 --> 00:10:46,036
And while you do that...

310
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,864
We will...

311
00:10:47,908 --> 00:10:49,170
seal this wedding dealio

312
00:10:49,213 --> 00:10:51,825
by throwing you
a bachelorette party

313
00:10:51,868 --> 00:10:53,348
you won't forget.

314
00:10:53,391 --> 00:10:54,784
Thanks.

315
00:10:54,828 --> 00:10:56,003
I think.

316
00:10:58,222 --> 00:11:01,835
Perfect. Okay, so you plan the
pregame till I get off of work.

317
00:11:01,878 --> 00:11:03,010
Mm-hmm.
Oh, my God.

318
00:11:03,053 --> 00:11:04,141
With you on the case,

319
00:11:04,185 --> 00:11:06,404

321
00:11:12,323 --> 00:11:13,977
Yes, we're heading
there right now.

322
00:11:14,021 --> 00:11:15,762
Actually, we would've been there
20 minutes ago

323
00:11:15,805 --> 00:11:17,851
if someone didn't have to stop
for a wardrobe change.

324
00:11:17,894 --> 00:11:19,591
I'm committed, Daniel.

325
00:11:19,635 --> 00:11:22,116
Okay, so, uh, Ella tracked
the plate of the guy

00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:25,162
Francis fought with to an ex-con
named Vincent Walker.

327
00:11:25,206 --> 00:11:28,209
Car was spotted on 3rd and Main.
So we should, you know, hurry.

328
00:11:28,252 --> 00:11:29,558
Well, I'm going as fast
as I can.

329
00:11:29,601 --> 00:11:31,734
You're going 34 in a 35, man.[horn honks]

330
00:11:31,778 --> 00:11:34,128
I can't risk accidentally
going over the speed limit.

331
00:11:34,171 --> 00:11:35,695
The detective wouldn't.

332
00:11:35,738 --> 00:11:39,046
Why don't you just ask Chloe
why she said yes to Pierce?

333
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:43,441
Oh, there's no point bothering
the detective on her time off.

334
00:11:43,485 --> 00:11:46,227
But speaking of
baffling unions,

335
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,838
how are you doing? You and
Charlotte still a thing?

336
00:11:48,882 --> 00:11:51,493
Oh, I...[horn honks]

337
00:11:51,536 --> 00:11:54,322
Yeah, she's kind of going
through some stuff right now.

338
00:11:54,365 --> 00:11:56,672
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.And I'm just...

339
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,195
you know, I'm giving her space.Right.

340
00:11:58,239 --> 00:11:59,370
Or I'm trying to.
Hmm.

341
00:11:59,414 --> 00:12:01,068
But thank you for caring, man.

342
00:12:01,111 --> 00:12:02,634
Oh, no, I don't care.

343
00:12:02,678 --> 00:12:05,768
Oh, right, right,
but Chloe would.[horn honks]

344
00:12:05,812 --> 00:12:07,770
Now you're
getting it, Daniel.

345
00:12:07,814 --> 00:12:09,163
Just drive, man.

346
00:12:09,206 --> 00:12:10,381

347
00:12:14,646 --> 00:12:17,084
Hey, Amenadiel.

348
00:12:17,127 --> 00:12:19,260
This a bad time?I could use a break

349
00:12:19,303 --> 00:12:21,610
from prosecuting the
Malibu State water polo team.

350
00:12:21,653 --> 00:12:22,959
Well, I was hoping
that you might be able

351
00:12:23,003 --> 00:12:24,308
to help me out again.

352
00:12:24,352 --> 00:12:26,789
I know we failed to prove
Pierce is The Sinnerman,

353
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,791
but I've still been digging,

354
00:12:28,835 --> 00:12:31,576
and I am confident
that eventually...

355
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,796
Actually, I'm taking a different
angle this time, Charlotte.

356
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,624
I need to split up
the engagement

that marrying a...

966

Cornelia's prenatal examination
was signed by Frederick,

980
00:36:35,671 --> 00:36:39,458
but he said he didn't know
about the pregnancy.

981
00:36:39,501 --> 00:36:42,417
And the signature's a match.

982

Which means he lied.

I don't know.

1068

Got a lot of things on my mind.

1069
00:40:46,095 --> 00:40:47,967
Could be kind of serious.

[chuckles]:
Tell me about it.

1071
00:40:49,969 --> 00:40:52,101
I am-- whew--

we've been keeping things
kind of loose,

1078
00:41:08,553 --> 00:41:11,686
and I said that you
could use your space.

And if that's
what you want...

if that's what you truly want,
then I respect that.

1081

But... I never told you
what Iwant.

1082
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:28,616
I want you.
