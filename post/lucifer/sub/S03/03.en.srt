1
00:00:01,402 --> 00:00:03,071
Previously on Lucifer...
MAZE: But I didn't

2
00:00:03,104 --> 00:00:05,106
leave Hell to be a bartender.

3
00:00:05,139 --> 00:00:07,375
LUCIFER:
You exist to protect me.

4
00:00:07,408 --> 00:00:08,142
MAZE:
Whatever the danger,

5
00:00:08,176 --> 00:00:09,543
I'll be there to stop it.

6
00:00:09,577 --> 00:00:11,045
Now that we are stuck here,

7
00:00:11,079 --> 00:00:13,181
I need to figure out
where I fit in.

8
00:00:13,214 --> 00:00:14,315
MAZE:
I got paid.

9
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:15,383
As a bounty hunter.

10
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:17,185
I need you to help me.

11
00:00:17,218 --> 00:00:19,387
I'd have Maze do it,
but she's off bounty hunting.

12
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,055
Demons don't have a soul.

13
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:24,092
If I die, I just... die.

14
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:27,128
*

15
00:00:33,101 --> 00:00:36,837
* Body snatchers
and karma catchers *

16
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,674
* They pitter-patter
through the night *

17
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:44,345
* Money-loving, a dime a dozen

18
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,447
* But hey, now

19
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,849
* All we want to do is dance

20
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:52,553
* Payphone preachers
and twisted creatures *

21
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:56,124
* On TV clawing out
your eyes... *

22
00:00:56,157 --> 00:00:57,625
Ah.

23
00:00:57,658 --> 00:00:59,593
How do you do
this every night?

24
00:00:59,627 --> 00:01:00,694
How do you not?

25
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:02,463
Fear of liver failure, mostly.

26
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:04,165
(laughs)

27
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:06,134
We've been drinking
for three hours.

28
00:01:06,167 --> 00:01:07,301
But I know
you've been going since...

29
00:01:07,335 --> 00:01:08,869
Tuesday.

30
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,305
Why do you always
push yourself like this?

31
00:01:11,339 --> 00:01:13,807
Because it's fun, Linda.

32
00:01:13,841 --> 00:01:15,776
No rest for
the soulless.

33
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,781
Okay.

34
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,816
I've been meaning to
ask you about that.

35
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,286
You can't really mean
that you don't have a soul.

36
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,787
Ah, that she does.

37
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,722
No demons have souls.

38
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:31,825
That's why they're notorious
for living in the moment.

39
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:33,227
Yeah, when I die, that's it.

40
00:01:33,261 --> 00:01:34,562
Maze out.

41
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,264
So don't waste a single second.

42
00:01:36,297 --> 00:01:37,831
You humans could learn
a thing from her.

43
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:40,234
And me. Well, mostly me.

44
00:01:40,268 --> 00:01:41,502
(slurring):
That's terrible.

45
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:43,337
I'm so sorry, Maze.

46
00:01:43,371 --> 00:01:44,638
I have no complaints.

47
00:01:44,672 --> 00:01:46,440
I just try and keep things
interesting.

48
00:01:46,474 --> 00:01:49,377
I mean, I was getting
a little bored with the constant

49
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,611
drinking,

50
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:52,446
violence, sex.

51
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,847
You know how it is.

52
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:55,283
Yes, of course.

53
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:58,252
All those things,
all the time, for me.

54
00:01:58,286 --> 00:01:59,720
Yeah, but now
I hunt humans, too.

55
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:01,355
Adds a little spice to things.

56
00:02:01,389 --> 00:02:05,293
In fact, my next bounty
should be here any minute.

57
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:07,461
You got your bounty
to come to you?
Mm-hmm.

58
00:02:07,495 --> 00:02:09,297
How'd you pull that off?
(chuckles) Let me
guess. Blackmail.

59
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,898
No. Promise of a threesome.

60
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:13,467
(chuckles) Drink coupon to Lux.

61
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:14,468
Coupon?

62
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:16,337
(chuckles)

63
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,805
Maze, this isn't
some sort of student disco.

64
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:19,540
No one in their right mind...
MAN: I have a coupon

65
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:20,741
for a free margarita.

66
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:22,543
Oh.

67
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,248
MAZE:
Yeah.

68
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:30,184
Though I have to admit,
the job is losing its thrill.

69
00:02:30,218 --> 00:02:31,852
I don't know.

70
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:35,389
I think I need... more.

71
00:02:35,423 --> 00:02:39,227
Maybe you should take a breath

72
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,895
and appreciate
all that you have.

73
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:43,497
Slow down.

74
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:45,366
Like I wish
this spinning room would.

75
00:02:47,368 --> 00:02:48,369
The room's not spinning, is it?

76
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:49,370
No.
No.

77
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:50,371
No. Okay.

78
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:51,672
Oh, this is cold.

79
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:53,507
This is cold and nice.

80
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:54,708
Don't listen to her.

81
00:02:54,742 --> 00:02:56,744
You take it
from me, Maze.

82
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:58,879
The best thing to do is always
to follow your greatest desire.

83
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,782
Burn brighter, Mazikeen.

84
00:03:01,815 --> 00:03:04,885
You should hunt the most
challenging human you can.

85
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,588
Sure the doctor will agree.

86
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:08,856
(moans)

87
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:10,224
Once she wakes up.

88
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:16,697
Burn brighter it is.

89
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,299
Game on. (chuckles)

90
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:20,234
Cheers.

91
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:24,538
* And all we want to do
is dance. *

92
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:27,408
They were both screaming.

93
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:30,744
He didn't even seem to notice.

94
00:03:30,778 --> 00:03:33,781
He killed them
like it was nothing.

95
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:40,421
There was so much blood.

96
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:41,889
I'll never forget...

97
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:43,491
Excuse me.

98
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:46,794
Is this your office?

99
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:48,462
Nope.

100
00:03:48,496 --> 00:03:50,331
Uh, didn't think so.

101
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:53,367
Pretty sure it's mine.

102
00:03:53,401 --> 00:03:55,002
This is the part

103
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:57,371
where you explain what the hell
you're doing at my desk.

104
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:03,811
You're, uh...

105
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:06,914
Lieutenant Herrera
of Organized Crime.

106
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:08,616
Yeah, I am.

107
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:10,384
Was it the "at my desk" part
that clued you in?

108
00:04:10,418 --> 00:04:12,753
What are you doing
looking at old interviews

109
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:14,588
of the Ben Rivers case?

110
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:16,357
I want to find him.

111
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,991
What are you, an old
girlfriend or something?

112
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:19,827
(chuckles)

113
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,829
I'm Mazikeen Smith.

114
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:23,797
Oh.

115
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:25,499
You're that bounty hunter
that works with Homicide.

116
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:27,368
Impressive record.

117
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:29,937
This says that Rivers
was in a small town in Canada

118
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,039
a couple weeks ago.

119
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:34,342
Yeah, he's been moving around
for the last couple months.

120
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:37,311
Always three steps ahead of
whoever's gone after him.

121
00:04:37,345 --> 00:04:38,846
Not anymore.

122
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,416
Listen, if you're serious
about this,

123
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,319
you need to know that
Rivers is manipulative.

124
00:04:45,353 --> 00:04:46,454
He's dangerous.

125
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:47,688
Oh, does he know kung fu?

126
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,690
(chuckles) Uh...

127
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:50,958
I don't think so.

128
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:53,494
Mm. Too bad.

129
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:55,429
You were getting me excited.

130
00:04:55,463 --> 00:04:56,530
Don't.

131
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:00,468
Don't underestimate him.

132
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:01,869
All right?
He's killed two people

133
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:03,471
in broad daylight
because he felt like it.

134
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:05,406
Who knows what
else he's done?

135
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,808
Every bounty hunter who's
ever gone after him has failed.

136
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:10,010
(chuckles softly)

137
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,945
(whispers):
Perfect.

138
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,386
Maze, really?

139
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:20,821
Do you even know what you're
getting yourself into?

140
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:22,823
Uh, h-have you even
been to Canada?

141
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:24,392
No. Come on.

142
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:25,393
Same humans,
different city.

143
00:05:25,426 --> 00:05:27,395
Country.

144
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:29,863
Canada's a country, and it's
very different from here.

145
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:32,600
Okay, this, this is not

146
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:34,402
cold-weather clothing.
Yeah.

147
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:35,969
You know it's winter
there, right?

148
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,471
What's this? Is this
your cold-weather gear?

149
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:38,939
No, that's my whips and knives.

150
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:40,841
Uh...

151
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,745
Well, your whips and
knives are moving.

152
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:52,520
(exhales)

153
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:54,488
Trixie.

154
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:57,591
I can't let Maze
go alone.

155
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:00,828
Someone needs
to cover her back.

156
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,531
Thanks, little human.

157
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:05,065
No.

158
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:08,736
(sighs) Listen,
I'm gonna be okay.

159
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:11,004
Besides, I need you

160
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:13,173
(whispering): to stay here
and watch your mom.

161
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,775
(whispering):
That's true.

162
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:17,978
Without the two of us,
she's defenseless.

163
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:20,448
(whispering):
I don't know if I like
what you're whispering about.

164
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:25,719
Here. Take Miss Alien
with you, at least.

165
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:28,456
Knuckles.

166
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,093
(both growl)

167
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,463
Ugh. Come on.

168
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,133
Good luck, Maze.

169
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:42,202
Get some while I'm gone,
won't you, Decker?

170
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,504
(sighs)

171
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:49,643
Hey, Monkey.
(door opens)

172
00:06:49,677 --> 00:06:50,778
Maze is gonna be
just fine.

173
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:52,112
(door closes)

174
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:54,782
Then why do you look
worried about her?

175
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:58,218
I'm not worried about Maze.
I'm worried about Canada.

176
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,688
*

177
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:06,960
* Whoa, oh, whoa, oh

178
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:08,228
* Hey *

179
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,598
* Whoa, oh, whoa

180
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:12,232
* Whoa, oh, whoa, oh...

181
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,201
(shudders)

182
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:19,873
(whoops, laughs)

183
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:23,143
* Can't stop me now *

184
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:24,812
(laughing)

185
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:26,814
* Can't stop me now *

186
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:28,048
(exhales)

187
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:29,750
* Whoa, oh, whoa, oh...

188
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,519
BOY (muffled):
Help!

189
00:07:31,552 --> 00:07:33,654
Hey, give me my coat!

190
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:36,824
Hey! Come back here! Help!

191
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:38,526
* Can't stop me now. *

192
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:40,460
*

193
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,539
Mm-hmm.

194
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:53,173
Yeah, that sounds like her.

195
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:54,074
Thanks.

196
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:55,776
Hey, hey, hey.

197
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,177
Someone's ready
for their vacation.

198
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,712
Ah, so ready.

199
00:07:58,746 --> 00:08:00,180
This is my itinerary.

200
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,716
I will be available
by phone at all times.

201
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,951
If anything happens to Trixie,

202
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,553
I'll be on
the first flight back.

203
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:06,620
LUCIFER:
Daniel.

204
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:08,021
Where are you off to? The '80s?

205
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:09,657
Ha. Nice one. Hawaii.

206
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,091
(chuckles)

207
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:13,694
I want you to enjoy Hawaii,
okay? You deserve it.

208
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:15,028
Thank you. Finally got
enough points together.

209
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:17,097
No crime scenes,
no paperwork.

210
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,633
I'm just gonna surf, I'm gonna
do a little bit of hiking,

211
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:20,768
and I'm gonna read a book.

212
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:21,869
Good.
Self-help, I assume.

213
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:23,236
Any man who chooses
three layovers

214
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,138
is clearly torturing himself.

215
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,774
I had to use travel points, man.
Not everyone has cash to burn.

216
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:28,642
Well, you should.
I mean, sometimes

217
00:08:28,676 --> 00:08:30,678
I'll just light it on fire
and throw it up in the air

218
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:32,145
to see who...

219
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,081
That was a turn of phrase,
wasn't it?

220
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:35,949
Yeah.

221
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:38,085
Well, I'm gonna catch you guys
in a couple weeks.

222
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:39,587
I'm out.
Have fun!

223
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,723
LUCIFER:
Ooh, goody.

224
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:44,758
New dots.

225
00:08:44,792 --> 00:08:46,727
So, where have you tracked Maze
tracking her bounty to now?

226
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,797
Yeah, okay.
A taxi theft in Vancouver.

227
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,132
A brawl with a curling team
in Montreal.

228
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:54,768
Oh, and the, uh, "bear attack"
that happened

229
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:57,270
in Prince Edward Island
I think was her, too.

230
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:58,639
Sounds like she's having
a splendid time.

231
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:00,708
I'm glad I suggested it.

232
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:02,309
So you're the reason
Canada's in danger?

233
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:03,744
Look, this is good
for Maze, Detective.

234
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:05,679
She needs a change of pace.

235
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:08,816
What Maze needs is our help
before she does any more damage.

236
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:10,584
This isn't about help.

237
00:09:10,618 --> 00:09:11,752
This is about you being
an overprotective mother.

238
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,154
Look, trust me, Detective.

239
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:15,756
I've known Maze for eons.

240
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:17,157
She's got all of this
under control.

241
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,792
So...

242
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:25,833
NORM:
Okeydokey, you betcha.

243
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:26,834
(hangs up phone)

244
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:28,201
Beautiful morning, eh?

245
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,603
Welcome to
the best ski lodge

246
00:09:29,637 --> 00:09:30,904
this side of
the Saskatchewan River.

247
00:09:30,938 --> 00:09:32,973
No offense to the others,
of course.

248
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:34,742
Do you know this guy?

249
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:37,377
Not much of a chitchatter,
are you?

250
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,712
Do you know him?

251
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:42,315
Hmm.

252
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:43,984
"Hmm" you know him or not?

253
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:45,919
(sighs) Gosh, I'm sorry.

254
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:47,320
I-I couldn't tell you
either way.

255
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:49,923
We pride ourselves
on our discretion.

256
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:52,192
And Flapjack Fridays.

257
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:53,927
Uh, would you like
a room, or...?

258
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:57,731
Do you know how to torture
someone... Norm?

259
00:09:57,765 --> 00:09:59,166
Can't say that I do.

260
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:00,934
Well, I do.
I know how to find

261
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:03,971
a human's weakness
and use it against him.

262
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:06,740
For maximum pain.

263
00:10:06,774 --> 00:10:08,008
Oh, I can't see
a nice lady like you

264
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,209
doing something like that.

265
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:11,011
What's your weakness, Norm?

266
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:13,013
Money?
Golly, no.

267
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:14,281
Kink?
That a band?

268
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:15,282
How about I break your fingers?

269
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:17,217
Oh, no.
If you did that,

270
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,052
I wouldn't be able to give
my wife her back rubs.

271
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:20,954
(sighs)

272
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:23,256
Though I suppose I could use
the old elbows in a pinch.

273
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,963
You love your wife,
don't you, Norm?

274
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:31,865
Oh, more than anything.

275
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:34,668
Yeah, I'm one lucky
son of a biscuit.

276
00:10:34,702 --> 00:10:36,236
What-what are you doing?

277
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:38,205
You're a good husband.

278
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:40,207
Um...

279
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,441
A faithful...

280
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,910
Oh.

281
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:45,145
...husband.
Uh...

282
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:48,982
How sweet.

283
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:51,084
I would hate

284
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:53,253
for anything...

285
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:55,756
to get in the way of that.

286
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:58,826
This... th-this is
not nice at all. No.

287
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:01,829
L-Lady, please don't.
Please don't take a photo.

288
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:03,296
(camera clicks)
(Norm grunts)

289
00:11:04,732 --> 00:11:06,299
Oh, no.

290
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,001
Now there's proof.

291
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:10,804
No, there's no proof.
Th-There's nothing happening.

292
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:12,973
Tell your wife that, hmm?

293
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:13,807
I'm sure she'll agree.

294
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:17,144
Hey, lady, can I
get a copy of that?

295
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,412
He-He's in Whistler with some
rich lady named Beauregard.

296
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:21,214
Now-now please get off my lap.

297
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:31,859
You are one terrible...
"B," lady.

298
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:33,293
You're not so bad
yourself, Norm.

299
00:11:40,768 --> 00:11:42,702
(Muffy screaming in pain)

300
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:45,873
(Muffy moans)

301
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:48,041
That's the spot.

302
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:51,444
I am so glad the regular guy
took the day off.

303
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:54,514
You are finding
every single place I hurt.

304
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,883
It's what I do.

305
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,484
Roll over.

306
00:11:59,787 --> 00:12:01,889
So...

307
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:04,024
tell me more about this guy
you're seeing.

308
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,492
Oh.
He sounds charming.

309
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:10,030
He is, but that's not all.

310
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,765
I really shouldn't
tell you this,

311
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:14,034
but he has a secret.

312
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,069
That he's a dangerous
killer on the run?

313
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:18,138
(laughs):
You are so funny.

314
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:19,840
(chuckles)
No.

315
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:21,975
He is a prince.

316
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:24,477
He doesn't want
anyone to know.

317
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:26,246
He's so humble.

318
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,081
Mm.
Finally, I have found a guy

319
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:29,917
who doesn't just want me
for Daddy's money.

320
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,185
Sounds... too
good to be true.

321
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:34,988
I know.

322
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:36,957
Can't wait
to see him tonight.

323
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,026
Tonight?

324
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:40,527
So he's here?

325
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,295
He is.

326
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:44,965
And he's gonna take me
to this castle this weekend.

327
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:45,966
Ooh.

328
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:47,134
(laughs)
How amazing is that?

329
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:49,870
Oh, I can't wait.

330
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:54,407
Um, is it normal
for you to massage my boobs?

331
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:56,243
I can stop if you want.

332
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,445
Didn't say that.

333
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:05,085
Uh, Athena Burns?

334
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,253
I'm Detective Decker.

335
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,989
So you are
Ben Rivers' attorney?

336
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:10,991
I was, but I haven't
heard from him

337
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:12,960
in two years ago,
since he disappeared,

338
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:15,095
so I'm not quite sure
how much help I'll be.

339
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,230
Hmm, that's interesting,
'cause we know

340
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:19,599
that you've been communicating
with him over the phone.

341
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,234
I don't know what
you're talking about.

342
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:22,936
And if you have been
illegally wiretapping me,

343
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,137
this'll be a fun lawsuit.

344
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:25,939
Nope, no wiretapping.

345
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:27,074
We've just been tracking him
through a friend.

346
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:28,508
More stalking,
if you ask me.

347
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:33,180
(clears throat)

348
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:35,515
I noticed that
wherever he's been,

349
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:38,118
there's a corresponding
phone call to your office.

350
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:42,122
Look, I want
to bring him in safely,

351
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,957
and as his attorney,
you should know

352
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:45,158
that that's
in his best interest.

353
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:47,127
This conversation is over.

354
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,461
Oh, good.

355
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,163
Good?

356
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:52,165
Yes. Well, the longer it takes,

357
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:54,034
the angrier
Maze is going to get.

358
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:58,605
Who or what is Maze?

359
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:01,274
Maze is the bounty hunter
that's about to catch Rivers.

360
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:03,510
Yes, and when she finally
catches up with the poor fellow,

361
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:06,279
she is going to tear him
limb from bloody limb.

362
00:14:06,313 --> 00:14:08,615
It'll be fantastic.
She can't do that.

363
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:11,051
Well...
Oh, no, she definitely has the
strength for it, doesn't she?

364
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:12,519
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I mean...

365
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:14,387
Actually, do you have to
bring a bounty back alive?

366
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:16,223
Would just the head suffice?
'Cause that is her thing.

367
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:18,158
Mm.
Maybe we could just

368
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,359
super glue him back
together on delivery.

369
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:20,994
You can't hurt him.

370
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:22,462
(chuckles softly)

371
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:24,464
You seem to care
about him quite a bit.

372
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:28,068
Of course.
He is my client.

373
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:29,436
Mm-hmm.

374
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,106
But...

375
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,407
Mm.
Marvelous.

376
00:14:36,143 --> 00:14:37,510
So, tell me, Ms. Burns,

377
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:40,180
why is his safety
so important to you, eh?

378
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,182
Hmm?

379
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,583
I... I don't...

380
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,652
Oh.

381
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:48,221
You're as formidable as your
power suit suggests, aren't you?

382
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:49,689
But don't worry,
you can tell me.

383
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,091
I know you want to.

384
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:55,095
I love him.

385
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:56,529
Oh.

386
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,966
ATHENA: I helped him
elude the police,

387
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:01,234
and I have been
sending him money ever since.

388
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:02,135
Have you now?

389
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:05,338
(chuckles)

390
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:07,407
He's a cold-blooded murderer.

391
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,110
How could he get you
to do all this?

392
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:12,212
Obviously, you've never met him.

393
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,047
He's not what
you'd expect.

394
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:16,516
He's charming.

395
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:20,253
And handsome and...

396
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:22,522
when he looks you
in the eyes,

397
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:26,226
I don't care who you are.

398
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,295
You are defenseless against him.

399
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:30,197
Oh. I'm sorry.

400
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,999
I thought you were
somebody else.

401
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:34,267
Yeah, that's kind of the point.

402
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:35,535
(handcuffs click)

403
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:37,004
* Yeah

404
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:38,105
* Mm-hmm

405
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:39,106
(chuckles softly)

406
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:41,941
* I like trouble.

407
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:47,347
* Unholy war...

408
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,149
Whiskey, splash of water.

409
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:50,217
BARTENDER:
Right away.

410
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,218
And for the lady?

411
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:52,986
We don't have time for a drink.

412
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,254
Well, there's always
time for a drink.

413
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:59,226
* Go take your freedom...

414
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:00,360
Make mine a double.

415
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:02,195
BARTENDER:
My pleasure.

416
00:16:02,229 --> 00:16:04,297
That's more like it.
I mean, you should celebrate.

417
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:05,765
After all, you did just catch

418
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,134
one of the greatest fugitives
in the world.

419
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,768
Did I?

420
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:12,105
'Cause I kind of expected
a little more killing

421
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:13,240
with my dangerous killer.

422
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:15,342
Well, I'm sorry
to disappoint you.

423
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,409
Oh, don't get me wrong.

424
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:18,611
Tracking you down wasn't easy,

425
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:22,249
but I thought you'd at least
put up a fight, or run.

426
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:24,117
(chuckles)

427
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:25,685
Still holding out hope
you know some kung fu.

428
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:27,520
Hey...

429
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:30,223
I know when I've been beat.

430
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:34,327
You don't seem worried,

431
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:37,230
for a guy who just got caught
after two years on the run.

432
00:16:37,264 --> 00:16:40,367
Oh, well, I knew
it would happen eventually.

433
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,135
Always wondered who'd get me.

434
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:44,137
I got to say,

435
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:46,339
I wasn't expecting someone so...

436
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:48,308
Crazy hot?
Familiar.

437
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,543
We haven't met.
No, I don't mean like that.

438
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:53,313
I mean, I recognize
that look in your eye.

439
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,514
You're a runner.

440
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:56,015
Just like me.

441
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,723
(laughs)

442
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,492
(chuckles)

443
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:08,228
Is that your end game?
Try and get into my head?

444
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:10,497
Trust me, it
ain't gonna work.

445
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,499
What's your name?
Mazikeen Smith.

446
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,434
What's your real name?

447
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:19,339
Fake name. Which means
you're running from something.

448
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,241
Is that so?

449
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:23,643
Best way to pretend you're not
running away from something

450
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:25,345
is to run towards
something else.

451
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:26,479
Take it from
a guy who knows.

452
00:17:26,513 --> 00:17:28,115
Is that what you do?

453
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:29,649
Run into the arms
of wealthy women?

454
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:32,652
It is not
a bad way to live.

455
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:33,853
You didn't hurt Muffy,
did you?

456
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,322
I assume that's
how you found me.

457
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:36,489
Ah, she's fine.

458
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:38,658
She means well,
poor thing.

459
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:40,793
And she's great
in the sack.

460
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:43,663
That she is.

461
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:45,698
(chuckles)

462
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:48,101
Well...

463
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,439
It's been fun.

464
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:54,307
But now it's time
to bring you in.

465
00:17:54,341 --> 00:17:56,409
Or fight.

466
00:17:56,443 --> 00:17:59,179
Please... fight.

467
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,216
You're right.

468
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,417
Time to go.

469
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:06,419
Oh, wait.

470
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:08,388
There's a problem.

471
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:13,260
How are you gonna get
out of those cuffs?

472
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:18,298
* So you better run

473
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:20,133
* Oh

474
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:21,601
(grunts)

475
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:23,136
* Yeah

476
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:25,872
(laughs)
* You better run

477
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:27,140
* Oh.

478
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:31,178
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

479
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:37,384
(phone ringing, vibrating)

480
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:45,258
I don't know who punched a hole
in the bathroom wall.

481
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:47,460
That's not why I'm calling,
but good to know.

482
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:49,796
What, you're checking up on me?

483
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:52,299
Uh, I was just calling to see
if you're okay, that's all.

484
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:54,334
Mm. I'm fine, okay?

485
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:55,902
In fact, I'm great.

486
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:58,405
This Rivers guy is a lot harder
to catch than I thought.

487
00:18:58,438 --> 00:18:59,906
Ah, so you haven't
found him yet?

488
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:01,741
Oh, I found him.
And he got away.

489
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:04,377
And that's a good thing?
What if he comes after you now?

490
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:05,745
You think he would?

491
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:07,747
Maze... (sighs)

492
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,816
Rivers is dangerous in ways

493
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:11,818
that I don't think
you're prepared for.

494
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:13,520
He's emotionally dangerous.

495
00:19:13,553 --> 00:19:14,821
I don't even know
what that means.

496
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:16,289
I know, and that's the problem.

497
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:18,358
If...

498
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,229
CHLOE:
What the hell are you doing?

499
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:24,364
Reminding you that you
are not Maze's mother.

500
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:26,666
She's got her big-girl
pants on. She's fine.

501
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:29,302
Really? Because she caught
Rivers, and he got away.

502
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:31,371
(laughs):
Oh, I doubt that.

503
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:32,772
Don't touch my nose.
It's true.

504
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:34,774
Lucifer, if he already
got in her head...

505
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:37,377
He hasn't. He probably just
came at her with a flamethrower

506
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,212
or something, which'll just
piss Maze off even more.

507
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:40,513
Now, did you tell her

508
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:42,482
we found out where
Rivers has been staying?

509
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,451
I didn't.
I don't know if I'm going to.

510
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:45,952
I'm worried about her.

511
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:47,587
Clearly, you're not.

512
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,256
No, I'm not.

513
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:50,723
I just sent her
the address.

514
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:52,425
Lucifer...
A flamethrower,
Detective.

515
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:54,261
Or maybe even an Uzi.

516
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:56,263
Either way, it's nothing
Maze can't handle.

517
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:58,231
I'm sure.

518
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,442
(dramatic classical music
playing over speakers)

519
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:26,859
Nice place.

520
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:30,397
Wish you had
some rock and roll, though.

521
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,399
Well, I'll
tell you what.

522
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:34,534
I'll run down to the store,
pick up a couple records,

523
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:35,802
be right back.
Stay.

524
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:37,604
There's always time
for a drink.

525
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:38,638
(chuckles)

526
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,508
Wha...?

527
00:20:44,811 --> 00:20:46,446
(grunts)

528
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:48,648
Come on.
Didn't we do this already?

529
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:50,917
It's not going to be
so easy this time.

530
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:54,654
That's a new one.

531
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:56,889
Look, I really don't
want to fight you.

532
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:58,791
Mm, I really do.

533
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:01,494
Okay.

534
00:21:01,528 --> 00:21:03,563
Play time's over.

535
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:04,964
I don't think so.

536
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:13,306
I get it now. The
handcuffs, the music.

537
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,974
You wanted to
dance with me.

538
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:17,544
Or I wanted to cover
the sounds of screaming.

539
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:22,849
I know a little kung fu.

540
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:31,391
I'm beginning to think you
wanted me to escape that bar.

541
00:21:31,424 --> 00:21:32,759
You like chasing me, don't you?

542
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,761
I like a challenge.

543
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,529
Shame it's not you.

544
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:42,402
(grunts)
I don't want to shoot you.

545
00:21:43,703 --> 00:21:45,004
Yeah, well, you had no problem

546
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:47,006
killing those two people
in cold blood.

547
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,843
(sighs) Look, I've done a lot
of terrible things in my life.

548
00:21:50,877 --> 00:21:52,545
That's not one of them.

549
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:53,580
I was framed.

550
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:56,115
(groans, grunts)

551
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,717
I don't care.

552
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,386
Yeah, well, you should.

553
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:01,053
'Cause Herrera's
gonna betray you next.

554
00:22:01,087 --> 00:22:03,656
CHLOE:
Lieutenant Herrera?

555
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,492
And you must be
Detective Decker.
Uh, yes.

556
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:07,126
Pleasure.
Pleasure.

557
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,396
I know what this is about,
and I-I didn't mean

558
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:11,564
to stick my nose
in another cop's case.

559
00:22:11,598 --> 00:22:12,865
Wait, wait.
You think I'm mad?

560
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:14,133
(laughs)
Are you kidding me?

561
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,702
You got me a new lead.

562
00:22:15,735 --> 00:22:17,370
I'm here to thank you.

563
00:22:17,404 --> 00:22:18,371
Oh.

564
00:22:18,405 --> 00:22:19,672
Uh, you know,

565
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:20,707
but now that you
cracked it open...

566
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,575
Mm-hmm?
...if you don't mind,

567
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:24,744
I want to carry this one
across the finish line.

568
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:25,645
Are you sure?
I'm happy to help.

569
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:26,879
Don't worry,

570
00:22:26,913 --> 00:22:28,681
I'll give you all the credit.

571
00:22:28,715 --> 00:22:30,617
It's just that
this one means a lot to me.

572
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:32,985
The one that got away, you know?

573
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:34,454
Right.

574
00:22:34,487 --> 00:22:36,022
Yeah, of course. Absolutely.

575
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,458
Oh.

576
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:39,692
Yeah.

577
00:22:39,726 --> 00:22:40,760
Yeah.

578
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:41,894
Thanks, Detective.

579
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:47,400
Yeah, I used to work
for Herrera, just like you.

580
00:22:47,434 --> 00:22:49,168
He sent me to track
people down, or worse.

581
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:52,071
Then, one day, I quit.
He didn't like that.

582
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:54,541
That's a really nice story,
but like I said...

583
00:22:54,574 --> 00:22:56,108
You don't care.
I don't.

584
00:22:56,142 --> 00:22:58,745
(knock on door)
JOAN: Room service.

585
00:22:58,778 --> 00:23:00,547
Never run on an empty stomach.
(door opens)

586
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:03,616
Say one word
and I'll break your arm.

587
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,485
Ah! Okay, all right.

588
00:23:05,518 --> 00:23:07,554
Whatever you say.
We're just a happy couple.

589
00:23:07,587 --> 00:23:09,489
Mr. and Mrs.
Mazikeen Smith.

590
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:14,494
I've seen you before.

591
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,445
Hi.

592
00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:35,615
All right.

593
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:38,184
Come on, Maze, pick up.
Pick up.

594
00:23:38,217 --> 00:23:39,519
(automatic gunfire,
phone ringing)

595
00:23:43,723 --> 00:23:45,925
Huh, not a good time, Decker.

596
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:46,926
(gunfire continues)

597
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:48,828
Hey, it's me again.

598
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:50,630
I-I know you think
I'm just being a worrier,

599
00:23:50,663 --> 00:23:52,699
but there is something strange
going on with this case,

600
00:23:52,732 --> 00:23:54,667
so call me back ASAP.

601
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:03,810
(sighs)

602
00:24:03,843 --> 00:24:05,111
Hey.

603
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:07,179
Look, I have a favor to ask you.

604
00:24:07,213 --> 00:24:09,516
(gun clicks empty)

605
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:10,617
Hello?

606
00:24:11,718 --> 00:24:13,586
(singsongy):
Hello?

607
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,187
Everyone in here dead?

608
00:24:16,923 --> 00:24:19,492
No? Didn't think so.

609
00:24:19,526 --> 00:24:20,693
(gun clicks)

610
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:27,734
All right, we got to get
the hell out of here.

611
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:29,902
We can't just wait
for her to mow us down.

612
00:24:29,936 --> 00:24:31,704
Oh, I'm not waiting.

613
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:35,207
Seriously? Knives
to a gunfight?

614
00:24:38,878 --> 00:24:40,813
What the hell was that suppo...
(Joan grunts, gunfire stops)

615
00:24:40,847 --> 00:24:41,848
JOAN:
Ow.

616
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,518
And you're welcome.

617
00:24:45,552 --> 00:24:47,787
(groaning)

618
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,088
See?

619
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:51,924
I don't need a gun
to save your ass.

620
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:52,992
Come on.
(groans)

621
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:55,628
Well, define
"saved," exactly.

622
00:24:59,866 --> 00:25:00,767
(groans)

623
00:25:02,902 --> 00:25:04,904
LUCIFER: I've never seen
the detective quite like it.

624
00:25:04,937 --> 00:25:07,707
She's afraid that
Maze will get bamboozled

625
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,909
into helping
this handsome con man.

626
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:11,010
It's preposterous.

627
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:12,779
And you're
not concerned?

628
00:25:12,812 --> 00:25:14,714
Oh, please.

629
00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:16,883
Maze and I have been
through the plagues, the floods,

630
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:18,551
the Dave Matthews Band.

631
00:25:18,585 --> 00:25:21,654
She can handle
a measly bounty, I'm sure.

632
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:23,790
What if it's not a
bounty she's after?

633
00:25:23,823 --> 00:25:25,792
What if she's trying
to prove something?

634
00:25:25,825 --> 00:25:27,594
What, that she can
scare an entire country?

635
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:32,098
Or that her life has meaning.

636
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:33,800
With or without a soul.

637
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:35,201
(laughs)
Every one of us

638
00:25:35,234 --> 00:25:37,804
wants to connect
to something, Lucifer.

639
00:25:37,837 --> 00:25:39,906
Or someone.
Oh, come on.

640
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:41,107
She's a demon.
(computer ringing)

641
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,943
Oh. Apologies. One sec.

642
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:51,217
Uh, I-I can't
talk right now, Maze.

643
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,319
I'm with a patient.

644
00:25:53,352 --> 00:25:55,988
Yeah, well, so am I.

645
00:25:56,022 --> 00:25:57,657
(Rivers grunts)

646
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,058
Is that a gunshot wound?

647
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:00,927
Oh, Mazikeen,
you little rascal.

648
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,762
Did you shoot the fellow?
Well done.

649
00:26:02,795 --> 00:26:03,896
No, I didn't shoot him.

650
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:06,065
Some psycho from
room service did.

651
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:08,601
Well, so much for
Canadian hospitality.

652
00:26:08,635 --> 00:26:10,603
Look, I don't have time
to explain, okay?

653
00:26:10,637 --> 00:26:12,138
How do I stop this human
from dying?

654
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:15,241
LINDA: Take him to a hospital,
that's how.

655
00:26:15,274 --> 00:26:16,909
I mean, how many times
do I have to tell you

656
00:26:16,943 --> 00:26:18,611
I'm not that
kind of doctor?

657
00:26:18,645 --> 00:26:20,980
(Rivers screams, groans)

658
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:21,981
LINDA:
Whoa. Okay, okay, okay, okay.

659
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:23,716
First things first,

660
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,351
did the bullet go
all the way through?

661
00:26:27,053 --> 00:26:28,087
I don't know.

662
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,088
(screams)

663
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:30,923
Ow! What are you doing?!

664
00:26:30,957 --> 00:26:32,792
Get... Stop it!

665
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:33,993
(gasps)
Get-- Will you s...

666
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:35,294
Oh, no, it's
still in there.

667
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:36,963
Good.
Okay, all right.

668
00:26:36,996 --> 00:26:38,264
Well, in order to
stop the bleeding,

669
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:40,633
you're going to have
to remove the bullet

670
00:26:40,667 --> 00:26:42,702
and stitch up
the wound.
Oh.

671
00:26:42,735 --> 00:26:44,170
Oh, yeah, you know what,
I'm good.

672
00:26:44,203 --> 00:26:46,105
Relax, okay?

673
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:47,339
I'm great at
dismembering humans.

674
00:26:47,373 --> 00:26:48,941
How hard can it be
to fix one?

675
00:26:48,975 --> 00:26:50,977
Maybe you should
listen to him, Maze.

676
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,912
I mean, it's everyone's right
to refuse treatment.

677
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:55,214
He is my bounty and I am
taking him in one piece.

678
00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:56,716
(groans)
Just tell me
what to do, Doc.

679
00:26:56,749 --> 00:26:57,917
Uh, okay.

680
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,319
Uh, find the hotel sewing kit.

681
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:02,755
You can stitch him up
with that, and you'll need

682
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:03,890
alcohol for the wound.

683
00:27:06,726 --> 00:27:07,894
(grunts)

684
00:27:07,927 --> 00:27:10,229
(panting)

685
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:12,965
What?

686
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:13,933
Well, you're not
that handsome.

687
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,702
That's helpful. Thank you.

688
00:27:15,735 --> 00:27:16,302
You're welcome.

689
00:27:17,436 --> 00:27:18,905
Got everything.

690
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:20,039
What...

691
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:21,173
Next.

692
00:27:21,207 --> 00:27:23,242
Well, you'll have to...

693
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:25,177
fish out the bullet.
(chuckles)

694
00:27:25,211 --> 00:27:27,780
Oh, you know what, I've grown
kind of attached to it.

695
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:29,381
I think I'm gonna keep it.
Thank you, though.

696
00:27:29,415 --> 00:27:30,883
(grunts)

697
00:27:30,917 --> 00:27:32,051
And if you have
any sedatives,

698
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:33,185
I highly recommend
he takes them.

699
00:27:33,219 --> 00:27:34,420
You got any drugs?

700
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:35,922
What?
Too bad.

701
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:39,959
Sorry.

702
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:56,242
You know, I-I got this.
I'll let you know if he dies.

703
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,949
Is it me, or did
the most skilled torturer

704
00:28:02,982 --> 00:28:05,417
Hell's ever known
just fluff that man's pillow?

705
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:08,921
It's not you.

706
00:28:08,955 --> 00:28:11,157
Right.

707
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,459
Then it's true.

708
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:15,828
He broke my Maze.

709
00:28:22,168 --> 00:28:24,070
(grunts softly)

710
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,475
Well, this is different.

711
00:28:31,077 --> 00:28:33,312
That's Miss Alien.

712
00:28:33,345 --> 00:28:36,949
Nothing weird happened,
if that's what you're wondering.

713
00:28:36,983 --> 00:28:38,117
I-I wasn't.

714
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,852
But thank you.

715
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:40,787
(groans):
Oh.

716
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,254
Oh, my head hurts.

717
00:28:42,288 --> 00:28:44,023
Yeah, pre-surgical knockout.

718
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:45,324
Least I got
the bullet out, though.

719
00:28:45,357 --> 00:28:47,794
Oh.

720
00:28:47,827 --> 00:28:50,129
Is that a button?

721
00:28:50,162 --> 00:28:51,130
Sure.

722
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:53,265
Come on. Get ready.

723
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:54,967
We're leaving in five.

724
00:28:55,001 --> 00:28:56,535
You take me back,
I'm a dead man.

725
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,137
Not my problem.

726
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,972
You still think I'm guilty.

727
00:29:00,006 --> 00:29:01,440
Even after
they tried to kill me.

728
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:03,910
Fugitives get shot at.
Occupational hazard.

729
00:29:03,943 --> 00:29:07,279
I'm telling you, Herrera
paid the security guard to lie.

730
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:09,148
It doesn't matter.

731
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:10,983
Yeah, it does.

732
00:29:11,017 --> 00:29:13,285
I didn't kill those kids.

733
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:15,187
They were teenagers.
That's why I refused.

734
00:29:15,221 --> 00:29:18,224
Why? No challenge?

735
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:20,159
No.

736
00:29:20,192 --> 00:29:22,194
'Cause when you kill,
you lose a piece of your soul.

737
00:29:22,228 --> 00:29:24,263
I'm trying to hold on
to what I got left of mine.

738
00:29:26,866 --> 00:29:28,100
I get the feeling
you understand that.

739
00:29:28,134 --> 00:29:30,136
Sorry. No soul here.

740
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:32,538
Really?

741
00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:34,240
That's not what I see.

742
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:36,408
(knock on door)

743
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:38,410
Let me guess.

744
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:39,812
More room service?

745
00:29:42,348 --> 00:29:44,216
Whoa! Whoa!

746
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,218
Seriously!

747
00:29:46,252 --> 00:29:48,187
You don't look before you throw?

748
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,488
What are you doing here, Dan?

749
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:52,024
I don't know, Maze, you tell me.

750
00:29:52,058 --> 00:29:53,926
I should be drinking
a mai tai right now,

751
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,594
but instead, I'm getting worried
phone calls from Chloe

752
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,229
asking me to check up on you.

753
00:29:57,263 --> 00:29:59,098
And you did it?

754
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:02,201
I was on a layover
in Vancouver, okay?

755
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:03,870
It was a miles flight.

756
00:30:03,903 --> 00:30:05,337
I just...

757
00:30:05,371 --> 00:30:07,106
I shouldn't have come here.

758
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:08,474
What is Decker
so worried out about anyway?

759
00:30:11,911 --> 00:30:13,145
Something about
this Rivers case.

760
00:30:15,114 --> 00:30:16,448
She thinks that something weird
might be going on with...

761
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:18,284
With the lieutenant?
Yeah.

762
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:20,286
Uh-huh. How'd you know?

763
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:23,122
'Cause my bounty
just said the same thing.

764
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:25,091
River...

765
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:35,501
DAN:
Okay.

766
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:38,204
Thanks.

767
00:30:38,237 --> 00:30:40,272
I filled Chloe in
on Rivers' story.

768
00:30:40,306 --> 00:30:43,109
Lying security guard?

769
00:30:43,142 --> 00:30:44,510
I don't know, Maze.

770
00:30:44,543 --> 00:30:45,978
Sounds like a long shot.

771
00:30:46,012 --> 00:30:47,213
You think I got played.

772
00:30:49,115 --> 00:30:50,883
I think...

773
00:30:50,917 --> 00:30:52,184
Rivers is a con man.

774
00:30:52,218 --> 00:30:54,120
(sighs)
I'm not an idiot, Dan.

775
00:30:54,153 --> 00:30:55,888
I know.
You said it yourself:

776
00:30:55,922 --> 00:30:58,190
there's something weird going on
with this Herrera guy.

777
00:30:58,224 --> 00:31:02,228
If Rivers is so innocent,
why the hell did he run?

778
00:31:02,261 --> 00:31:05,064
'Cause who would
believe him?

779
00:31:05,097 --> 00:31:07,199
Even I didn't.

780
00:31:07,233 --> 00:31:10,202
Either way, psycho room service
chick is out there.

781
00:31:10,236 --> 00:31:12,371
We need to get to him
before she does.

782
00:31:12,404 --> 00:31:13,605
How?

783
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:15,374
What, with my knives
and your gun?

784
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:16,375
Piece a cake.

785
00:31:16,408 --> 00:31:18,077
(grunts)

786
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,378
One small problem.

787
00:31:19,411 --> 00:31:21,247
I don't actually
have my gun.

788
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,649
You're a cop
and you don't have your gun?

789
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:25,151
I'm supposed to
be on vacation.

790
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,285
A boring one, apparently.

791
00:31:26,318 --> 00:31:27,386
You want to
help this guy?

792
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,088
The best thing to do

793
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:30,622
is to turn this case
over to the Canadians.

794
00:31:30,656 --> 00:31:32,258
Let the Mounties
handle it.

795
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:34,560
Why? So they can
nice the bad guys to death?

796
00:31:34,593 --> 00:31:37,129
We don't have
any jurisdiction here, Maze.

797
00:31:37,163 --> 00:31:39,198
This whole thing can get
real messy real fast.

798
00:31:40,967 --> 00:31:43,635
Fine. Have it your way.

799
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:44,636
Really?

800
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,505
Yeah.

801
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:49,241
Well, I'm just, uh, I'm
surprised you actually agreed.

802
00:31:49,275 --> 00:31:51,110
It...

803
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:52,578
shows growth.

804
00:31:52,611 --> 00:31:54,580
It's healthy.

805
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:56,949
Nice.

806
00:31:56,983 --> 00:31:59,485
Uh, yeah, this is
Detective Espinoza

807
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:01,253
from the Los Angeles
Police Department.

808
00:32:01,287 --> 00:32:03,255
I need to report a fugitive.

809
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:05,524
Yeah. Uh, yeah, one second.

810
00:32:05,557 --> 00:32:06,993
Hey, what was Rivers...

811
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,362
...wearing?

812
00:32:10,396 --> 00:32:12,598
All right.

813
00:32:12,631 --> 00:32:14,200
LUCIFER:
Ah! There you are.

814
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:16,068
Okay, you were right.

815
00:32:16,102 --> 00:32:19,071
It seems this Rivers fellow
may have indeed hoodwinked Maze.

816
00:32:19,105 --> 00:32:22,074
Or maybe I was wrong.

817
00:32:22,108 --> 00:32:25,144
Okay, who are you and what have
you done with the detective?

818
00:32:25,177 --> 00:32:27,213
Turns out Maze
spoke to Rivers.

819
00:32:27,246 --> 00:32:29,381
He claims the security
guard was lying,

820
00:32:29,415 --> 00:32:31,450
that he was forced to
pin the murder on him.

821
00:32:31,483 --> 00:32:33,185
That's why Rivers is on the run.

822
00:32:33,219 --> 00:32:35,154
And you believe
that preposterous story?

823
00:32:35,187 --> 00:32:36,989
An innocent man
wrongly accused?

824
00:32:37,023 --> 00:32:38,424
I mean, where did
he escape from, Shawshank?

825
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:40,059
Did he crawl through
a mile of sh...
Hey!

826
00:32:40,092 --> 00:32:42,161
It's not like Maze
to reach out with a lead.

827
00:32:42,194 --> 00:32:43,495
I know. This is much worse
than I thought.

828
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:45,664
I mean, first she fluffs
the man's pillow,

829
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:47,566
and now she's trying
to clear his name.

830
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:49,468
Do you know, I never thought
I'd say this, Detective,

831
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:51,003
but we need to go to Canada.

832
00:32:51,037 --> 00:32:53,072
Now.
Wait. Hold on!
Hold on.

833
00:32:53,105 --> 00:32:54,573
I can tell
you're worried--

834
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:55,707
and that's actually
really endearing--

835
00:32:55,741 --> 00:32:57,343
but Dan's there.

836
00:32:57,376 --> 00:32:59,011
That's worse.
Right now,

837
00:32:59,045 --> 00:33:00,446
Maze needs
a different kind of help.

838
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:02,014
What, some strong drugs
and a lobotomy?

839
00:33:02,048 --> 00:33:04,250
She needs us to trust her.

840
00:33:04,283 --> 00:33:06,285
(laughs)

841
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:08,087
You're actually serious,
aren't you?

842
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,222
You're the one who said
Maze can handle herself,

843
00:33:10,256 --> 00:33:11,357
and I think you're right.

844
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:13,359
She trusts us enough
to ask for help.

845
00:33:13,392 --> 00:33:15,061
We owe it to her
to follow her lead.

846
00:33:15,094 --> 00:33:16,595
Oh, boy.

847
00:33:16,628 --> 00:33:18,664
Unless this is about you
being the overprotective mother.

848
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:20,532
Oh. Low blow, Detective.

849
00:33:20,566 --> 00:33:22,234
Well...

850
00:33:22,268 --> 00:33:23,435
Fine. Let's speak
to the security guard,

851
00:33:23,469 --> 00:33:25,404
if only to prove
that this Rivers

852
00:33:25,437 --> 00:33:27,773
is indeed a con man so I can
freely punch him in his smug,

853
00:33:27,806 --> 00:33:29,741
mildly handsome face.

854
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,779
*

855
00:33:45,724 --> 00:33:48,260
(door opens)

856
00:33:48,294 --> 00:33:50,062
Thanks for coming in, Pete.

857
00:33:50,096 --> 00:33:51,730
We just have some questions
about the Rivers case

858
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:54,233
and to clarify some things
about your testimony.

859
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:57,369
I.e., tell us
what we all already know.

860
00:33:57,403 --> 00:33:58,804
(whispers):
Guilty.

861
00:34:00,106 --> 00:34:01,473
Anything I can do.

862
00:34:01,507 --> 00:34:03,509
Thanks. Is it true

863
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:06,145
that you saw Rivers shoot those
two kids at point-blank range?

864
00:34:06,178 --> 00:34:08,347
Sadly, yes.
LUCIFER: See?

865
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,415
What did I tell you? Guilty.

866
00:34:09,448 --> 00:34:10,849
Now can I go to Canada?

867
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:11,850
Not yet.

868
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,585
Uh...

869
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:15,521
How many times
did you see him fire, exactly?

870
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:18,524
Oh. Uh, it was a few years ago.

871
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:19,458
Hard to remember now.

872
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:21,393
LUCIFER:
Oh, come now, Peter.

873
00:34:21,427 --> 00:34:23,395
Think about it. I mean,
a rotten apple like Rivers

874
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:24,763
would shoot every bullet he had,
wouldn't he?

875
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:26,598
Lucifer.
How many's in a clip? 12?

876
00:34:26,632 --> 00:34:28,434
15? 20?
Please...

877
00:34:28,467 --> 00:34:30,502
Yeah. That sounds about right.

878
00:34:30,536 --> 00:34:32,138
LUCIFER:
He's a vile predator,

879
00:34:32,171 --> 00:34:33,805
that one, isn't he?
The worst.

880
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,774
Bet he shot those poor kids
right in the back, didn't he?

881
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:37,309
(sighs)

882
00:34:37,343 --> 00:34:39,245
He totally did.

883
00:34:39,278 --> 00:34:40,446
Really?

884
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:42,214
'Cause in your testimony,

885
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:43,849
you said it was
the other way around.

886
00:34:43,882 --> 00:34:45,851
Oh. Uh...

887
00:34:45,884 --> 00:34:47,686
You know, I...

888
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:50,456
By... I assume by "back,"
you meant, like...

889
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:51,690
the opposite.

890
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:52,891
Oh, so you're just telling us

891
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,527
what you think
we want to hear, huh?

892
00:34:55,561 --> 00:34:57,263
I thought
that's what you wanted.

893
00:34:58,697 --> 00:35:00,599
Aren't you working with...
Herrera?

894
00:35:02,668 --> 00:35:04,236
Not exactly.

895
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:06,238
LUCIFER:
Wait.

896
00:35:06,272 --> 00:35:08,240
What just happened?

897
00:35:08,274 --> 00:35:10,576
Maze is right.
Rivers is innocent.

898
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:13,379
Which means she's in
more trouble than she knows.

899
00:35:19,485 --> 00:35:21,420
*

900
00:35:36,335 --> 00:35:38,504
MAZE:
Hey! Room Service!

901
00:35:38,537 --> 00:35:39,571
That's my bounty, bitch.

902
00:35:44,276 --> 00:35:46,812
Well, well, if it isn't
our clever little friend

903
00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:48,547
with the knives.

904
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,616
So nice of you to join us.
Back off.

905
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:52,684
He's mine.

906
00:35:52,718 --> 00:35:54,520
Okay, first off,

907
00:35:54,553 --> 00:35:56,922
ladies, I don't
belong to anyone.

908
00:35:56,955 --> 00:35:58,524
And, secondly,

909
00:35:58,557 --> 00:36:00,559
I got these guys
exactly where I want them.

910
00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:02,794
This gun to my head?

911
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:04,496
I like it there.

912
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:07,433
And these big
scowly dudes,

913
00:36:07,466 --> 00:36:08,734
harmless.

914
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:11,603
So you should go
before you get in the way.

915
00:36:12,738 --> 00:36:13,839
(groans)

916
00:36:13,872 --> 00:36:16,575
What part of "you're my bounty"

917
00:36:16,608 --> 00:36:18,410
do you not get?

918
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,981
I'm not going anywhere.

919
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,616
JOAN:
Actually,

920
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:26,385
that part's true.

921
00:36:26,418 --> 00:36:29,588
See, you saved us a trip.

922
00:36:29,621 --> 00:36:32,924
After all, we weren't about
to let you live after you threw

923
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:34,693
a damn knife at me.

924
00:36:34,726 --> 00:36:36,295
Oh, well,
thanks for bringing backup.

925
00:36:36,328 --> 00:36:37,663
More fun for me.
(chuckles)

926
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:39,965
Oh, and he's cute, too.

927
00:36:40,966 --> 00:36:41,933
Bonus.

928
00:36:41,967 --> 00:36:43,535
Kill her first.

929
00:36:50,409 --> 00:36:51,510
(grunting)

930
00:36:54,646 --> 00:36:55,981
(shouting, grunting)

931
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,651
(panting)

932
00:36:59,685 --> 00:37:01,653
Oh, crap.

933
00:37:01,687 --> 00:37:03,589
(yells)

934
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:07,893
(silenced gunshots)

935
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:10,862
(man screams)

936
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:17,603
(choking)

937
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,045
Well, well, well.

938
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,847
Look who saved who.

939
00:37:31,717 --> 00:37:32,951
I told you I had 'em.

940
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,789
(chuckles, groans)

941
00:37:37,823 --> 00:37:39,725
(groans, hisses)

942
00:37:43,028 --> 00:37:44,996
(groans, chuckles)

943
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,333
You opened your stitch,
didn't you?

944
00:37:47,366 --> 00:37:49,801
I hope I didn't lose the button.
(coughs, chuckles)

945
00:37:49,835 --> 00:37:51,770
(sirens wailing,
helicopter whirring in distance)

946
00:38:00,746 --> 00:38:02,848
I'll handle this.

947
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:03,982
Go.

948
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:05,951
Come on.

949
00:38:11,657 --> 00:38:12,891
(chuckles)

950
00:38:12,924 --> 00:38:15,060
Okay, seriously,
this is getting old.

951
00:38:15,093 --> 00:38:16,995
Why are you in my office now?

952
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:19,798
Uh, correction,
it was your office.

953
00:38:19,831 --> 00:38:22,067
Turns out murderers
aren't allowed to masquerade

954
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,835
as lieutenants anymore.

955
00:38:23,869 --> 00:38:25,070
What are you
talking about?

956
00:38:25,103 --> 00:38:27,673
He's talking about how you had

957
00:38:27,706 --> 00:38:29,608
those kids killed,
how you framed Rivers,

958
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:30,842
and you almost killed our friend

959
00:38:30,876 --> 00:38:32,878
who was trying
to clean up your mess.

960
00:38:32,911 --> 00:38:34,846
(chuckles) Okay, wait a
minute, all right? Wait.

961
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,715
This is absurd.

962
00:38:36,748 --> 00:38:38,784
You can't possibly believe
a-a con man's story.

963
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,452
We don't have to.

964
00:38:40,486 --> 00:38:42,754
We have testimony from the guard
you forced to lie.

965
00:38:42,788 --> 00:38:44,790
Uh, and the hit man
you hired

966
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:46,458
is currently
in Canadian custody.

967
00:38:46,492 --> 00:38:48,860
But don't worry,
they gave you all the credit.

968
00:38:48,894 --> 00:38:50,629
You're under arrest.

969
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:51,897
Oh, come on. Really?

970
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:52,864
Yes. Really.

971
00:38:52,898 --> 00:38:54,700
And if it's
any consolation,

972
00:38:54,733 --> 00:38:56,668
I suggested we beat you to death
with our bare hands,

973
00:38:56,702 --> 00:38:58,904
but the detective insisted
we do it by the book.

974
00:38:58,937 --> 00:39:01,873
And considering I know where
you're eventually going to go,

975
00:39:01,907 --> 00:39:03,509
that's fine by me.

976
00:39:08,914 --> 00:39:10,849
(sighs)

977
00:39:17,423 --> 00:39:19,391
Thanks, Decker.

978
00:39:19,425 --> 00:39:20,358
(phone beeps)

979
00:39:23,762 --> 00:39:27,799
Well, looks like all
your whining finally paid off.

980
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:31,437
Herrera just got arrested for
the murder of those two kids.

981
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:32,804
(exhales)
So...

982
00:39:32,838 --> 00:39:35,040
So...

983
00:39:35,073 --> 00:39:36,975
so I'm not a fugitive anymore.

984
00:39:37,008 --> 00:39:38,977
Yeah, which kind of screws me,

985
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,512
'cause you're also
not my bounty anymore either.

986
00:39:40,546 --> 00:39:42,147
Mm.

987
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,849
No good deed.

988
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:45,984
(both chuckle)

989
00:39:46,017 --> 00:39:47,619
(sighs)

990
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:51,389
Did you hear
what I just said?

991
00:39:52,991 --> 00:39:54,860
You don't have to run anymore.

992
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:57,796
You can... come home.

993
00:39:57,829 --> 00:40:01,533
Yeah, you don't get it.

994
00:40:01,567 --> 00:40:03,535
This doesn't end with Herrera.

995
00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:05,771
He's just a cog
in the machine.

996
00:40:05,804 --> 00:40:09,975
The people he works for,
they'll never stop chasing me.

997
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:11,943
Okay.

998
00:40:11,977 --> 00:40:13,879
Dramatic much?

999
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:16,848
If you worked for Herrera,
they know about you, too.

1000
00:40:16,882 --> 00:40:18,116
Everything about you.

1001
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:19,851
I sincerely doubt that.

1002
00:40:19,885 --> 00:40:23,889
Yeah, well,
you don't know them like I do.

1003
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:24,956
(groans softly)

1004
00:40:27,025 --> 00:40:28,827
I can never stop running, Maze.

1005
00:40:30,596 --> 00:40:33,732
But what if...

1006
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:35,867
what if you came with me?

1007
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:39,971
We can do this, Maze.

1008
00:40:40,005 --> 00:40:41,873
You and me,
we're the same.

1009
00:40:41,907 --> 00:40:44,175
No roots. No family.

1010
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:48,580
We can...
hit a new city every week,

1011
00:40:48,614 --> 00:40:51,216
see the most beautiful places,

1012
00:40:51,249 --> 00:40:54,686
live every day
like it's our last.

1013
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,122
And all you got to do is...

1014
00:40:57,155 --> 00:40:58,924
join me.

1015
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:01,927
* Burned leaves
beneath the trees *

1016
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,764
* It's getting dark,
my body spins *

1017
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:08,867
* The breeze
that pushes me downhill *

1018
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,869
* The salty air...

1019
00:41:10,902 --> 00:41:12,070
Welcome back, Maze.

1020
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:13,639
(chuckles)

1021
00:41:13,672 --> 00:41:15,073
CHLOE:
Welcome home, lady.

1022
00:41:15,106 --> 00:41:17,609
Missed you, Maze.

1023
00:41:17,643 --> 00:41:19,845
LUCIFER:
Didn't doubt you for a minute.

1024
00:41:19,878 --> 00:41:21,813
(chuckles)

1025
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:25,050
Forgetting something?

1026
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:26,051
Oh.

1027
00:41:28,687 --> 00:41:31,289
I, uh, can get you a new one.

1028
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,124
She kind of got a little...

1029
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:35,761
dirty.

1030
00:41:35,794 --> 00:41:37,996
Is that... blood?

1031
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:38,964
Oh, yeah.

1032
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,131
Awesome!

1033
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:42,000
(chuckles)

1034
00:41:42,033 --> 00:41:43,769
No, why don't we put
Miss Alien in the wash.

1035
00:41:46,071 --> 00:41:48,106
TRIXIE: You won't
change her, right?

1036
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:50,308
* A warning coming
from another age... *

1037
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:51,843
Maze.

1038
00:41:51,877 --> 00:41:53,679
Hmm?

1039
00:41:53,712 --> 00:41:54,646
You all right?

1040
00:41:56,782 --> 00:41:59,150
I'm exactly where I want to be.

1041
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:02,788
* Vivid colors
from a fading sun *

1042
00:42:02,821 --> 00:42:04,255
* Brings me now

1043
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:09,260
* To another wold

1044
00:42:09,294 --> 00:42:12,330
* Come on, come on, come on...

1045
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,032
You're not coming, are you?

1046
00:42:14,065 --> 00:42:17,636
You may not have roots, but...

1047
00:42:17,669 --> 00:42:19,871
turns out I do.

1048
00:42:19,905 --> 00:42:22,040
And I may even...

1049
00:42:23,909 --> 00:42:25,611
...miss them.

1050
00:42:25,644 --> 00:42:27,779
And here you thought
you didn't have a soul.

1051
00:42:27,813 --> 00:42:29,648
(chuckles)

1052
00:42:29,681 --> 00:42:31,817
Remember what I said, Maze.

1053
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:33,118
Be careful.

1054
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,955
They know more than you think.

1055
00:42:49,768 --> 00:42:51,670
*

1056
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:12,791
*
