1
00:00:02,303 --> 00:00:03,271
Previously on Lucifer...
CHLOE: I figured out that you're

2
00:00:03,304 --> 00:00:04,138
the one who grabbed
the Sinnerman.

3
00:00:04,172 --> 00:00:06,340
I told you, I did this for us.
For us.

4
00:00:06,374 --> 00:00:08,642
I had your back on this,
and for whatever reason,

5
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:10,644
you still felt the need
to go behind mine.

6
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:13,747
I just read the crime scene
report, and holy burrito bowl!

7
00:00:13,781 --> 00:00:15,316
Lopez, just stop talking!

8
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,685
MAZE:
It was weird

9
00:00:17,718 --> 00:00:20,321
seeing you and Amenadiel
so chummy.

10
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:21,822
I don't want you two
getting together.

11
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,557
LINDA:
I understand.

12
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:25,526
I can see why Lucifer's
so affected by you.

13
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:27,728
It's because you're
special, Decker.

14
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:29,097
LUCIFER:
What if the Sinnerman

15
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,664
was the one working
for someone else?

16
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:33,567
The world's first murderer,
marked by God

17
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:37,605
and doomed to walk the Earth
alone for a tortured eternity.

18
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:40,608
It's quite the moniker.
Wouldn't you agree, Kane?

19
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,616
(Pierce sighs)

20
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:54,355
Thanks for the drink.

21
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,190
Figured it's the least
I could do.

22
00:00:56,224 --> 00:00:57,525
After all, I am the reason

23
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,660
you're leaking
all over my floor.

24
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:01,529
(scoffs)

25
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:05,733
Well, gosh, we have so much
to catch up on, don't we, Kane?

26
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:07,635
Or would you
prefer Mr. Kane?

27
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:09,303
Make it sound official?

28
00:01:09,337 --> 00:01:10,671
Let's just stick with Pierce.

29
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:11,705
Very well.

30
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:13,874
Why all the games, Pierce?

31
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,509
No games.
Oh, really?

32
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:17,711
Now you'll claim your arrival

33
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:20,581
on my doorstep's
simply coincidence?
No.

34
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:22,816
I'm the one that had you knocked
out and left in the desert.

35
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,318
I see.

36
00:01:24,352 --> 00:01:25,619
That's all I did.

37
00:01:25,653 --> 00:01:28,856
So you're gonna blame everything
else on your eyeless stooge?

38
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:31,359
He wasn't a stooge.
He was my right-hand man.

39
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,593
Until you shot him dead.

40
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:35,129
Excellent way to repay
his loyalty, by the way.

41
00:01:35,163 --> 00:01:37,565
He went rogue.

42
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:40,134
I have no idea
why he did what he did.

43
00:01:40,168 --> 00:01:43,637
That's why I had
to take him out.

44
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:45,506
You know, for an immortal,

45
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:47,741
you really do bleed a lot,
don't you?

46
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:49,143
Yeah.

47
00:01:49,177 --> 00:01:50,544
I'm still human.
I still feel

48
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:53,147
all the pain that
comes with death.

49
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:55,449
It's just the wounds heal.

50
00:01:55,483 --> 00:01:58,152
Oh, sounds like a bitch.
Yeah, well, I don't
have to tell you

51
00:01:58,186 --> 00:02:00,688
what sort of sick sense of humor
your father has.

52
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:04,158
Which is why I'm surprised
that you're working with Him.

53
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:07,528
Well, there's no sense
in denying it now.

54
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:08,862
I know

55
00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:11,165
you gave me back
my wretched wings.

56
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:13,801
I know you took
my devil face.

57
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:17,305
So tell me, what did
He offer you in return?

58
00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:21,809
I would never work
for your father.

59
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:24,845
And I had nothing to do with
your wings or your devil face.

60
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:26,780
I don't believe you.

61
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:28,682
I don't care.

62
00:02:28,716 --> 00:02:30,218
(groans)

63
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:31,285
Now, after getting stabbed

64
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,721
and killing the closest thing
I had to a friend,

65
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:36,290
I've had a long day.

66
00:02:36,324 --> 00:02:37,891
Where do you think
you're going?

67
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:39,193
(groans)

68
00:02:39,227 --> 00:02:40,894
You can't just
walk out on me.

69
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:44,598
Or what?
You'll kill me?

70
00:02:46,234 --> 00:02:47,535
(groans)

71
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:49,970
I'll tell everyone
who you really are!

72
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,539
Go ahead.

73
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:54,242
They don't even believe
you're the Devil.

74
00:02:56,244 --> 00:02:57,511
(scoffs)

75
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:00,548
(yells)

76
00:03:02,283 --> 00:03:05,319
Maze, what the hell was that?

77
00:03:05,353 --> 00:03:07,521
Testing a new blade.

78
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:09,890
Making sure
it's kill ready.

79
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,058
It is.

80
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:14,862
Maze, you can't just throw
knives at Trixie's door.

81
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:16,564
It's dangerous, and
now we have to pay

82
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:18,832
to have this fixed.
Relax.

83
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,234
I got it covered.

84
00:03:20,268 --> 00:03:21,469
Trixie's already working on

85
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:22,970
another one of
her alien drawings.

86
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:25,373
(knife scraping)

87
00:03:25,406 --> 00:03:28,342
Is that why you've been putting
up all of Trixie's artwork?

88
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:30,010
To cover up the damage?
What?

89
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,845
Kid's got to make cash somehow.

90
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,514
Seriously, Maze?

91
00:03:34,382 --> 00:03:36,617
You live in a house with people.

92
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,887
Is it too much to ask for
just a little consideration?

93
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,256
(gasps)
This is that human thing

94
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,657
where you're mad about
something else

95
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:45,726
but you're taking it out
on me, right?

96
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,362
(sighs)

97
00:03:48,396 --> 00:03:49,897
I'm sorry.

98
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,231
I didn't mean to snap at you.

99
00:03:51,265 --> 00:03:54,768
I'm just, I'm-I'm upset about
what happened with Lucifer.

100
00:03:54,802 --> 00:03:55,703
Ah.

101
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,771
After everything he did--
betraying me,

102
00:03:57,805 --> 00:04:00,007
kidnapping a prisoner
right under my nose--

103
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,875
he hasn't even apologized yet.

104
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,878
(laughs) And?

105
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,814
And what? It's not funny.

106
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:09,750
I trusted him enough
to break the rules with him.

107
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:11,685
He didn't care
what happened to me.

108
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,854
All right.

109
00:04:15,323 --> 00:04:17,958
Look, you're upset.

110
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,560
I get it.

111
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,762
But you have to
understand, Chloe,

112
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:24,698
you're never gonna
change Lucifer.

113
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:26,700
He is who he is.

114
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:29,002
Yeah.

115
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:32,340
("Watch 'Em Fall" by
Beasts With No Name playing)

116
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:34,642
* Yeah, watch 'em fall... *

117
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:37,578
(camera clicking)

118
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,447
MAN:
I-It was so dark,

119
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,581
we couldn't see anything.

120
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,816
I thought it was just stupid
kids goofing around again.

121
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,318
MAN 2:
These transients

122
00:04:44,352 --> 00:04:47,054
keep coming through here
to get to our beach.

123
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:48,589
We can't stop them.

124
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:51,625
We put up signs,
but they just ignored them.

125
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:53,461
And now they're
committing murder.

126
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:56,897
I mean, what kind of monster
would do this?

127
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,999
That's what we're
gonna figure out.

128
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:00,901
Excuse me, please.

129
00:05:02,403 --> 00:05:04,338
CHLOE:
Hey, morning.

130
00:05:04,372 --> 00:05:05,473
What do we got?

131
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:07,375
Uh, a male vic,
24 years old,

132
00:05:07,408 --> 00:05:08,842
known as Manny
"The Moondog" Taylor.

133
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:09,810
Moondog?

134
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:10,978
Yeah, he's
a pro surfer.

135
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:13,614
Tops of the circuit three
out of the last five years.

136
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,750
And, man, if you only saw what
this kid could do. (exhales)

137
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:18,786
Wait a minute.
Are you surfing again?

138
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,489
Uh, I'm trying to get in
the water before work

139
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:23,857
as much as possible,
but you know how it is.

140
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:24,958
Yeah, only so many hours.

141
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,695
Yeah, that, and I'd never be
as good as this kid was.

142
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:29,497
CHLOE:
So, blunt force trauma

143
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,399
to the head is
cause of death, Ella?

144
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:32,400
Nope.

145
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:34,768
No? Okay. Then what is?

146
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:36,370
Choking.

147
00:05:36,404 --> 00:05:39,039
Like on a chicken bone?

148
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:41,975
Or did someone else do it
with their hands, or...?

149
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,644
Surf leash.

150
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,012
From his own board?

151
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:47,881
Not his own board.
No DNA.

152
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:50,083
Ella.

153
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:51,919
Are you okay?

154
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:53,487
Uh-huh.

155
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,757
Hey.

156
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,891
All right.

157
00:05:57,925 --> 00:05:59,192
Well, I guess we're looking
for another surfer, then.

158
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:02,730
Yeah, I'll start digging
into Manny's personals.
Wait. Hey.

159
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:04,798
Let's keep this quiet,
keep the press from pouncing.

160
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:06,834
Yeah.
LUCIFER:
It's okay, Detective!

161
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:10,438
I assume you got held up with
that needy offspring of yours

162
00:06:10,471 --> 00:06:12,806
and simply forgot to call,
but no matter.

163
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,542
I'm here.

164
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:16,910
Actually, I chose
not to call you.

165
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:18,278
Okay.

166
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,548
Well, whilst I'm sure there's a
perfectly reasonable explanation

167
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:21,682
for that, there's something
very important

168
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,150
I need to discuss
with you first.

169
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:25,886
Oh. Okay.
Um...

170
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,088
I need your help
investigating someone.

171
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,289
What?

172
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:31,692
Someone very clever and cunning,
but they're lying to me,

173
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,594
and it's imperative
I get to the truth.

174
00:06:35,463 --> 00:06:37,665
You came here to get my help?

175
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:39,467
Very much so, yes.
My help?

176
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,868
Are you having a senior moment?

177
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:44,872
No. No, I'm not having
a senior moment.

178
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,774
I'm finally
accepting you

179
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:49,977
for what you really are, which
is an egomaniacal narcissist!

180
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,212
But...

181
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,682
the only thing I can do...

182
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:57,485
is control how I respond.

183
00:06:57,518 --> 00:06:58,886
By helping me?

184
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,821
By working
without you today.

185
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:04,492
Time to go home and be with
the person you love most.

186
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:05,859
Yourself.

187
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:07,094
(Lucifer laughs)

188
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:10,531
Detective!

189
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,568
*

190
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:23,243
LINDA:
So Kane from the Bible

191
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,545
is alive.

192
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:26,480
Yes.

193
00:07:26,514 --> 00:07:27,447
Is he dangerous?

194
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:29,149
Oh, probably.
I mean, we are talking about

195
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:30,551
the world's first murderer.

196
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:31,852
His own brother, no less.

197
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:34,655
Mm. And if anyone can find out
what he's up to,

198
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:36,123
it's the detective.

199
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:37,591
I just...

200
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,960
I don't understand
why she won't help me.

201
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:43,531
May I remind you
that you did break her trust

202
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:44,765
and kidnap a man

203
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,066
while working on a case
together.

204
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:48,235
Well, technically,
we kidnapped each other.

205
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:52,205
The point is...
perhaps it would help

206
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:55,042
if you saw Chloe's perspective
for a change.

207
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,612
I mean, friendship is
a two-way street.

208
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:00,614
Yes, but right now,
mine is clearly

209
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:01,949
the more important lane.

210
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,084
Okay, let's try
a different tack.

211
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:07,821
Maybe, if you thought about
how your actions affected her,

212
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:11,258
she might be more receptive
to how you feel.

213
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,492
So what you're saying is

214
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:15,696
I need to make it
all about her for a change?

215
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:17,865
Exactly.

216
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:21,001
And then she can make it
all about me.

217
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:23,571
Oh, that is brilliant, Doctor.

218
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:25,573
Yes.

219
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:27,140
Very good.

220
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:30,243
Should've seen that one coming.

221
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:32,212
MAN:
What the hell was that, Manny?!

222
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:34,948
Hey, don't blame me 'cause you
cherry bombed your wave, dude.

223
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:35,983
I'm done with you.

224
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,651
You're dead, you hear me?!

225
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:39,820
You're totally dead!

226
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,088
Walk away.

227
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,256
This is "Dangerous Doug" Libby,

228
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,093
a nationally-ranked surfer
with a known history with Manny.

229
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:48,829
This fight took place
a week ago at Bells Beach.

230
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,764
Mm. It speaks
to motive,

231
00:08:50,798 --> 00:08:52,132
but there's no
connection to the crime.

232
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:53,867
You can't get a
search warrant

233
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:55,202
for something as
flimsy as that.

234
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:57,705
At least, I wouldn't
give it to you.

235
00:08:57,738 --> 00:08:59,640
Oh.

236
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:01,875
You know, Doug is
supposed to compete

237
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:04,144
at the Huntington
Swell Classic later.

238
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:07,715
If I can get him to voluntarily
turn over his surf leash,

239
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:10,250
can you match that to the wound
on Manny's throat?

240
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:12,853
Sure.

241
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,188
Okay. I'll update
the lieutenant.

242
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:20,761
You are not being
your excessively

243
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:22,295
cheery self today.
What gives?

244
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:26,667
Fine, don't tell me.

245
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,637
Pierce yelled at me yesterday.

246
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,941
He said that I talk too much.

247
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:39,312
So I'm trying to talk less.

248
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:44,184
If I fell apart
every time a man told me

249
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:46,319
the he didn't like
what I was doing,

250
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:48,321
I'd be in a million pieces
right now.

251
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:51,024
But instead, I pushed through,
rose through the ranks,

252
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:54,895
built my own firm,
and here I am.

253
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,064
In this entry-level D.A. job.

254
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:00,968
But he's like a hero of mine.

255
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:02,202
You need to get a thicker skin.

256
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:04,938
Stand up for yourself,
because the truth is,

257
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:06,674
nobody's gonna do it for you.

258
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:07,641
(briefcase snaps closed)

259
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,413
Hey, Lieutenant.

260
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,182
Hey.

261
00:10:16,884 --> 00:10:18,151
You going somewhere?

262
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:19,820
I put in for a transfer.

263
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:21,021
Only a few days left here.

264
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:23,757
Wow. That was fast.

265
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,125
What can I say? I got pull.

266
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:26,927
Uh, no, no. That's
not what I mean.

267
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,261
I-I just mean, why?

268
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:31,131
This, uh, about what
happened with the Sinnerman?

269
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:34,001
It's about a lot of things.

270
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:36,136
I thought coming here
would fix some of them,

271
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:38,706
but nothing changes,
not for me.

272
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:41,141
Well, maybe you should take
some time to think about it.

273
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:43,043
You know? Just, um...

274
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:45,012
Look, I know how hard it is,

275
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:47,347
and confusing it is
to deal with a shooting,

276
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,417
and, um, if you ever need
anyone to talk to...

277
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,484
It's done, okay?

278
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:54,087
Let's not make a big deal
out of this, Decker.

279
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,025
AMENADIEL:
You know,

280
00:10:58,058 --> 00:10:58,926
I just don't understand it.

281
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,460
I've never had
a human illness before.

282
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,763
But sore throat,

283
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:04,164
itchy eyes, a fever...

284
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:06,066
Is it a cold? The flu?

285
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:07,768
It's chlamydia.

286
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:09,402
Excuse me?

287
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:11,204
It's a sexually
transmitted disease.

288
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:12,940
Right, but I can't
have chlamydia.

289
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:14,107
I'm an angel.

290
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:17,477
Not to worry.

291
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,780
A round of antibiotics

292
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:21,782
and you'll be back
to your, uh,

293
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:23,116
angelic ways.

294
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:26,787
Now, the important thing
is to focus on next steps.

295
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,121
Do you know
how you got it?

296
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:29,289
I have no idea.

297
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:32,726
Well, have you been engaging
in any risky sexual behavior?

298
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:37,164
Well, I did have sex
with a prostitute.

299
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:41,268
But I...

300
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:43,937
didn't know
she was a prostitute.

301
00:11:43,971 --> 00:11:45,205
Uh-huh.

302
00:11:46,974 --> 00:11:49,276
I've also been making love
to an amazing woman

303
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:51,044
who I have genuine feelings for.

304
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:55,148
But we have a mutual friend
that doesn't want us together,

305
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:59,086
and she is not one
to be trifled with, so...

306
00:12:01,989 --> 00:12:03,423
It's, um...

307
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,458
complicated.

308
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:08,228
Right. Call all
your recent partners,

309
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:10,163
even the ones
before the prostitute

310
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:12,299
just in case it wasn't her.

311
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:14,101
They all need to be tested.

312
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:16,937
("Good For You"
by Apache Rifles playing)

313
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,072
* When I found

314
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:21,074
* Somebody new

315
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:23,543
* To put my

316
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,345
* Time into

317
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:27,881
* Yeah, love's a bitch *

318
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:30,050
* Come on, stick it out...

319
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,985
Hello, Detective.

320
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:34,988
Lovely day for a bit of sunshine
and sand, don't you think?

321
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:37,057
Lucifer, why are you here?

322
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,292
Well, I realize
that I have been remiss

323
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:41,494
in prioritizing you
in our friendship.

324
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:43,296
So I'd like
to make it up to you

325
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,199
by deeming today Detective Day.

326
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:48,301
What does that even mean?

327
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:50,137
Well, it means
that for the rest of the day,

328
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,305
everything that I do
shall be for you.

329
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:54,141
Thanks, but I'm working a case.

330
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:55,408
Ah, now, I know

331
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,177
that you need
to get close

332
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,912
to Mr. Dangerous Doug Libby.

333
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:00,914
But since you don't have
a warrant, you need to do so

334
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:02,182
without blowing your cover.
Am I right?

335
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:03,917
Maybe.

336
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:06,053
Well, that's gonna be
quite difficult, isn't it?

337
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:08,321
Unless, of course...

338
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:10,423
someone signed you up
for the competition.

339
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:13,093
This might actually help.

340
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,062
Yes, I know.
But wait!

341
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:16,529
There's more.

342
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:19,132
Now, since you're
going in undercover,

343
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,935
why not do it
with a little panache?

344
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:23,203
(laughs)

345
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:25,305
Nice try.
I'm not putting that on.

346
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:27,107
But I will keep the access pass.

347
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,176
Right.

348
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:31,178
Uh, Detective?
What?!

349
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:32,379
Well, you don't want to damage

350
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:34,447
that perfect skin of yours,
now, do you?

351
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:35,515
So...

352
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:38,151
how should we get close
to this Dangerous Doug?

353
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:40,553
You do nothing.
I'll handle this.

354
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:43,223
(man speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

355
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:44,958
CHLOE:
Hey, there.

356
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:46,593
Dangerous Doug?

357
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:49,196
I just wanted to say hi.
I-I'm such a huge fan.

358
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:52,565
Well, aloha.

359
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:54,968
(laughs) I'm, um,
I'm new to the circuit.

360
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:56,303
I joined down in San Diego.

361
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,271
It's nice to meet you.

362
00:13:58,305 --> 00:13:59,973
Who's the sugar daddy?

363
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:02,109
What?

364
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:03,977
Oh. Oh.

365
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:05,278
(chuckles) Him.

366
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:07,214
He's-he's just...
He's my sponsor.

367
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:08,248
He's totally
overbearing

368
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:09,917
and absolutely not needed.

369
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,520
Right.

370
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:15,522
So, anyhow, I just wanted to see

371
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:17,490
if maybe you'd want to
go surfing sometime.

372
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,392
I found this really
rad beach up in Malibu.

373
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:21,528
It's, um, called Carbon.

374
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:23,130
Oh, yeah, I've been there.

375
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:24,331
I know all the secret beaches.

376
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,166
Well, I just,
I really admire your style,

377
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:29,236
and, you know, I'd love
to check out your board--

378
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:31,338
Is-is this your board?
Oh, yeah.

379
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,672
Oh, yeah. Oh.
This right here,

380
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,142
this is my Bonzer.
She's great on turns.

381
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:36,509
Perfect for roundhouses.

382
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,912
She's insane
in the barrel.

383
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:40,247
So, Dougy,

384
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,582
did you, uh, hurt yourself?

385
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,651
No. Why?

386
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:47,921
Looks like someone bit it
really hard here.

387
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:50,257
Did you hit someone?

388
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,559
Who'd you say you were again?

389
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:56,296
MAN (over P.A.): Next up,
Chloe "The Detective" Decker.

390
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:03,036
Got to be kidding me.

391
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,237
You're a cop?

392
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:05,238
Sorry, Dougy.

393
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:06,273
LAPD.

394
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:08,275
LUCIFER:
Sorry!

395
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:10,143
I'm afraid
this is evidence, Dougy.

396
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:11,945
Let go!
Okay.

397
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,714
(Lucifer sighs)

398
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,216
(chuckles) See?

399
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,985
Detective Day.

400
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:24,491
(elevator bell dings)

401
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:26,393
Now, wasn't that refreshing?

402
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,528
A lovely day at the beach,
and you caught a murderer.

403
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:31,064
It's like the whole world
revolves around you, Detective.

404
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:32,299
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

405
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:34,201
We still need to get a
confession out of Doug

406
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:35,969
or match the blood
on the board to Manny.

407
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:37,204
Well, whatever you
need, Detective.

408
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:38,671
I am solely here for you.

409
00:15:38,705 --> 00:15:40,974
Look, I know what you're doing.

410
00:15:41,008 --> 00:15:42,742
Being the most selfless devil
you've ever met?

411
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,345
You're only helping me
so that I help you back,

412
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:48,348
which is actually worse
than not helping me at all.

413
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:50,150
So thanks but no thanks.

414
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:51,751
But, Detective,
surely you can appreciate

415
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,021
a benevolent gesture.
Save it.

416
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:55,522
Lucifer, I know this case
doesn't matter to you.

417
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:57,490
That's not...
Ready?

418
00:15:57,524 --> 00:15:59,159
Yeah.

419
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,532
DOUG:
He's dead, isn't he?

420
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:07,134
Yes, Doug. He's dead.

421
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,569
Oh, God.
I can't believe it.

422
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:11,371
I'm totally a killer.

423
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:14,141
Look-look, you don't understand.
He-he just came out of nowhere.

424
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:16,509
All right,
just calm down.

425
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:19,712
Take a breath and take
us through everything.

426
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:22,749
From the beginning, okay?

427
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:24,284
I was surfing, man,

428
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,019
and I caught
this killer wave, and...

429
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:27,687
he just came out of nowhere.

430
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,157
I slammed into him
with my board.

431
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,292
God, there was so much blood.

432
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,261
It was everywhere.
God.

433
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:37,664
Anytime I close my eyes,
I can...

434
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:39,632
can hear that awful sound.

435
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,268
He just wouldn't stop barking.

436
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:44,571
Um, I'm sorry.
Did you say barking?

437
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:46,739
That poor seal. I killed him.

438
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:49,776
I killed the dog of the sea.

439
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:50,910
Hold on a second. You...

440
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,546
you think you're here
'cause you killed a seal?

441
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,747
Yeah.

442
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:56,249
Why else would I be here?

443
00:16:56,283 --> 00:16:58,085
Well...

444
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:04,724
Whoa.

445
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:06,359
Manny's dead, too?

446
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:12,299
Oh. Pardon me.

447
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,336
Cream? Sugar?

448
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:19,472
Or do you take it
dark and bitter like your soul?

449
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:21,608
Uh... (chuckles)

450
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:23,210
What?

451
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:26,679
Do you enjoy beating up on
your subordinates, Mr. Pierce?

452
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,615
Is that why you became
a lieutenant?

453
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:30,750
(scoffs)

454
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:32,585
Have we even met?

455
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:33,686
Oh, Charlotte Richards.

456
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,222
I'm your new prosecutor,

457
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:37,124
and you are
just that kind of bully

458
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:39,526
that makes me miss
my old self.

459
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:42,229
If I wasn't on the road
to virtue and righteousness,

460
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:44,764
I would crush you
like a cockroach.

461
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,466
I believe you. (chuckles)

462
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:48,501
But, look, I don't know
what this is about.

463
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:50,237
I'm sorry
if I offended you somehow.

464
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,639
Oh, I'm not the one
you should be apologizing to.

465
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:54,241
Ella Lopez

466
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:56,776
may be astonishingly perky
and optimistic,

467
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:59,646
but she doesn't deserve to have
her spirit crushed by anyone,

468
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,381
especially not
a man who,

469
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:05,552
for some unknown reason,
she looks up to.

470
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:14,427
Hmm. Shame on you.

471
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:24,804
Ah, Detective, please.
I really need your... (sighs)

472
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,739
Ah, Detective Douche.

473
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,142
Daniel. Sorry. Sorry, old habit.

474
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:30,643
I think it's because
I'm distressed,

475
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:32,645
and I need your advice.

476
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:34,814
(sighs)
Now, you've managed

477
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:36,883
to offend the detective
more than anyone,

478
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,186
to the point where
she actually divorced you.

479
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:41,288
Yet, you always seem
to bounce back. How?

480
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:44,491
Okay, first off...
Hmm.

481
00:18:44,524 --> 00:18:46,826
our divorce was mutual.

482
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:49,429
Mm-hmm. Right. And?

483
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,864
And it's not brain surgery, man.
Y-You just...

484
00:18:51,898 --> 00:18:54,434
You got to find a way...

485
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,636
to be thoughtful
without getting in her face.

486
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:01,541
Like, this one time,
I made her breakfast in bed.

487
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:05,612
French toast, whipped
cream, homemade jam.

488
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,680
Man, she really loved it.

489
00:19:07,714 --> 00:19:09,182
And, you know, maybe

490
00:19:09,216 --> 00:19:11,618
if I had done
more things like that, sh...

491
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,353
Sh...

492
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:16,589
I wouldn't be standing alone,
talking to myself.

493
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:21,428
MAZE:
This is the RX-5500.

494
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:23,263
World's most deadly
hunting knife.

495
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:25,465
Made with
Friction Forging,

496
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:29,302
it's so sharp it can literally
cut bone like butter.

497
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:32,772
And now...

498
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:34,741
I want you

499
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:36,776
to get what
you deserve.

500
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:38,378
Oh, God.

501
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:39,879
(laughs):
It's a gift, stupid.

502
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,981
(chuckles nervously)

503
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,851
For being such a great friend.

504
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:47,387
Look, I really appreciate
how you handled

505
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:51,424
the whole me not wanting you
and Amenadiel to bone thing.

506
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:54,761
This is unnecessary, Maze.

507
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:55,862
Stop it.

508
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:58,431
Okay? You deserve it.

509
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,969
Look...

510
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:06,606
there's something
I need to tell you.

511
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:09,342
(phone vibrating, ringtone
playing theme from Psycho)
Oh.

512
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:14,581
What?

513
00:20:14,614 --> 00:20:15,815
Uh-huh.

514
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:17,784
Yeah. Is that it?
Whatever.

515
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:20,320
(scoffs)

516
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:21,821
Stupid Amenadiel.

517
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:23,290
Sorry. You were saying?

518
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:25,425
Is everything okay?
Eh, no big deal.

519
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:28,328
He's just whining
about having chlamydia.

520
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:33,666
(chuckles):
Yeah.

521
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,935
Dodged that bullet, huh?

522
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:38,638
Yep.

523
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:40,407
Bullet dodged, all right.

524
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,445
(sighs)

525
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:47,614
Hey. So, forensics came back,

526
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:49,882
and I can't believe
I'm saying this.

527
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,452
Blood on the board?
Definitely seal blood.

528
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:54,554
(sighs) Well,
I did some digging myself.

529
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,889
Apparently there is
a Huntington surf gang

530
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:58,057
known as the Orcas.

531
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,592
Know what their M.O. is?

532
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:01,060
Using surf leashes
to choke people

533
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,595
and scare them off their turf.

534
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:04,964
Any confirmed murders?
No, not yet.

535
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:06,366
But there's always a first.

536
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:07,634
Their leader,
known as Wildchild,

537
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:09,702
has been picked up
almost a dozen times

538
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:12,472
for battery, vandalism,
assault with a deadly weapon.

539
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:15,342
These guys do not mess around.

540
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,009
Okay, but if the Orcas
are from Huntington Beach,

541
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:18,611
what were they doing
up at Carbon?

542
00:21:18,645 --> 00:21:19,612
According to these,

543
00:21:19,646 --> 00:21:22,014
the Orcas tag
was recently put up all around

544
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,683
where Manny's
body was found.

545
00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:25,618
So, I don't know.
Maybe they're expanding?

546
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:28,621
Okay, only problem is a graffiti
tag doesn't prove murder.

547
00:21:28,655 --> 00:21:30,590
Right. We need leverage.

548
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:34,761
We need to force one of
the Orcas to roll over. But how?

549
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,763
These surfers are like a tribe.

550
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:39,766
I have an idea.

551
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,434
This isn't a good idea.

552
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:44,671
Trust me. It's gonna work.

553
00:21:44,704 --> 00:21:46,639
*

554
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,451
Okay, maybe it'll work.

555
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,594
CHLOE (over radio):
Dan, do you see anything?

556
00:22:07,627 --> 00:22:08,995
I see some Orcas,

557
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:11,731
but no sign
of their big bad leader yet.

558
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:13,800
Don't let your guard down
just yet.

559
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,001
Wildchild just pulled up.

560
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:16,469
Should be coming
at you any minute.

561
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:18,705
Are you sure
Epinoza's up for this?

562
00:22:18,738 --> 00:22:20,573
He's fine.
All he has to do

563
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:23,443
is get the Orcas riled enough
that they try and rough him up.

564
00:22:23,476 --> 00:22:26,078
He yells the safe word, we
move in; it's a piece of cake.

565
00:22:26,112 --> 00:22:27,847
Although, I don't know
how I'm supposed

566
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,549
to get "surfs up"
casually in a sentence.

567
00:22:29,582 --> 00:22:31,851
I mean, maybe we should consider
using a different safe word.

568
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:33,420
PIERCE:
Good luck, Espinoza.

569
00:22:33,453 --> 00:22:34,153
Copy.

570
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,822
All right, Dan,
you're up.

571
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,490
Wildchild's
on the beach.

572
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:38,791
How do I look?

573
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:39,992
You look like
you're about to get

574
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:41,794
your ass kicked by a girl.

575
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:46,599

jaw, remember that the Orcas

579
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:57,944
don't move a muscle
without Wildchild's nod.

580
00:22:57,977 --> 00:23:00,413
So stay on task, okay?

581
00:23:00,447 --> 00:23:01,848
Trust me.

582
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,483
I know how to tick off a lady.

583
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:09,956
No, Mazikeen, I don't think
the detective wants a knife.

584
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:12,492
I'm trying to be
thoughtful here.

585
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:15,127
Hello?

586
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:16,929
(laughs)

587
00:23:16,963 --> 00:23:19,398
Well, someone's in a mood today.

588
00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:24,537
What, as if the detective
doesn't have

589
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:27,607
enough on her plate already!

590
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,542
Deary me...

591
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:36,816
Good thing for her she's got
a partner to pick up the slack.

592
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:39,819

00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:54,166
* Ah.

596
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,002
Right.

597
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:58,070
Now what do I do?

598
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:00,072
Okay, I've done
everything I can imagine

599
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:01,941
to be helpful
to the detective,

600
00:24:01,974 --> 00:24:03,910
and I'm literally
out of ideas.

601
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:06,713
Can you think of anything?

602
00:24:06,746 --> 00:24:10,116
No. But you know
what would help me?

603
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:13,085
You... scrubbing
these test tubes.

604
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:15,087
I want them spick-and-span.

605
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:16,122
And, if you don't mind,

606
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:18,491
how about you do it
with a frickin' smile!

607
00:24:18,525 --> 00:24:20,527
Are you feeling all right,
Ms. Lopez?

608
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,962
This isn't me, is it?

609
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:24,664
Afraid not. No. Uh...

610
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:27,567
(sighs)
I'm sorry, okay? I'm just...

611
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,268
I'm trying to practice

612
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,270
standing up for myself
against Pierce.

613
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,272
And I've got, like,
no time to figure it out,

614
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,741
'cause he's leaving soon...
Wait.

615
00:24:34,774 --> 00:24:36,075
What do you mean
Pierce is leaving?

616
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:37,143
Yeah. Didn't you hear?

617
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:39,612
He's about to transfer
out of the department.

618
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:42,214
(sighs)
No. No, no, no.

619
00:24:44,851 --> 00:24:46,753
Good job.

PIERCE:
I guess we finally

633
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,097
found Espinoza's true calling.

634
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,732
Pissing people off.

635
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:35,868
I might actually miss
making fun of that guy.

636
00:25:35,902 --> 00:25:38,337
Maybe you don't have to.

637
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,607
I mean, you might
find this surprising, but...

638
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,977
Dan has become way more
fond of you lately.

639
00:25:45,011 --> 00:25:47,246
And I-I think
he appreciates your quirks,

640
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,717
and I'm pretty sure
he's gonna miss you.

641
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,718
He is?

642
00:25:51,751 --> 00:25:52,852
Mm-hmm.

643
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:54,821
And so might... some others.

644
00:25:54,854 --> 00:25:57,223
You know?

645
00:25:57,256 --> 00:26:00,693
But point is, maybe
you don't have to go.

646
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:01,728
(door opens)

647
00:26:01,761 --> 00:26:03,362
Ah! There you are.

648
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,832
What, did you come to make it
"all about me" again?

649
00:26:05,865 --> 00:26:07,333
Nope. It's all
about him now.

I'm letting him leave town

00:26:12,672 --> 00:26:15,307

(sighs)

654
00:26:19,045 --> 00:26:21,013
Keep an eye on Dan, will you?

655
00:26:21,047 --> 00:26:22,749
After all, this is a sting.

656
00:26:22,782 --> 00:26:24,784
You know, a sting?

657
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:25,985
(sighs)

658
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:27,954
(doors close)

659
00:26:27,987 --> 00:26:29,822
I want answers.

660
00:26:29,856 --> 00:26:32,091
(laughs)
You want answers?

661
00:26:32,124 --> 00:26:34,093
Mm. (chuckles)
Okay.

662
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:35,762
(chuckles)

663
00:26:35,795 --> 00:26:37,864
Fine.

664
00:26:37,897 --> 00:26:40,132
Go ahead.

665
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:41,968
Do your thing.

666
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:44,036
What?

667
00:26:44,971 --> 00:26:47,073
Ask me!
Oh.

668
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:51,110
Very well... Kane.

669
00:26:52,879 --> 00:26:55,682
What is it that you desire?

670
00:26:55,715 --> 00:26:58,050
I want...

671
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,655
...to die.

672
00:27:02,689 --> 00:27:03,790
What?

673
00:27:03,823 --> 00:27:06,058
To die? I...

674
00:27:07,894 --> 00:27:11,130
What does that have to do
with coming here, or me?

675
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:13,099
It has nothing to do with you.

676
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:17,003
And everything to do with her.

677
00:27:17,036 --> 00:27:20,707
But... why?

678
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,209
I don't understand.

679
00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:27,246
What does the detective
have to do with wanting to die?

680
00:27:32,118 --> 00:27:33,085
I've walked this Earth
for thousands of years.

681
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:35,221
I have seen everything,
I have done everything.

682
00:27:35,254 --> 00:27:37,223
I have watched everything
I've ever known

683
00:27:37,256 --> 00:27:39,792
turn to ashes
over and over again.

684
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:41,828
It's almost like you're in...

685
00:27:41,861 --> 00:27:45,031
Hell? Yeah.

686
00:27:45,064 --> 00:27:49,135
And I've been searching
for a way out forever.

687
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:52,271
Keeping an eye on
every celestial on Earth

688
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:53,740
and what they're doing.

689
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:58,077
How and why they seem
to come and go.

690
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:00,179
So imagine my surprise
when I find out

691
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:04,016
there's a detective who somehow
made the Devil bleed.

692
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,122
For the first time, I had hope.

693
00:28:10,156 --> 00:28:12,892
Maybe she could do for me
what she did for you.

694
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:14,961
Then finally you'd be free.

695
00:28:14,994 --> 00:28:16,162
Yeah.

696
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:17,496
Then why kidnap me?

697
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,266
Because in order
to test my theory,

698
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:22,168
I needed you out of the way.

699
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:27,907
So I hired someone to knock
you out when Chloe was close.

700
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,845
Then you sprouted wings
and came back early,

701
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:34,346
and screwed up
the entire plan.

702
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,249
So I had to think on the fly.

703
00:28:37,283 --> 00:28:39,285
Hold on.

704
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:41,253
The shooter at the ranch?

705
00:28:41,287 --> 00:28:42,388
Yeah.

706
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:43,990
You let him know
you were coming?

707
00:28:44,023 --> 00:28:47,293
Hoping he'd react
the way that he did?

708
00:28:47,326 --> 00:28:49,461
You put the detective in danger!

709
00:28:49,495 --> 00:28:53,833
And even then, with Chloe
right beside me, it didn't work.

710
00:28:55,334 --> 00:28:58,805
So that little bit
of hope I had?

711
00:28:58,838 --> 00:29:00,272
It's gone.

712
00:29:00,306 --> 00:29:02,441
Oh, boo-hoo.

713
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:04,176
(scoffs)

714
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:07,413
What about everything else
that happened to me?

715
00:29:08,948 --> 00:29:11,017
Honestly, I don't know.

716
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:18,791
You're telling the truth.

717
00:29:22,361 --> 00:29:24,096
(exhales sharply)

718
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:29,301
Stage one's complete.

719
00:29:29,335 --> 00:29:32,204
But I got to tell you,
I think these guys are all talk.

720
00:29:32,238 --> 00:29:34,240
I've pissed every single one
of them off,

721
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:35,842
and no one's moved yet.

722
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,349
Oh, hey, guys.

723
00:29:43,382 --> 00:29:45,217
What's up?

724
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:51,223
Dan?

725
00:29:51,257 --> 00:29:53,459
Dan, are you all right?

726
00:29:55,094 --> 00:29:57,496
Wow.

727
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:00,266
I guess that means surf's up.

728
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,606
I said, surf's up.

729
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,842
Did I just
knock something loose,

730
00:30:09,876 --> 00:30:11,911
or are you always this lame?

731
00:30:11,944 --> 00:30:15,147
Well, you didn't think that a...

732
00:30:15,181 --> 00:30:17,549
that a punch was gonna
scare me off, did you?

733
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:20,152
No.

734
00:30:21,888 --> 00:30:23,422
Should've just
walked away, kook.

735
00:30:23,455 --> 00:30:25,958
I guess that's, uh...

736
00:30:25,992 --> 00:30:27,927
that's how it went down
for Moondog, huh?

737
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,062
What'd you say?

738
00:30:30,096 --> 00:30:35,067
I-I said that must have been
what you did to my boy Moondog.

739
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:36,535
Before he died.

740
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:40,539
Doesn't make any sense.

741
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:42,074
I mean, there must
have been a reason

742
00:30:42,108 --> 00:30:43,409
my wings appeared
at that moment.

743
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:44,977
There has to have been.

744
00:30:45,011 --> 00:30:48,080
Maybe, but it wasn't
because of me.

745
00:30:50,616 --> 00:30:53,352
I lost audio on Dan.
What's going on?

746
00:30:53,385 --> 00:30:55,054
Is that blood?

747
00:30:55,087 --> 00:30:56,188
Well, I mean, that could mean

748
00:30:56,222 --> 00:30:57,924
any number of things,
couldn't it?

749
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:01,961
They couldn't have
gotten far. He's injured.

750
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:11,870
What in the hell
are they doing?

751
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,651
It's a paddle-out ceremony.

752
00:31:27,453 --> 00:31:31,023
WILDCHILD: When you told us
Manny was dead, I was stunned.

753
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:33,192
'Cause Moondog was like
one of us--

754
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:37,029
a free spirit who wanted
to be one with the ocean.

755
00:31:38,664 --> 00:31:41,500
At least now we know he is.

756
00:31:41,533 --> 00:31:44,403
Go ahead.

757
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:46,472
Say something.

758
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:49,141
Uh...

759
00:31:49,175 --> 00:31:51,510
Manny was...

760
00:31:51,543 --> 00:31:53,112
a great guy.

761
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:55,381
And he meant

762
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:58,184
so much to...

763
00:31:58,217 --> 00:31:59,485
a lot of people,

764
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:00,652
which is why

765
00:32:00,686 --> 00:32:02,688
I came here today
to find his killer.

766
00:32:05,457 --> 00:32:07,526
I thought it was
one of you guys.

767
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:10,262
Why would you think that, man?

768
00:32:10,296 --> 00:32:12,131
'Cause he was strangled
by a surf leash.

769
00:32:12,164 --> 00:32:13,966
And the Orcas' tags
are all over Carbon,

770
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,702
which is where
his body was found.

771
00:32:16,735 --> 00:32:18,170
That's crazy.

772
00:32:18,204 --> 00:32:21,640
Yeah, maybe,
but I saw it myself.

773
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:24,076
We don't
go up to Carbon.

774
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:26,378
Those private beaches
are all blocked off.

775
00:32:26,412 --> 00:32:28,514
Those rich snobs make it clear
we're not welcome there,

776
00:32:28,547 --> 00:32:30,649
so why bother?

777
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:35,021
The ocean's a big place.

778
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:39,158
(sighs)
Now, enough of that.

779
00:32:39,191 --> 00:32:42,328
Let's take this moment.

780
00:32:42,361 --> 00:32:44,330
For Moondog.

781
00:32:46,532 --> 00:32:47,733
For Moondog.

782
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:50,336
ALL:
Moondog.

783
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:55,307
(whooping)

784
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:05,451
DAN: I'm telling you guys,
I believe them.

785
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:08,020
Why? Just 'cause they put
flowers in the water?

786
00:33:08,054 --> 00:33:10,056
No. Because they didn't
know I was a cop,

787
00:33:10,089 --> 00:33:11,290
and their motive's
all but vanished.

788
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:13,125
I think someone's
trying to set them up.

789
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:15,094
I mean, they don't
even go up to Carbon.

790
00:33:15,127 --> 00:33:16,262
It's too much
of a hassle.

791
00:33:16,295 --> 00:33:18,630
Sloth-- truly one of the world's
most deplorable sins.

792
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:20,166
If you want something,

793
00:33:20,199 --> 00:33:22,468
you have to be willing
to go the extra mile.

794
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:24,036
(imitates trumpet fanfare)

795
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,704
What do you think?

796
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:28,240
I'm particularly proud
of the new filing system,

797
00:33:28,274 --> 00:33:30,442
complete with a
"Sexy Victims" pile,

798
00:33:30,476 --> 00:33:31,643
"Obvious Killers" pile.

799
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:34,546
Oh, and "Boring Crimes" pile,
to be ignored, of course.

800
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,382
Cannot even.
Cannot even.

801
00:33:36,415 --> 00:33:38,750
Should have gone with
the French toast.

802
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:45,391
As if it wasn't bad enough
you betrayed me,

803
00:33:45,424 --> 00:33:48,260
nearly costing me my job,
almost getting Dan killed...

804
00:33:48,294 --> 00:33:50,462
I mean, did you really think
I was dumb enough

805
00:33:50,496 --> 00:33:53,332
to help you just because
you tried to clean up my desk

806
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:55,267
and actually made it worse?

807
00:33:55,301 --> 00:33:57,336
I mean, what even is that?

808
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:58,204
It's me.

809
00:33:58,237 --> 00:34:00,772
Are you that self-absorbed

810
00:34:00,806 --> 00:34:04,276
that you don't realize
how your actions hurt people?

811
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,411
Hurt me?

812
00:34:05,444 --> 00:34:07,113
Detective.
And I can only assume

813
00:34:07,146 --> 00:34:09,148
that you asked Pierce
for help, too,

814
00:34:09,181 --> 00:34:10,816
which is nuts, by the way.

815
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:13,419
But I want to make
one thing clear:

816
00:34:13,452 --> 00:34:16,155
you can just stop
with this selfless charade,

817
00:34:16,188 --> 00:34:18,224
because I am never
going to help you

818
00:34:18,257 --> 00:34:19,758
with this investigation
of yours.

819
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,560
Oh, I don't need
your help anymore.

820
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:23,529
Then why are you still here?

821
00:34:25,364 --> 00:34:28,134
Because this case
matters to you.

822
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:30,136
Therefore, it matters to me.

823
00:34:30,169 --> 00:34:33,205
We're... we're partners,
Detective.

824
00:34:37,643 --> 00:34:41,613
(sighs) Next time,
you want to just start there?

825
00:34:41,647 --> 00:34:43,182
Next time. So we're...?

826
00:34:43,215 --> 00:34:45,517
(sighs) Okay.

827
00:34:45,551 --> 00:34:46,852
(sighs)

828
00:34:46,885 --> 00:34:48,354
"Hot Suspects"?

829
00:34:48,387 --> 00:34:50,356
An entire folder for graffiti?

830
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:52,724
This is gonna take me forever
to re-sort, you know.

831
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:53,925
No, wait, w-what
are you doing?

832
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:56,428
It took me ages to line
up these right angles.
(sighs)

833
00:34:56,462 --> 00:34:59,298
Holy crap.
That's it. You did it.

834
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:00,899
Okay, Detective,
I get it.

835
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,434
You don't like the
new filing system.

836
00:35:02,468 --> 00:35:04,170
But this is a bit excessive.
No.

837
00:35:04,203 --> 00:35:05,337
The Orcas.
Remember how they said

838
00:35:05,371 --> 00:35:07,573
that they never go up to Carbon
because it's private?

839
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:10,442
California has no private
beaches, which means...

840
00:35:10,476 --> 00:35:12,611
Someone must have put
the signs up illegally.

841
00:35:12,644 --> 00:35:15,414
And look here.

842
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:17,849
One person was cited
dozens of times

843
00:35:17,883 --> 00:35:19,451
for posting at Carbon.

844
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:24,523
To you, Detective.

845
00:35:27,593 --> 00:35:29,127
(chuckles)

846
00:35:36,335 --> 00:35:37,669
Hey! Hey.

847
00:35:37,703 --> 00:35:39,571
What do you think
you're doing?

848
00:35:39,605 --> 00:35:41,840
This is private
property.

849
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:42,941
Didn't you see the signs?

850
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,510
Oh, I'm so sorry.

851
00:35:44,543 --> 00:35:45,611
I must have missed those.

852
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:47,179
Did you happen to see them?

853
00:35:47,213 --> 00:35:48,180
No.

854
00:35:48,214 --> 00:35:49,848
No.

855
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:52,384
You know, someone must have
taken them down.

856
00:35:52,418 --> 00:35:55,521
I don't know who
you two think you are,

857
00:35:55,554 --> 00:35:57,256
but I'm calling the police.

858
00:35:57,289 --> 00:35:58,924
What, you mean
like those police?

859
00:35:58,957 --> 00:36:01,927
The beach signs you posted
are illegal, Justine,

860
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,596
and you know what that
helps with? A search warrant.

861
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,432
I wonder if
the officers will find

862
00:36:06,465 --> 00:36:07,699
anything of interest
in there.

863
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:10,336
Yes, I wonder.
Maybe a surf leash

864
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:12,471
used to strangle a
young surfer, perhaps.

865
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,740
I don't know what
you're talking about.

866
00:36:14,773 --> 00:36:16,475
This is insane.

867
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,410
Oh, come on,
tell us the truth.

868
00:36:18,444 --> 00:36:19,711
Did he steal from you?

869
00:36:19,745 --> 00:36:21,380
Hmm? Did he
owe you cash?

870
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:23,949
Or perhaps it was some kind of
sexual liaison that went awry.

871
00:36:23,982 --> 00:36:24,816
Really, I must know.

872
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:27,319
What the hell is wrong
with you people?

873
00:36:27,353 --> 00:36:30,989
You come to my house
and accuse me of murder?

874
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,991
This isn't your home, Justine.

875
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,327
This beach doesn't belong
to anyone.

876
00:36:35,361 --> 00:36:36,995
But that was the problem,
wasn't it?

877
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,865
You are wasting your time here.

878
00:36:39,898 --> 00:36:43,302
Manny came here to surf,
you had enough, and you snapped.

879
00:36:43,335 --> 00:36:45,003
No, that's not true.

880
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,238
Well, you say
that, Justine,

881
00:36:46,272 --> 00:36:49,941
but the police officer up there
holding a surfboard says yes.

882
00:36:49,975 --> 00:36:51,877
(chuckles)

883
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,979
Sorry.
You were saying?

884
00:36:55,681 --> 00:36:57,015
You don't get it.

885
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,618
I paid for this land.

886
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:01,287
I even put up signs,
but they trampled

887
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,389
this whole beach
like it was their own.

888
00:37:03,422 --> 00:37:05,023
They trashed
this whole area,

889
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,259
and I just couldn't
take it anymore.

890
00:37:07,293 --> 00:37:08,860
I-I had to send a message.

891
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:11,797
And that's why you framed
the Orcas for Manny's murder.

892
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:14,366
JUSTINE: If people
were scared enough,

893
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,802
then finally
they would stay away.

894
00:37:16,835 --> 00:37:17,836
Hold on.

895
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:20,372
So you're saying
your brazen act of violence,

896
00:37:20,406 --> 00:37:22,508
it wasn't personal at all?

897
00:37:22,541 --> 00:37:24,376
Manny was just a means
to an end.

898
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:29,381
You're under arrest, Justine,
for the murder of Manny Taylor.

899
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:39,791
After all that, I could
really use a glass of champagne.

900
00:37:41,827 --> 00:37:43,261
Chee--

901
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:53,805
(sighs)

902
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,575
He is who he is.

903
00:37:58,009 --> 00:37:59,711
LINDA:
This sneaking around,

904
00:37:59,745 --> 00:38:03,048
I can't do it anymore,
Amenadiel.

905
00:38:03,081 --> 00:38:04,683
(smooth jazz music playing)

906
00:38:04,716 --> 00:38:06,818
(chuckles softly)

907
00:38:06,852 --> 00:38:08,920
I'm so relieved
to hear you say that,

908
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:10,389
because I feel the same way.

909
00:38:10,422 --> 00:38:13,392
You do? (sighs)
I do.

910
00:38:13,425 --> 00:38:14,560
You see, I realize

911
00:38:14,593 --> 00:38:17,496
that I don't want to hide
our relationship anymore.

912
00:38:17,529 --> 00:38:21,633
Well, that's not
exactly what I mean.

913
00:38:23,569 --> 00:38:26,972
I'm not sure if we should be...

914
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:29,441
intimate together at all.

915
00:38:29,475 --> 00:38:31,877
Is this because
I have chlamydia?

916
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,412
Uh...

917
00:38:33,445 --> 00:38:37,516
No. I mean...
I mean, it doesn't help.

918
00:38:37,549 --> 00:38:39,585
I mean, I can't believe
you slept with a prostitute.

919
00:38:39,618 --> 00:38:42,721
First off, I didn't know
she was a prostitute.

920
00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:45,090
Secondly, you had sex
with my brother,

921
00:38:45,123 --> 00:38:46,725
the biggest whore
on the planet.

922
00:38:46,758 --> 00:38:48,694
How do I know you didn't
give me chlamydia?!

923
00:38:48,727 --> 00:38:51,430
Okay, how dare you?
How dare you?

924
00:38:51,463 --> 00:38:54,600
(phone vibrating)

925
00:38:54,633 --> 00:38:56,635
(laughs)

926
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:02,040
Uh, it's my doctor.

927
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:03,442
What do you know?

928
00:39:03,475 --> 00:39:05,677
False positive on the chlamydia.

929
00:39:07,112 --> 00:39:09,581
So, I guess
we fought for nothing.

930
00:39:10,816 --> 00:39:12,684
Well, it's not
for nothing, Amenadiel.

931
00:39:12,718 --> 00:39:13,952
I mean, yes,

932
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:18,957
I'm relieved
we don't have... chlamydia.

933
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:22,761
I don't think
we should be together.

934
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,897
I don't understand.

935
00:39:25,931 --> 00:39:29,701
I feel like I'm being
a bad friend to Maze.

936
00:39:29,735 --> 00:39:32,404
It doesn't matter
how much I like you.

937
00:39:32,438 --> 00:39:34,840
I can't date
my friend's ex anymore.

938
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:46,918
But I do... really like you.

939
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,725
And I really like you.

940
00:40:05,504 --> 00:40:07,606
*

941
00:40:22,688 --> 00:40:24,490
Lopez, you got a second?

942
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:28,894
No. Me first.

943
00:40:30,228 --> 00:40:32,764
I talk a lot, okay? I know that.

944
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:35,801
But most people seem
to like it, okay?

945
00:40:35,834 --> 00:40:38,737
And-and what's more important
is I like it.

946
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,640
Okay, so even
if you hate it,

947
00:40:41,673 --> 00:40:43,475
which you shouldn't,
but-but even if you do,

948
00:40:43,509 --> 00:40:47,012
it doesn't give you the right to
yell at me the way that you did.

949
00:40:47,045 --> 00:40:49,515
I-It was rude

950
00:40:49,548 --> 00:40:52,651
and unprofessional, and-and
I think you owe me an apology.

951
00:40:52,684 --> 00:40:54,085
You're right.

952
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,855
I was in a bad place,
and I took it out on you,

953
00:40:56,888 --> 00:40:58,890
and there's no excuse for that.

954
00:40:58,924 --> 00:40:59,958
I'm sorry.

955
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:03,795
You were in
a bad place? Really?

956
00:41:05,163 --> 00:41:07,533
Is there anything I can do?
D-Do you need a hug?

957
00:41:07,566 --> 00:41:09,535
(chuckles softly)

958
00:41:09,568 --> 00:41:10,836
Sure. Why not?

959
00:41:16,074 --> 00:41:18,644
You're gonna miss me.

960
00:41:23,749 --> 00:41:25,651
(tires screeching in distance)

961
00:41:25,684 --> 00:41:27,853
(car approaching rapidly)

962
00:41:30,055 --> 00:41:31,790
(tires screech)

963
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,862
Where do you think you're going?

964
00:41:39,064 --> 00:41:40,799
I didn't figure you
for the sentimental type.

965
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:43,669
Oh, believe me, I'm not.

966
00:41:43,702 --> 00:41:45,671
I'm here because
I finally figured out

967
00:41:45,704 --> 00:41:48,640
why my father returned my wings.

968
00:41:48,674 --> 00:41:50,976
And as it turns out,

969
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:54,613
it had nothing to do
with me at all.

970
00:41:54,646 --> 00:41:55,947
It was about you.

971
00:41:55,981 --> 00:41:57,683
How many times
do I have to tell you

972
00:41:57,716 --> 00:41:59,117
I had nothing to do
with your wings?

973
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:02,053
I know, but my father did.

974
00:42:02,087 --> 00:42:03,755
He wanted to stop

975
00:42:03,789 --> 00:42:07,125
you defying Him,
and He used me to do it.

976
00:42:07,158 --> 00:42:09,661
You said yourself

977
00:42:09,695 --> 00:42:10,996
you needed me out of the way.

978
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:13,599
And since my wings ruined
your kidnapping plan,

979
00:42:13,632 --> 00:42:17,903
it seems I was
a means to an end.

980
00:42:17,936 --> 00:42:19,571
So what?

981
00:42:19,605 --> 00:42:22,874
It means my dad screwed us both.

982
00:42:22,908 --> 00:42:26,044
But perhaps there's a way
for us to screw him back.

983
00:42:26,077 --> 00:42:27,278
How?

984
00:42:27,312 --> 00:42:30,048
By killing you, of course.

985
00:42:30,081 --> 00:42:32,751
I thought we went
over this already.

986
00:42:32,784 --> 00:42:35,253
You can't die, I know.

987
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:36,655
But I promise you,

988
00:42:36,688 --> 00:42:38,824
if you stay,

989
00:42:38,857 --> 00:42:41,627
I will find a way to end
your infinite misery,

990
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,795
if it's the last thing I do.

991
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:46,998
What makes you think
you can do that?

992
00:42:47,032 --> 00:42:49,768
Well, you may have
crossed paths with God,

993
00:42:49,801 --> 00:42:51,369
but you've certainly
never made a deal

994
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:54,239
with the Devil before,
now, have you?

995
00:42:54,272 --> 00:42:56,775
("Better the Devil You Know"
by Animal Fiction playing)

996
00:42:56,808 --> 00:42:58,877
What say we change that?

997
00:42:59,945 --> 00:43:03,782
* Better the devil you know...

998
00:43:03,815 --> 00:43:05,751
What do I have to lose?

999
00:43:06,652 --> 00:43:08,687
Well, hopefully,

1000
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,056
your life.

1001
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:12,891
* Walking in

1002
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:14,893
* Walking in the shadow.
