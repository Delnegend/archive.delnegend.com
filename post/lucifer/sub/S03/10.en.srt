1
00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:03,404
Previously on Lucifer...

2
00:00:03,437 --> 00:00:05,606
The reason I started
granting favors again

3
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:07,741
was because of the Sinnerman.
CHLOE: Do you think this is

4
00:00:07,775 --> 00:00:09,677
the same guy that kidnapped you
and dumped you in the desert?

5
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:10,811
I may need proof
that this guy is real.
He is real.

6
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,380
And very dangerous.

7
00:00:12,413 --> 00:00:14,282
I quit my job.
Today is my first day

8
00:00:14,315 --> 00:00:15,783
in the district attorney's
office. Surprise.

9
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:17,485
So why is your
gift desire?

10
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:20,088
Desire is the ultimate
expression of free will.

11
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:22,623
I help people do whatever
or whomever they want.

12
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:25,159
Hello.
SINNERMAN: I thought
you were looking for me.

13
00:00:25,193 --> 00:00:27,095
Come on. Let's talk.
(door bangs shut)

14
00:00:27,128 --> 00:00:28,496
In here!

15
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,364
You want to do
your little desire shtick?

16
00:00:30,398 --> 00:00:32,700
When I find out
what someone truly desires,

17
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:35,369
I find out
their greatest weakness.

18
00:00:35,403 --> 00:00:37,238
Why is this case
so important to you?

19
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:38,706
The Sinnerman killed my brother.

20
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:40,441
I need to make him pay.
That's him.

21
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:41,842
(grunting)

22
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,644
You're under arrest.

23
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:46,280
Look into my eyes!

24
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:49,250
(panting)

25
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:51,719
Now you will never
know what I want.

26
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:53,587
(laughing)

27
00:00:58,292 --> 00:01:00,394
OPERATOR:
911. What is your emergency?
(runner panting)

28
00:01:00,428 --> 00:01:03,063
Please, I need help!
He's gonna kill me! Please!

29
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,668
(thudding)

30
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:08,669
(screaming)

31
00:01:08,702 --> 00:01:11,272
(upbeat dance music plays)

32
00:01:11,305 --> 00:01:13,307
LUCIFER (trills):
Ah-ha!

33
00:01:13,341 --> 00:01:16,410
Nothing screams weekend like
tequila and scantily-clad women.

34
00:01:16,444 --> 00:01:18,279
And tequila. Cheers.

35
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:20,281
It's Wednesday.
Mmm.

36
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:23,151
Exactly. The party's just begun.

37
00:01:23,184 --> 00:01:24,618
Why are we celebrating again?

38
00:01:24,652 --> 00:01:26,420
Well, isn't it obvious?

39
00:01:26,454 --> 00:01:28,889
We apprehended the cad who
arranged for my kidnapping,

40
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,424
gave me wings,

41
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:31,692
took away my devil face.

42
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:34,695
Finally, Maze,
answers will be mine.

43
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:37,298
Right.

44
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:40,168
(woman grunts)
If you could say that with less
sarcasm, I'd appreciate it.

45
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:41,702
No, no, I'm sure you're right.

46
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:45,573
I'm sure a human jail
will stop a soldier of God.

47
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,475
That's actually more sarcasm.

48
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:48,709
I'm just saying,

49
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:50,344
devil face, wings-- big deal.

50
00:01:50,378 --> 00:01:52,646
If he wanted to hit you
where it really hurts,

51
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,715
there are other things
he could do to you,

52
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:56,584
or take away.

53
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:59,187
Oh.
I'm talking about
your life in L.A., Lucifer.

54
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,223
(laughs)
The club, your job.

55
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:05,859
Chloe.
I know what you're
talking about!

56
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:07,328
But I won't allow it.

57
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:08,862
I can assure you,
the only threat

58
00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:10,931
the Sinnerman poses from now on
is that ridiculous name.

59
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,866
Mmm.

60
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,369
They're bringing him in for
questioning in the morning,

61
00:02:15,403 --> 00:02:17,271
so I'll get what I need
to break him then.

62
00:02:17,305 --> 00:02:19,673
Good luck mojoing a blind guy.

63
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:21,609
(laughs)
I don't need eyes

64
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:24,812
to find out the Sinnerman's
desire, ergo his weakness.

65
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:27,615
There are other ways
to learn what someone wants.

66
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:28,749
What ways?

67
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:31,485
Just... ways.

68
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,221
(laughs, whoops)
Oh!

69
00:02:33,254 --> 00:02:34,355
Hello.

70
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:37,225
It's so hard.

71
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:40,794
Yes, always, but why don't I
help you with your stick first?

72
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,766
(people gasping)
Go on!

73
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:47,701
MAN: Oh, condoms!
WOMAN:
I'm gonna enjoy every condom!

74
00:02:47,735 --> 00:02:49,303
MAN:
They're the ribbed kind!

75
00:02:57,545 --> 00:02:58,846
T minus ten, people.

76
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,514
MAN:
Yes, sir.

77
00:03:00,548 --> 00:03:02,416
The prisoner is in the house.

78
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:05,919
Eye on the prize, no screwups,
and no one talks to him alone.

79
00:03:05,953 --> 00:03:07,955
(indistinct chatter)

80
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:11,259
Man, I just love
watching Pierce work.

81
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:14,295
It's like a master
class in ass-whoop

82
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:17,531
with a minor in whatevs.

83
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:19,467
Yeah.

84
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,270
I'm just surprised
at how well he's holding up.

85
00:03:22,303 --> 00:03:23,971
Well, it is his job.

86
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:25,539
No. I mean, it's just,

87
00:03:25,573 --> 00:03:27,541
there's no way
I could be that stoic

88
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:29,810
if the Sinnerman
had killed my brother.

89
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:32,246
Wait, what?

90
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:37,385
I knew the case was personal,
but his own flesh and blood?

91
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:41,555
Holy bananas, he must
totally need a hug.

92
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:42,890
Ella, wait.

93
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:44,558
But Pierce needs our
support right now.

94
00:03:44,592 --> 00:03:45,893
I didn't know
it wasn't common knowledge.

95
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:48,762
All right, this isn't even
my secret to share.

96
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:51,499
Right, of course,
'cause he's so private

97
00:03:51,532 --> 00:03:55,235
and brooding and... hot.

98
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,972
Not that that is
at all relevant.

99
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:00,708
Look, he's on edge.

100
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,009
Just don't bring it up, okay?

101
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:02,810
Okay.

102
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:08,782
MAN:
Right. Through this way.
Come on.

103
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:11,018
Keep going this way.

104
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:13,787
Nice to see you all again.

105
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:17,458
What. Too soon?
Come on.

106
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:19,393
Yeah, yeah.
(Sinnerman laughs)

107
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,737
(sighs)

108
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,672
He's certainly
oozing remorse.

109
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:33,474
Pierce.

110
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:35,008
We know
he kidnapped Lucifer,

111
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:36,910
we have physical evidence
tying him to the hair salon,

112
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,412
the kid with broken legs.

113
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:40,080
I saw him with a gun,

114
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,616
standing over the guy
he shot. Don't worry.

115
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,785
At this point, a confession's
just icing on the cake.

116
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:46,019
It's over.

117
00:04:46,053 --> 00:04:47,355
Is it?

118
00:04:47,388 --> 00:04:49,022
(door opens)
Ah, good.

119
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:51,559
Just in time for the main event.

120
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:53,627
Right. Why don't you two
make yourselves comfortable,

121
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:55,963
and I'll take first crack
at Helen Killer here. (laughs)

122
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:57,631
What? I thought he deserved

123
00:04:57,665 --> 00:04:59,500
a new nickname
now that he's blind.

124
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:01,635
I mean, you have to admit, the
Sinnerman has become a tad old.

125
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:02,903
Not happening.

126
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:04,372
Last time you
talked to him,

127
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:05,906
he gouged
his own eyes out.

128
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:09,109
Yes, a minor inconvenience,
especially for him.

129
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,778
I mean,
can you imagine living in L.A.

130
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,380
and not being able
to enjoy the sunset?

131
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:13,914
Yeah, there's not much of a view
from prison.

132
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:15,583
That's not the point.

133
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:17,518
No one's talking to him but me.
LUCIFER:
What?

134
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:18,919
You can't seriously
be suggesting

135
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:21,121
that you're the impartial party
here.

136
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,923
I mean, he's clearly
your Moby Dick,

137
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:24,625
and we all know
what happened to Captain Ahab.

138
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,027
Felled by savage revenge,

139
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,062
dragged to the bottom
of the sea?

140
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:30,931
Gosh, did they teach you nothing
at cop school?

141
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:32,933
I've read Moby Dick six times.

142
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:34,935
Oh, really. What
happened on page 83?

143
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:37,838
CHLOE:
So, what should I call you?

144
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:39,540
Sinner, is it?
Ah.

145
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:42,410
Mr. Man?

146
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:44,945
A census taker once tried
to test me.

147
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:49,850
Excuse me?
I ate his liver with some
fava beans and a nice Chianti.

148
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:52,553
(laughs)

149
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:55,088
Ah. No. I'm-I'm sorry.

150
00:05:55,122 --> 00:05:57,090
Always wanted to do that.

151
00:05:57,124 --> 00:05:59,092
I mean... (scoffs)

152
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:00,961
Do love that film, though.

153
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:03,697
Interesting time to make jokes
when two people are dead.

154
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:04,898
Mm.

155
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:06,667
Whatever
your name is,

156
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,437
this insanity plea--
it's not gonna fly.

157
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,740
You may be sick,
but I know you're not crazy.

158
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:14,475
Nope.

159
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:16,844
There's a definite method
to my non-madness.

160
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,579
Care to elaborate?
No.

161
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:20,514
No, you'll figure it out.

162
00:06:20,548 --> 00:06:21,982
Eventually.

163
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:23,851
Doesn't matter.

164
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,986
We've got enough to put you
away for a long, long time.

165
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:27,120
Oh, speaking of,

166
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:28,121
what time is it?

167
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:30,458
I can't see my watch.

168
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:32,125
(phone ringing)

169
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:34,795
Ella.
The Sinnerman's phone
from evidence.

170
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:36,564
I'd pick up if I were you.

171
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:39,099
(phone ringing)

172
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:40,668
Oops.

173
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:42,470
Too late.

174
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:44,438
Or you better hope it's not.

175
00:06:44,472 --> 00:06:46,874
(phone chimes)

176
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,577
No! Please! Please!
Will you please help me?!

177
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,579
What is that?

178
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:54,915
Wild guess: a woman
trapped in a reservoir

179
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:56,450
that will fill with water,

180
00:06:56,484 --> 00:06:57,918
oh,

181
00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:59,753
pretty soon, I'd say.

182
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:01,822
(shouting indistinctly)

183
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:03,624
Another victim?
How is that possible?

184
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:05,025
Always keep 'em guessing.

185
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:07,528
Where is she?!
Who else are you working with?

186
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:11,198
Well, I could tell you,
but what fun would that be?

187
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:12,766
Please help!

188
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,835
The only way she'll survive

189
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:16,570
is if I take you to her.

190
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,641
Right.

191
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:23,176
Who's up for a field trip?

192
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,145
*

193
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:33,687
OPERATOR:
911. What is your emergency?

194
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:34,955
WOMAN:
Please. Please, I need help!

195
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:36,890
Please. He's gonna kill me!
Please!

196
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:39,660
This is her
initial 911 call.

197
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:42,062
(woman screaming)

198
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:44,898
The Sinnerman was in custody
when this woman was abducted,

199
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:47,034
which means he's working
with someone on the outside,

200
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:48,201
an accomplice.

201
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:49,703
CHLOE:
Right.

202
00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:51,271
Find the accomplice,
find the girl.

203
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,040
Ella, what do we know about her?

204
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:56,076
Uh, yeah. Maggie Cole,
26, lives in Echo Park.

205
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:59,680
Tech tried pinging her cell,
but the battery's gone dead.

206
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:01,815
What about tracing the call
from the Sinnerman's phone?

207
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:04,184
Blocked and rerouted
through a server in Delhi,

208
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:06,520
so, like, zilch way
to track her, which is...

209
00:08:06,554 --> 00:08:08,055
Wonderful news!

210
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09,923
Means we can
save the life

211
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:12,259
of poor, doomed Maggie
the far more expedient way.

212
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:14,795
We are not letting the Sinnerman
out of here.

213
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,730
He clearly desires freedom,
which means

214
00:08:16,764 --> 00:08:18,699
he's motivated and likely
telling the truth.

215
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:20,634
Following his lead
will be much faster

216
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:23,270
than running down clues,
dodging red herrings

217
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:25,573
and following up on
random tips from every

218
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:26,907
Tom, Dick and Dullard.

219
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,542
Hey, guys.

220
00:08:28,576 --> 00:08:30,978
Uh, unis-- they checked out
the parking lot

221
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,312
at Maggie's apartment.

222
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,647
No sign of her or her car.

223
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:35,583
Ah. See? I'm telling you.

224
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:38,251
Obi Wan Can't-See-Me
is Maggie's only hope.

225
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:39,853
This is an obvious escape plan.

226
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:41,121
Find another way.

227
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:42,790
(sighs)

228
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:44,658
Fine.

229
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:46,860
Fine. If you insist on doing it
the long way and investigate,

230
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:49,329
we may as well hurry up and
inevitably get back to my idea.

231
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,732
Okay. What is Trixie doing

232
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:53,934
coloring crime scene photos
at a desk

233
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:56,203
when we have a psychotic killer
in custody?

234
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:58,105
Well, she's done wonders with
that mangled corpse, though.

235
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:00,874
Very artistic.

236
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:02,242
Didn't you book Mrs. Baczynski?

237
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,144
Look, I meant to, Chloe,
but I totally spaced

238
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:05,846
on this random
day off school.

239
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,247
But don't worry.

240
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,050
I'm handling it,
'cause I'm Super Dad.

241
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,622
ELLA:
Chloe, come look at this.

242
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:16,590
Wait.

243
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:18,058
Zoom in.

244
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:24,765
Got a pretty good idea
where Maggie spends her time.

245
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:26,867
Thanks. Come on.

246
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:30,037
(cheering, whistle blows)

247
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,673
MALE ANNOUNCER: And there
they are on the first course--

248
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:36,610
the bombastic Blazing Banshees!

249
00:09:36,644 --> 00:09:41,281
And their decidedly devious
opponents, the Derby Divas!

250
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:44,785
They're all out there fighting,
ladies and gentlemen.

251
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:47,721
So, Derby Divas
versus the Blazing Banshees.

252
00:09:47,755 --> 00:09:50,123
It's derby's most
notorious rivalry.

253
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:52,192
Oh, ladies to go.
I'll take two.

254
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:53,661
Wow.
ANNOUNCER:
Whoa!

255
00:09:53,694 --> 00:09:55,128
Nice sausage.

256
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:56,930
What? So, those
aren't ladies?

257
00:09:56,964 --> 00:09:59,700
No. Sausage.
It's an offensive maneuver.

258
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:01,669
When Trixie started
roller-skating,

259
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:04,938
I took her to the derby, and
it was love at first sausage.
Ah.

260
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:06,774
Right, well, as much
as I'd love a bite,

261
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:08,742
how about we get
back to proving

262
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:10,644
that your method of finding
Maggie isn't as good as mine?

263
00:10:10,678 --> 00:10:12,312
ANNOUNCER:
Score is now two to two.

264
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:14,047
Hello there.

265
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:16,383
We're looking for some
misleading information

266
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:19,653
on a missing person--
Maggie Cole.

267
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:22,222
The Slayer is missing?

268
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:23,724
When's the last time
you saw her?

269
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:25,358
Uh, she ditched practice
yesterday,

270
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:27,360
and she hasn't returned
my calls since...

271
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:28,929
Since what?

272
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,231
Since she got
into one doozy of a booby brawl

273
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:33,000
with our blocker,
Helena Handbasket.

274
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:35,736
Helena Handbasket.
Very clever.

275
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:38,706
Took both our pivots
to break it up.

276
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:41,975
Oh, right. Let me guess. Helena?

277
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:43,443
ANNOUNCER:
And there's Helena Handbasket.

278
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,278
Y'all didn't hear it from me.

279
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,848
Right.
(whoops)

280
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:48,849
(indistinct shouting)

281
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:49,950
Helena, can we...

282
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,318
Busy!

283
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:53,286
(announcer speaking
indistinctly)

284
00:10:54,722 --> 00:10:56,089
...ask you a few...

285
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:57,124
No way!

286
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,461
...questions?

287
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,730
Eat me!

288
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:04,231
Yes, please.

289
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:07,768
LAPD! Stop skating now!

290
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:09,269
*

291
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:10,370
(announcer continuing
indistinctly)

292
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,873
* Can't stay at home *

293
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:15,008
* Can't stay in school *

294
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:18,278
What on...
Oh! Sorry! Sorry.

295
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:19,747
* Down the streets

296
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,415
* I'm the girl next door *

297
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:25,385
* I'm the fox
you've been waiting for *
Aah!

298
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:28,288
* Hello, Daddy, hello, Mom

299
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:30,390
I don't think so.
* I'm your ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch *

300
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,159
* Cherry bomb

301
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:35,295
ANNOUNCER: She's gonna
rack up some more points.

302
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:36,897
(grunts) Whoa!

303
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,098
Has to be a foul.

304
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:40,167
* Want some style

305
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,036
* Your dead-end dreams
don't make you smile *

306
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,139
The Banshees and the Divas
are fighting it out.

307
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:48,008
One beer, please.

308
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,209
Is this really the time?

309
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:50,410
Always.

310
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,880
* Hello, Daddy, hello, Mom

311
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:55,048
* I'm your ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch *

312
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:57,918
* Cherry bomb

313
00:11:57,951 --> 00:11:58,919
* Cherry bomb!

314
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:00,921
Cheers.

315
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:02,189
Well, get the cuffs out.

316
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,124
Two more, two more points.

317
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:06,359
The Banshees pull ahead.

318
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,764
Well, I've no idea
what the Sin Bin is,

319
00:12:10,798 --> 00:12:12,132
but I approve.
It's the penalty box.

320
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:13,400
Oh.

321
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:15,468
Right.
Want to explain
why you ran?

322
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:17,470
Because you were chasing me.

323
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:19,139
See?
No harm, no foul.

324
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:21,809
No, you ran because you
realized we're cops.

325
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:23,310
This is all Maggie's fault.

326
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:25,345
Typical, she ratted me out.

327
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:28,048
So, hold on, you're saying
you did abduct Maggie?

328
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:31,151
Abduct? What? No. I just
roughed her up a bit.

329
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:32,552
Roughed her up, why?

330
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,222
Because she stole my spot
as lead jammer.

331
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,357
Ah.
You know, after Faith Kill

332
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,959
had that car accident?

333
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:40,928
Maggie didn't
deserve that position.

334
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:42,062
She can't even snowplow.

335
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,297
Oh, wheels turning,

336
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:46,399
old theory crumbling,
and the only way

337
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,936
to discard this witness...
Where were you
last night, Helena?

338
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:50,103
...a plausible alibi.

339
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:51,872
I was on fresh meat patrol.

340
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:54,307
Ooh, good for you, Helena.

341
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:56,443
No, it means
training a new crew.

342
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:58,078
Oh.
Shocker--

343
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,113
they sucked.
I was here all night.

344
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:02,082
I didn't abduct no one.

345
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,051
What about Maggie's car--
did she park here at the rink?

346
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:06,386
Nah.
Free lot over on 6th.

347
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:08,555
Maggie isn't just
a job-hogging bitch,

348
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:11,091
she's a cheap
job-hogging bitch.

349
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,192
(chuckles):
Right.

350
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:16,063
Well, come on,
Detective, chop-chop.

351
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:18,798
More dead-end clues
aren't gonna find themselves.

352
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:30,410
Uh, hi, Mrs. Baczynski?

353
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:34,381
Wow. Um...

354
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:38,218
my-my deepest condolences.

355
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:40,220
Well, sweetheart,
you won't be staying

356
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:42,555
with Mrs. Baczynski today.

357
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:45,025
Or ever again.

358
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:46,259
Great parenting, Dan.
(chuckling)

359
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:48,028
Good to know
that I'm not the only

360
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:49,229
questionable parent these days.

361
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:52,399
Uh, Charlotte.
Hey. Hi. Yeah.

362
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:55,002
Yeah, not my finest moment.
(short chuckle)

363
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:56,169
BEATRICE:
You're pretty.

364
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:58,538
How do you know Daddy?

365
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,107
She's my, uh,

366
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,909
work colleague.

367
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:03,510
Sometimes, uh, friend.

368
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:04,945
S-Sometimes...

369
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:08,048
Um...

370
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:10,417
how's the new job at
the, uh, the DA's office?

371
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,053
Dull. What's a girl got to do
to get a nice, grisly murder

372
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:14,287
or a few underage drug mules?

373
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:17,190
I like you.
You're funny.

374
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:19,026
And you're... short.

375
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:20,560
(chuckles)
(chuckles)

376
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,062
(clears throat)
Hey,

377
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:24,297
what can I get you, sweetie?

378
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:27,034
Mocha whip with
a shot of "expresso."

379
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:29,469
Ye... Wh... No.
No, not gonna happen.

380
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:31,471
Mommy lets me.

381
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:33,473
That statement would never
hold up in court.

382
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:35,542
Decent poker face, though.

383
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:39,046
(short chuckle)
Bye.

384
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:41,214
Bye.

385
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:46,086
Daddy, I have an idea.

386
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:48,521
CHLOE:
If we can find Maggie's car,

387
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,623
it may lead us
to the Sinnerman's accomplice.

388
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:53,293
Or be a shameful waste of the
poor girl's precious time.

389
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:55,362
What about wasting my time?

390
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,297
What happened
to being on the same page?

391
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,366
You know, partners?
Being a team?

392
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,301
Detective, I can assure
you this is all about

393
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:04,137
me making sure you
and I remain a team.

394
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:05,505
(scoffs)
You know...

395
00:15:07,174 --> 00:15:08,308
Maggie's car.

396
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,179
Plates match.

397
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:13,480
Right.
Lucifer, we have
to call forensics

398
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:15,215
before we taint
the evidence.

399
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,184
What, and waste more
of poor Maggie's precious time?

400
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:18,151
Lucifer, no.

401
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:26,393
(grunts)

402
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,361
(car alarms wailing)

403
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,701
Oops.

404
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:42,142
CHLOE:
Whoever rigged that grenade

405
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:44,077
wanted that car to explode
the instant someone touched it.

406
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:46,113
No trace evidence
means we still have

407
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:48,015
no way of tracking Maggie.

408
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:50,417
I can't believe
I'm suggesting this, but...

409
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,718
Okay, fine, perhaps I shouldn't
have touched the car.

410
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:54,154
...we need to bust out
the Sinnerman.

411
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:57,290
Uh... not what I was
expecting, but...

412
00:15:57,324 --> 00:15:59,226
thank you, Detective, for
finally seeing things my way.

413
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:01,361
Well, you clearly
feel strongly about this.

414
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:03,296
For better or worse,
you are my partner,

415
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,697
so I need
to have your back on this.

416
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:06,466
Just one question, though.

417
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:09,036
How do you suggest we
get him out of here?

418
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:11,138
I actually have a plan.

419
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:14,507
But in order for it to work, you
need to do exactly what I say.

420
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,176
No more going off grid,

421
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:17,710
no more destroying
trace evidence,

422
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:19,112
no more Luciferness.

423
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:21,181
Is that clear?

424
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:23,183
As a chilled vodka martini.

425
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:24,417
Served neat, of course.

426
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:26,319
First we need the keys
to holding.

427
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:28,521
What, the same keys
old stiff-as-a-board Pierce

428
00:16:28,555 --> 00:16:30,257
has locked away in his office?

429
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,692
Guess we'll need a distraction.

430
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,427
About that Pierce thing
this morning...

431
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:36,063
(sighs)
I cannot

432
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:38,331
stop thinking about
that poor man.
Me, too.

433
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:40,200
He's really going through a lot.

434
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:41,334
Maybe a little Ella

435
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:44,404
is exactly
what the doctor ordered.

436
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:47,574
Crafty maneuver, Detective.
But do you really think

437
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:50,210
Ms. Lopez will fall
for such a blatant manipulation?

438
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:51,611
Uh...

439
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:53,580
Oh, my God, I'm so in.

440
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:55,282
But here's the thing.

441
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:57,084
I don't want it to seem
like I'm blabbing

442
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:59,686
Pierce's personal business
all over the precinct.

443
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:01,088
Totes understood.

444
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:02,722
All over it.

445
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:04,691
I did not hear it from you.

446
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:08,061
I'm going to let him...

447
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,262
tell me.

448
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:16,569
Is everything all right, Lopez?

449
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:18,171
We lost Buttons when I was nine.

450
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:19,839
That was our pet Corgi.
Buttons, I mean.

451
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,508
Sorry for your loss.

452
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:25,378
I mean, once I understood
how Buttons got out,

453
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:28,648
I was able to talk about it,
and the healing process

454
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:30,117
could really begin, you know?

455
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,153
I'll never,
ever forget that day.

456
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:44,197
How hard can it be
to find one tiny key?

457
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:45,798
Or for a tiny lab tech
to trap a hardened

458
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:49,136
six-foot-four lieutenant
against his will?

459
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:51,404
For the longest time,

460
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:54,774
I just wanted to find
whoever was driving that evil,

461
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:57,610
champagne-colored hatchback
with the custom spoilers.

462
00:17:57,644 --> 00:17:59,412
Uh-huh.

463
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:01,414
But then I realized...

464
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:03,283
it wasn't about
the hatchback.
(sighs)

465
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:04,817
It wasn't. And...

466
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:07,420
Where could they be?

467
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:22,569
Okay, assuming we do manage
to swipe the keys

468
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:25,172
to the holding cell,
how do we get him out of here?

469
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:27,374
I mean, our sightless scoundrel
doesn't exactly blend.

470
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:30,377
All you have to do is
go up to that bomb tech

471
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,878
and hand her this.

472
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,615
Consider it handled.

473
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:40,387
Seriously?
This is what you want?

474
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,890
The more important question is:
what do you want in return?

475
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:49,862
Even if my charm
does work on the bomb tech,

476
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:51,798
and who are we kidding,
course it will, we still

477
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:54,201
need someone
to sell the big finish.

478
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:56,269
Someone deserving

479
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:58,538
of a very special gift.

480
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:00,307
Aw.

481
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,608
What's this?

482
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:02,875
It's too nicely wrapped

483
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:06,213
to be another severed head.

484
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:07,680
Seriously?

485
00:19:07,714 --> 00:19:11,584
(ticking)

486
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:13,486
Call the bomb squad!

487
00:19:15,522 --> 00:19:17,190
Everyone evacuate now!

488
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:27,834
(grunts)

489
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:28,801
(sighs)

490
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:35,642
Eat your heart out,
George Clooney.

491
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,710
Not literally.

492
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:38,978
Understood.

493
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,448
I cannot believe
that actually worked.

494
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:43,283
PIERCE:
Well, it almost worked.

495
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:47,787
Did you really think I was gonna
let you bust him out...

496
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,222
without me?

497
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,961
(siren wailing)

498
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,332
Oh, put that down, please.

499
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:01,468
That was given to me
by the ambassador of Sweden.

500
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:02,535
It's very...

501
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:04,537
Ugly?
Valuable.

502
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:07,407
There's nothing fun to do here.

503
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,910
I can't touch anything
or jump on anything.

504
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:13,546
And you don't have
any toys to play with.

505
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,615
I thought you'd
be more exciting.

506
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:17,617
Well, you could
alphabetize

507
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,287
these case files.

508
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:21,954
(sighs)

509
00:20:21,988 --> 00:20:23,890
You don't have kids, do you?

510
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:25,825
Actually, I do.
Two.

511
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:26,959
They live with their father.

512
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:27,960
That makes sense.

513
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:31,364
Um, well, it's for the best

514
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:33,766
since I'm so busy at work,
and if you don't mind,

515
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,768
I'd like to get back to it,
if I'm ever gonna catch a case.

516
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:38,438
And that makes no sense.

517
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:40,840
Well, if the department sees
that I'm working hard...

518
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:42,642
No, about your kids.

519
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:44,977
My mom and dad work,

520
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:46,779
and they still hang out with me,

521
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:49,982
together and apart.

522
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:52,719
Good for them.
Monopoly,

523
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:55,455
roller derby,
climbing the wall at the Y.

524
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:57,790
You could do stuff
with your kids, too.

525
00:20:57,824 --> 00:21:00,660
Well, the truth is...

526
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:02,862
they don't want to see me.

527
00:21:02,895 --> 00:21:05,398
You're the mom.

528
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:07,500
You make the rules.

529
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:13,840
Are you and my dad having sex?

530
00:21:16,843 --> 00:21:18,978
Uh...

531
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,820
It really is true,
how the other senses kick in

532
00:21:27,854 --> 00:21:29,822
once one is removed.

533
00:21:29,856 --> 00:21:31,691
I can remove a few
others if you'd like.

534
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:34,361
Shut up and walk.
Both of you.

535
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:37,364
A hundred more yards,
then we have to turn east.

536
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:40,467
So, why did Mr. By the Book
change his mind?

537
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,768
Why are you helping us?

538
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,370
Because you were right.

539
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:44,904
It's the best way
to find the girl.

540
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:47,106
The Sinnerman
desires freedom.

541
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,608
He wants to escape.

542
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,009
I'm here to make
sure he doesn't.

543
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:51,844
Oh, so you really think
this is a trap,

544
00:21:51,878 --> 00:21:53,580
that this accomplice
is laying in wait?

545
00:21:53,613 --> 00:21:55,782
Why else would he lead us
to the middle of nowhere?

546
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,517
Right. Ambush.

547
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,786
Well, I guess we'll
just have to go nut to butt,

548
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,454
have Charlie do
the foxtrot,

549
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:02,989
cover each other's
sixes and all that.

550
00:22:03,022 --> 00:22:05,592
You know? Hooah!

551
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:08,928
Military terms.
Weren't you a serviceman?

552
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:10,830
Yeah. We don't talk like that.

553
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,001
MAGGIE (in distance):
I can't breathe!

554
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:16,135
I hear something.

555
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,438
(Maggie screaming)

556
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:22,809
Help! Aah!

557
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:23,943
(burbling)

558
00:22:23,976 --> 00:22:25,912
I can't breathe!

559
00:22:28,648 --> 00:22:30,583
Maggie, hang on!

560
00:22:35,822 --> 00:22:37,957
(grunts)
Come on.

561
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,092
(gasping, coughing)

562
00:22:40,126 --> 00:22:41,961
Come on.
I got you.

563
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,070
Come on.

564
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,442
(coughing)
You're safe now, Maggie.

565
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:57,744
You're gonna be okay.

566
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:00,447
Where's Lucifer?

567
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,014
Where's the Sinnerman?

568
00:23:08,688 --> 00:23:10,790
His accomplice
was here. Damn it!

569
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:12,124
(panting)

570
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:14,461
They've got Lucifer, too.

571
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:16,729
*

572
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,001
Come on.
Pick up. Pick up.

573
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:23,636
(over phone):
Hello. This is Lucifer.

574
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:24,971
You know what to do--

575
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:26,639
preferably in the nude.

576
00:23:26,673 --> 00:23:28,174
Damn it.

577
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:29,942
(exhales)

578
00:23:29,976 --> 00:23:32,945
How could I be so stupid?
I knew this was a setup.

579
00:23:32,979 --> 00:23:35,782
No. Breaking the Sinnerman
out was my idea.

580
00:23:35,815 --> 00:23:37,183
This is my fault.
It's my watch.

581
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:40,186
This is on me.

582
00:23:40,219 --> 00:23:41,721
We're already canvassing.

583
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:43,523
Let's put in an APB
for three men.

584
00:23:43,556 --> 00:23:45,858
We may not need an APB.
We have Maggie.

585
00:23:47,694 --> 00:23:50,730
I was leaving the rink,
and he chased me.

586
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:53,065
I made it to my car, but...

587
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:54,901
he was too strong.

588
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:56,202
He grabbed me,

589
00:23:56,235 --> 00:23:58,838
threw me in a van,
and then I woke up here.

590
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:00,206
Did you see his face?

591
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:02,942
He was wearing a mask.

592
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:05,211
Sounds like it happened fast.

593
00:24:05,244 --> 00:24:06,813
How would he
have had

594
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:08,948
enough time to rig the car
with explosives?

595
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:10,750
Um...

596
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:14,086
he must have gone back
and put the grenade in later.

597
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:18,457
We didn't mention... a grenade.

598
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,932
Okay, I...

599
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,702
Okay, I made it all up.

600
00:24:29,736 --> 00:24:31,838
I wasn't attacked-- I...

601
00:24:31,871 --> 00:24:33,773
I abducted myself.

602
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,508
Why?
All I wanted

603
00:24:35,542 --> 00:24:37,076
was to be my team's lead jammer.

604
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:38,745
But I could never compete

605
00:24:38,778 --> 00:24:41,581
with that spotlight-stealing
bitch, Faith Kill.

606
00:24:41,614 --> 00:24:45,217
So... I went to this guy
who grants people favors.

607
00:24:45,251 --> 00:24:46,719
We need a name.

608
00:24:46,753 --> 00:24:49,922
He just goes by the Sinnerman.

609
00:24:49,956 --> 00:24:51,791
I asked him
to get rid

610
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:53,793
of Faith,
and the next thing I know,

611
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:55,528
she's in a car accident.

612
00:24:55,562 --> 00:24:57,797
I never wanted anyone to die.
So he took out

613
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,733
your competition,
then demanded you repay him

614
00:25:00,767 --> 00:25:02,869
by faking your own kidnapping?

615
00:25:02,902 --> 00:25:05,638
And the 911 call...

616
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:08,107
the explosion.

617
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:11,544
He was going to kill me, too,
if I didn't do it.

618
00:25:15,582 --> 00:25:17,584
There was never
an accomplice.

619
00:25:17,617 --> 00:25:19,018
Then who kidnapped Lucifer?

620
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:20,987
No one. He wanted
to be alone with him,

621
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,089
so he kidnapped the Sinnerman.

622
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:25,157
*

623
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:28,094
* They say the Devil's
comin' out to take my soul *

624
00:25:30,897 --> 00:25:33,566
* And, boy, you know better
than you think you know *
(gasps)

625
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,868
Oh, good!
You're awake.

626
00:25:35,902 --> 00:25:39,105
Just in time
for the fun to begin.

627
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:40,973
But, uh...

628
00:25:41,007 --> 00:25:43,576
before we start,
one tiny adjustment.

629
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:46,045
(sighs)

630
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:48,014
* But if the Devil's
comin' out to take my soul... *

631
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:49,315
There we go.

632
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:51,117
(chuckles)
Much less creepy.

633
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,184
(grunting)

634
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:55,187
Where...

635
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:56,956
where am I?

636
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:59,191
Well, I thought we'd extend
our little field trip.

637
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:03,029
I save my Hills estate for...
only very special occasions.

638
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:05,632
My very own "sin bin,"
if you will.

639
00:26:05,665 --> 00:26:07,366
Gosh, it's poetic, isn't it?

640
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:10,803
The man who desired freedom
fell into his very own trap.

641
00:26:10,837 --> 00:26:12,839
Is that what you want?

642
00:26:12,872 --> 00:26:14,340
To be my warden?

643
00:26:14,373 --> 00:26:15,875
Oh, no.

644
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:19,045
No, the only thing
I desire is answers.

645
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,313
So...

646
00:26:21,347 --> 00:26:24,283
it's time to make
a deal with the Devil.

647
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:26,886
You give me what I want,

648
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:29,689
and I might give you
what you want.

649
00:26:29,722 --> 00:26:32,224
I'm not gonna
tell you anything.

650
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:33,626
Oh, yes...

651
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,961
you are.

652
00:26:34,994 --> 00:26:36,696
You had me kidnapped,

653
00:26:36,729 --> 00:26:38,164
dumped in the desert,

654
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:40,633
somehow made my feathery
burdens grow back,

655
00:26:40,667 --> 00:26:43,269
and then took away
my devil face.

656
00:26:43,302 --> 00:26:44,804
Why?

657
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,808
(wry chuckle)

658
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:50,943
You will talk.

659
00:26:50,977 --> 00:26:54,346
And you will give me
what I want: wings off,

660
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,148
devil face back!

661
00:26:56,182 --> 00:26:59,686
Because no one decides
who I am but me!

662
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:01,420
Ooh...

663
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,356
I'm sensing this is the part
where the said devil face

664
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,192
would kick in, right?

665
00:27:06,993 --> 00:27:08,695
(yells)

666
00:27:08,728 --> 00:27:10,029
(panting):
Okay. Okay.

667
00:27:10,062 --> 00:27:11,430
I'll tell you what
you need to do.

668
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,701
But it's not gonna
be easy. First...

669
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:16,435
you have to draw
a pentagram,

670
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,238
sprinkle some
powdered eye of newt,

671
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:21,974
and then wait
for a full moon.

672
00:27:22,008 --> 00:27:23,943
How's your howl?

673
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:25,177
(laughing)

674
00:27:25,211 --> 00:27:27,113
(breathy chuckle)

675
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:28,347
(laughing)

676
00:27:30,817 --> 00:27:32,318
Freaking impossible

677
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:34,721
to make it through that
with a straight face.

678
00:27:34,754 --> 00:27:37,456
Tragic error, my sinful thug.

679
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,859
Oh. What are you gonna do?

680
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:42,328
Punish a feeble, blind man?

681
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:45,031
Oh, no, no.
I wouldn't dream of it.

682
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,869
*

683
00:27:49,902 --> 00:27:51,871
Oh, right, you can't see.

684
00:27:51,904 --> 00:27:54,273
(chuckles)
Allow me to paint you a picture.

685
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:57,476
Meet Hell's
most brutal torturer.

686
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,780
The pleasure's all mine.

687
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:09,889
Are we sure he's not celestial?

688
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:11,057
Are you questioning
my expertise?

689
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:12,458
He's definitely human.

690
00:28:12,491 --> 00:28:15,061
And you tried waterboarding?
Twice.

691
00:28:15,094 --> 00:28:16,328
Bamboo under the nails?

692
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:18,130
Do I look like
an amateur?

693
00:28:18,164 --> 00:28:19,866
Nickelback on repeat?

694
00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:22,068
That's where I started.
Well, what kind
of demon

695
00:28:22,101 --> 00:28:24,937
can't procure answers
from one puny human?!

696
00:28:24,971 --> 00:28:27,006
You want to give it a try?
Be my guest.

697
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,008
Gladly. Hand it over.

698
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:32,912
No. I've pushed
that guy to his limit.

699
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:34,480
Anything else might kill him.

700
00:28:34,513 --> 00:28:36,215
You and I both know...

701
00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:38,985
Angels aren't allowed
to kill humans, yes.

702
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,355
Or are they?

703
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:46,826
Lucifer...

704
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:48,895
don't be an idiot.
No, no, no, no.

705
00:28:48,928 --> 00:28:51,363
This is the answer
to all my problems, Maze.

706
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:55,201
Killing the Sinnerman
is exactly what I need to do.

707
00:28:56,903 --> 00:28:58,537
We need to find out
where Lucifer took him.

708
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,807
Unis checked Lux
and the penthouse,

709
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,842
but no sign of Lucifer
or the Sinnerman.

710
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:04,510
And, of course,
his cell's still off.

711
00:29:04,543 --> 00:29:06,846
Any hits on the van
they took off in?
Nada.

712
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:08,180
He must have had a car stashed

713
00:29:08,214 --> 00:29:09,949
and then ditched the van
on the way.

714
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:11,383
This may help.

715
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:12,819
What is this?

716
00:29:12,852 --> 00:29:13,986
High-end real estate?

717
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,487
It's every place
Lucifer owns

718
00:29:15,521 --> 00:29:16,889
in Southern California.
Part of Espinoza's

719
00:29:16,923 --> 00:29:18,124
Lucifer files.

720
00:29:18,157 --> 00:29:21,393
Um, why do you have
files on Lucifer?

721
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:22,829
DAN:
Chloe and I
were married.

722
00:29:22,862 --> 00:29:24,797
So what if I did
some due diligence

723
00:29:24,831 --> 00:29:26,532
on my wife's new
partner? Call it...

724
00:29:26,565 --> 00:29:28,200
being protective.

725
00:29:28,234 --> 00:29:30,136
Not the word I had in mind.
(coughs): Stalker.

726
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:31,470
But... whatevs.

727
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:33,272
Lucifer plants a bomb
at my desk,

728
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:34,540
and I'm the creepy one?

729
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:36,943
Um... actually...

730
00:29:36,976 --> 00:29:38,811
that was me. Sorry.

731
00:29:38,845 --> 00:29:40,246
The bomb was fake.

732
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,881
Wow. Okay.

733
00:29:41,914 --> 00:29:44,050
Human heads.
Explosives.

734
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:45,551
Can someone send me,
I don't know,

735
00:29:45,584 --> 00:29:47,386
a muffin basket next time?
That'd be nice.

736
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:49,421
There's over
a dozen properties here.

737
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:51,824
Oh, and some are,
like, an hour away.

738
00:29:51,858 --> 00:29:54,026
I guess we have
to check each one?
Maybe not.

739
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,295
I think I know
where they are.

740
00:29:56,328 --> 00:29:58,264
*

741
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:06,538
I'm a demon.

742
00:30:06,572 --> 00:30:09,408
Big fan of death
and destruction.

743
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:11,277
But killing a human

744
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,512
is Angel No-No's 101.

745
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:15,915
Look at your brother--
total power loss,

746
00:30:15,948 --> 00:30:17,984
and he only got murder adjacent.

747
00:30:18,017 --> 00:30:19,351
Precisely my point.

748
00:30:19,385 --> 00:30:22,121
If I kill a human,
then I lose my wings!

749
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:24,323
And, because I've been
such a naughty angel,

750
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:26,492
I get my devil face back,
and-- bonus!--

751
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:29,128
I rid humanity
of our sightless psychopath.

752
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:31,130
Three birds, one Sinnerman.

753
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:34,600
Mm-hmm. In theory, except your
Father is going to be pissed.

754
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:36,335
You kill a human,

755
00:30:36,368 --> 00:30:38,104
one that He sent to do
His bidding...

756
00:30:38,137 --> 00:30:39,505
Exactly!

757
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:40,973
(huffing breath)

758
00:30:41,007 --> 00:30:43,075
Look, you said it
yourself, Maze.

759
00:30:43,109 --> 00:30:46,913
If I don't stop this now, who
knows what else he'll do, or...

760
00:30:48,414 --> 00:30:50,482
(shuddering):
...who he might take from me?

761
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:53,019
*

762
00:30:58,657 --> 00:31:00,192
Okay.

763
00:31:01,627 --> 00:31:03,129
(exhales)

764
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,899
(departing footsteps)
Wait!

765
00:31:06,933 --> 00:31:08,634
Where are you going?

766
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:10,202
Happy hour at the Chateau.

767
00:31:10,236 --> 00:31:11,603
Text me when
you've done the deed.

768
00:31:11,637 --> 00:31:12,939
What...

769
00:31:12,972 --> 00:31:14,473
(chuckles):
Actually...

770
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:16,976
I'll be able to tell
by the plague of locusts.

771
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:18,010
(exhales)

772
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:25,384
You're sure that
they're in the Hills?

773
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:26,585
I mean, pretty sure.

774
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,487
He said, "Imagine
living in L.A.

775
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,589
and not being able
to enjoy the sunset."

776
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:33,125
I mean, just like Lucifer
to bring a blind man

777
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:35,327
to the place with the best view.

778
00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:37,429
And you know him
that well?
(sighs)

779
00:31:37,463 --> 00:31:39,131
Thought I did.

780
00:31:39,165 --> 00:31:41,400
Just... hope we can get there

781
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:44,937
before he does something
he can't take back.

782
00:31:44,971 --> 00:31:46,905
*

783
00:31:48,374 --> 00:31:51,043
That is an embarrassment
of riches, really.

784
00:31:51,077 --> 00:31:54,713
So many delicious ways
to kill a human.

785
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,415
Let me see.

786
00:31:56,448 --> 00:31:58,550
Starving rats.
No.

787
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:00,052
Too time-consuming.

788
00:32:00,086 --> 00:32:01,187
Gunshot?

789
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,288
Banal.

790
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:04,156
Oh, I know-- oldie but a goody.

791
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,691
(grunts)
Beheading.

792
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:07,926
(seething breaths)

793
00:32:10,997 --> 00:32:12,031
(low grunt)

794
00:32:12,064 --> 00:32:15,034
(exhales)
Honestly!

795
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:18,004
Can you at least try
to look threatening?

796
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,672
(grunts, pants)

797
00:32:20,706 --> 00:32:22,274
All right.

798
00:32:22,308 --> 00:32:24,376
(groans)

799
00:32:29,081 --> 00:32:30,516
(mumbles)

800
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:33,185
(panting)

801
00:32:33,219 --> 00:32:35,421
Well, slight improvement.

802
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:37,556
And I can't kill you
sitting down.

803
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:40,059
You need to stand up
and face me like a man.

804
00:32:40,092 --> 00:32:42,028
(grunts)

805
00:32:42,061 --> 00:32:43,329
Well, come on!

806
00:32:43,362 --> 00:32:44,463
(groans)

807
00:32:44,496 --> 00:32:47,066
(grunting)

808
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:48,467
I'm to your left.

809
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,069
(grunting)

810
00:32:50,102 --> 00:32:52,138
Your other left...

811
00:32:52,171 --> 00:32:54,340
I'm right here!

812
00:32:54,373 --> 00:32:56,208
Hello?! Marco!

813
00:32:56,242 --> 00:32:57,709
I...
(sighs)

814
00:32:57,743 --> 00:33:01,680
Well, there's no glory
in wrestling a starving bear.

815
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:05,417
Perhaps a last meal of some kind
to perk you up.

816
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:07,419
Hello.

817
00:33:07,453 --> 00:33:09,155
Caviar.

818
00:33:09,188 --> 00:33:12,624
You're going to... feed me?

819
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:15,227
Well, just because I'm about
to slaughter a man in cold blood

820
00:33:15,261 --> 00:33:17,429
doesn't mean I'm not civilized.

821
00:33:17,463 --> 00:33:21,300
No. Just means
you're stalling.

822
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,302
(laughing)

823
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:25,037
Don't be preposterous.

824
00:33:25,071 --> 00:33:26,505
I've waited a long time
for revenge.

825
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:28,240
I'm simply savoring the moment.

826
00:33:28,274 --> 00:33:31,610
I want you to feel your failure.

827
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:33,645
The knowledge that,
long after you're gone,

828
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:37,616
I shall continue to live here
however

829
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:40,686
and with whomever I choose.

830
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:42,388
Or...

831
00:33:42,421 --> 00:33:46,525
you don't have what it takes
to kill a man.

832
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:48,127
Not many people do.

833
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,130
Perhaps you're a coward.

834
00:33:51,163 --> 00:33:53,332
(chuckles)

835
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:56,635
(tires screeching)

836
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:58,804
He's here.

837
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:03,309
Evil, smug, homely.

838
00:34:03,342 --> 00:34:07,746
Bingo! You win the grand prize
at the Painful Death Raffle.

839
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:10,482
So, unless you want a bonus
round for being a loudmouth,

840
00:34:10,516 --> 00:34:12,151
I suggest that...
Me?

841
00:34:12,184 --> 00:34:13,719
You're the one doing
all the talking.

842
00:34:16,655 --> 00:34:19,425
Actually, you know what,
I'll boil you alive.

843
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:21,093
(knife clatters)
Yeah. Top most painful way

844
00:34:21,127 --> 00:34:22,628
to die, according to BuzzFeed.

845
00:34:22,661 --> 00:34:24,430
Right. I'll need a pot.

846
00:34:24,463 --> 00:34:25,697
A big one.

847
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:27,433
How about drown me
with a flood?

848
00:34:27,466 --> 00:34:29,568
Or strike me with lightning?

849
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:32,204
What cheesy metaphor

850
00:34:32,238 --> 00:34:34,673
would you prefer?

851
00:34:34,706 --> 00:34:37,276
Apple, tree?

852
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:39,511
A chip off the old block?

853
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,183
Like Father,

854
00:34:44,216 --> 00:34:46,152
like Son?
Enough!

855
00:34:46,185 --> 00:34:47,386
(grunts)

856
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:50,856
Pull the string,
puppet master.

857
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:53,392
(sighs)
Damn it. Where are they?

858
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:55,794
Take the upstairs.

859
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:57,663
You're right.

860
00:34:57,696 --> 00:34:59,265
(scoffs)

861
00:34:59,298 --> 00:35:01,800
I don't have it in me
to kill a human.

862
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:04,102
Uh, no. No, wait.

863
00:35:05,504 --> 00:35:07,206
You have to do it.

864
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:08,607
Hold on.

865
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,409
I wondered why you,

866
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,844
the evil genius, hadn't sprung
a more clever trap.

867
00:35:12,878 --> 00:35:14,546
It has to be you.

868
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:18,317
Because I was the trap.

869
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:20,152
You never wanted freedom.

870
00:35:20,186 --> 00:35:23,489
Your true desire was to die.

871
00:35:23,522 --> 00:35:25,357
And for some reason,
you need me to do it.

872
00:35:25,391 --> 00:35:26,758
Yes.

873
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:29,495
Yes. You supposedly believe
in free will.

874
00:35:29,528 --> 00:35:31,230
Then honor mine.

875
00:35:31,263 --> 00:35:32,798
Why do you need me to do it?
Free will.

876
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:34,200
Why?!

877
00:35:34,233 --> 00:35:35,367
Why?!

878
00:35:35,401 --> 00:35:36,902
(grunts)

879
00:35:36,935 --> 00:35:39,838
(gasps)
No.

880
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:43,475
No!
(panting)

881
00:35:43,509 --> 00:35:45,611
No.

882
00:35:48,514 --> 00:35:51,350
He's gone.

883
00:35:59,258 --> 00:36:01,159
(siren whooping)
(indistinct chatter)

884
00:36:02,861 --> 00:36:04,563
Pierce, I'm sorry.

885
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:07,933
I know you didn't want it
to end this way.

886
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:10,702
It's the only way
it could end.

887
00:36:10,736 --> 00:36:12,671
You have clearance...

888
00:36:25,817 --> 00:36:27,653
You wanted to see me?

889
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:30,522
Yes.

890
00:36:30,556 --> 00:36:33,292
Something very strange
just happened here.

891
00:36:33,325 --> 00:36:35,527
Um, a "thank you for saving
my life" might be appropriate.

892
00:36:35,561 --> 00:36:37,529
I actually wasn't
the one in danger.

893
00:36:37,563 --> 00:36:39,665
I figured out that you're the
one who grabbed the Sinnerman.

894
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,800
Clearly, things
went south.

895
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:44,002
No. Let me explain
what happened.

896
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,572
What happened
was you didn't follow my lead.

897
00:36:46,605 --> 00:36:49,441
And, as usual, you did
whatever the hell you wanted.

898
00:36:49,475 --> 00:36:51,443
Detective, I understand
that my interest in getting

899
00:36:51,477 --> 00:36:53,979
our blind barbarian alone
may have been a tad selfish,

900
00:36:54,012 --> 00:36:56,982
but it turns out I was the pawn.

901
00:36:57,015 --> 00:36:58,950
I don't have time for this.

902
00:36:58,984 --> 00:37:01,953
It was the Sinnerman's plan to
be snatched by me all along.

903
00:37:01,987 --> 00:37:03,822
He wanted to die.

904
00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:05,457
Pierce smoothed things over,

905
00:37:05,491 --> 00:37:06,892
if that's what
you're worried about.

906
00:37:06,925 --> 00:37:08,727
The official statement says
that you were grabbed

907
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,028
in an escape attempt.

908
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,997
You think I care
what Pierce thinks?

909
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,965
No. I don't think you care
what anyone thinks.

910
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:15,567
That's not true.

911
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:17,369
I told you, I did this for us.

912
00:37:17,403 --> 00:37:18,837
For us? For the team?

913
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,839
I had your back on this,
Lucifer,

914
00:37:20,872 --> 00:37:22,408
and, for whatever reason,

915
00:37:22,441 --> 00:37:24,576
you still felt the need
to go behind mine.

916
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:33,652
*

917
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:41,927
(giggles)
Daddy!

918
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,928
Hey.

919
00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:44,863
So, the afternoon went well?

920
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:46,965
(chuckles)

921
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:50,569
Hey, uh, as a thank you
for watching Trixie,

922
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:52,838
maybe we can go grab
that coffee sometime?

923
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:54,706
Uh, we got coffee this morning.

924
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,608
Yeah.

925
00:37:56,642 --> 00:37:59,311
I'm kidding, Dan.

926
00:37:59,345 --> 00:38:00,312
(chuckles)

927
00:38:00,346 --> 00:38:01,380
Whew.
(chuckles)

928
00:38:02,481 --> 00:38:04,816
Dinner would be
more romantic.

929
00:38:08,654 --> 00:38:09,988
Dinner it is.
It's okay by me.

930
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:12,023
(chuckles)

931
00:38:12,057 --> 00:38:15,794
Bye.
Bye.

932
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:19,531
(quietly):
You are the best wingman ever.

933
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:35,881
Yes, it's me again.

934
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:38,717
I don't care what they
or you say.

935
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,952
I want to see my kids.

936
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:45,457
I'm their mother.

937
00:38:49,695 --> 00:38:51,062
What are you
looking for?

938
00:38:51,096 --> 00:38:53,499
(sighs)
Answers.

939
00:38:53,532 --> 00:38:55,534
I mean,
there has to be something

940
00:38:55,567 --> 00:38:56,602
in Sinnerman's
personal belongings.

941
00:38:56,635 --> 00:38:58,036
I'll be right back.

942
00:38:58,069 --> 00:38:59,771
(sighs)

943
00:38:59,805 --> 00:39:01,940
I just want to say,

944
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:04,810
oh, my God, you killed it.

945
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,077
I mean, killed him.

946
00:39:06,111 --> 00:39:08,414
I mean, I obvi
wasn't there-there,

947
00:39:08,447 --> 00:39:10,549
but I just read
the crime scene report,

948
00:39:10,582 --> 00:39:11,983
and-- holy burrito bowl--

949
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:13,885
with your "take down
the bad dude" heroics

950
00:39:13,919 --> 00:39:16,788
and...
Lopez, just stop talking!

951
00:39:22,561 --> 00:39:24,062
What on earth?

952
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,490
Well, I'm here.

953
00:39:51,523 --> 00:39:53,792
This couldn't
have waited till morning?

954
00:39:53,825 --> 00:39:56,662
Time-sensitive, I'm afraid.

955
00:39:56,695 --> 00:39:59,030
Or, in a way, the opposite.

956
00:40:00,666 --> 00:40:04,035
Just tell me
what you want.

957
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:06,472
Right. Well...

958
00:40:06,505 --> 00:40:08,874
we're both familiar
with the accomplice theory--

959
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:12,811
that our blind barbarian
had someone working for him.

960
00:40:12,844 --> 00:40:14,680
Yeah.

961
00:40:14,713 --> 00:40:16,114
Right, well, then

962
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:18,750
it occurred to me that,
what if the Sinnerman

963
00:40:18,784 --> 00:40:21,753
was the one working
for someone else?

964
00:40:21,787 --> 00:40:23,822
What if he was the accomplice?

965
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:27,859
Exhibit A.

966
00:40:27,893 --> 00:40:30,962
Here is Mr. Sinnerman
as a child.

967
00:40:30,996 --> 00:40:32,898
With a man

968
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:35,133
that he seems very close to.

969
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:37,769
Interesting birthmark.

970
00:40:37,803 --> 00:40:39,738
It's a very similar shape
to your military tattoo,

971
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:41,039
actually, wouldn't you agree?

972
00:40:41,072 --> 00:40:42,908
So?

973
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:44,543
Well, so it stands to reason

974
00:40:44,576 --> 00:40:47,546
that this man would be
very, very old by now.

975
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:49,981
Or, if he isn't,
he'd have to be...

976
00:40:50,015 --> 00:40:52,050
(chuckling):
...you know, immortal.

977
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:54,620
An immortal crime boss.

978
00:40:54,653 --> 00:40:55,721
Just like you're the Devil.

979
00:40:55,754 --> 00:40:57,122
(short chuckle)
Yes, I know,

980
00:40:57,155 --> 00:40:59,190
it does sound absurd,
doesn't it?

981
00:40:59,224 --> 00:41:00,926
So, as such, there's really only

982
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:04,062
one way to prove my theory.

983
00:41:04,095 --> 00:41:05,764
Where did I...

984
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:07,733
Ah, there it is.

985
00:41:11,637 --> 00:41:12,804
(grunting)

986
00:41:26,785 --> 00:41:28,720
(sniffs, sighs)

987
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:00,719
(softly clears throat)

988
00:42:00,752 --> 00:42:02,120
Aah!

989
00:42:02,153 --> 00:42:03,689
(grunting)

990
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,963
I wonder why I didn't
figure it out sooner.

991
00:42:11,997 --> 00:42:14,199
"The world's first murderer,

992
00:42:14,232 --> 00:42:15,701
"marked by God

993
00:42:15,734 --> 00:42:17,736
"and doomed
to walk the earth alone

994
00:42:17,769 --> 00:42:19,270
for a tortured eternity."

995
00:42:19,304 --> 00:42:21,006
It's quite the moniker.

996
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,074
Yet, still,

997
00:42:23,108 --> 00:42:25,911
nowhere near as ridiculous
as the Sinnerman.

998
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:29,881
(grunts)

999
00:42:29,915 --> 00:42:31,917
Wouldn't you agree...

1000
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:33,084
Kane?

1001
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:38,824
(panting)

1002
00:42:40,659 --> 00:42:42,594
(sighs)

1003
00:42:44,963 --> 00:42:47,198
You may as well
pour me one, too.
