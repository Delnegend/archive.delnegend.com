How's it going, Frank?

00:00:19,671 --> 00:00:21,717
You still kicking
that hernia's butt?

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,674
Nice.

00:00:22,718 --> 00:00:24,111
Morning, Jane.

00:00:24,154 --> 00:00:26,156
Talk about a buzzer-beater
last night, am I right?

00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,244
Bam!

Hey, guys.

13
00:00:28,376 --> 00:00:29,551
Morning.

14
00:00:30,726 --> 00:00:34,034
Oh, I like your hair today.Thank you.

15
00:00:39,735 --> 00:00:42,085
Tough break, Beth.

00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:45,697

what happened to you.

Hey, little brother.

20
00:00:53,575 --> 00:00:55,664
You did what?

21
00:00:55,707 --> 00:00:57,840
They said that?

22
00:00:57,883 --> 00:01:00,234
Well, that's never gonna happen.

23
00:01:00,277 --> 00:01:02,410
Seriously?

24
00:01:02,453 --> 00:01:04,281
Fine, okay.

Dude.

27
00:01:08,198 --> 00:01:09,417
What are you doing?

28
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,158
Well, this macro lens
gets so much more detail

29
00:01:11,201 --> 00:01:12,637
than my phone
camera does.Gross.

30
00:01:12,681 --> 00:01:14,726
Oh, someone's
a crabby-pants today.

31
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,119
How's it going, Ella?

32
00:01:16,163 --> 00:01:17,207
Couldn't be better.

33
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:18,730
Really?

34
00:01:19,992 --> 00:01:21,864
Sorry, my brother just called.

35
00:01:21,907 --> 00:01:23,909
Ah, right.
Well, family are the worst.

36
00:01:23,953 --> 00:01:25,389
Crab away.Well, apparently,

37
00:01:25,433 --> 00:01:29,132
uh, my brother moved back
to Detroit a week ago.

38
00:01:29,176 --> 00:01:31,308
And did he bother to
give me a heads-up?

39
00:01:31,352 --> 00:01:32,396
Uh, no, señor.

40
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,745
Not to mention
that he's the reason

41
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:35,356
I moved out to L.A.
in the first place.

42
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:38,794
And now my whole family wants me
to move back home, too.

43
00:01:42,014 --> 00:01:43,886
Are you considering
moving back home?

44
00:01:43,929 --> 00:01:47,107
Well, I mean, you guys know
how much I love it here, but...

45
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,630
they're my family.

46
00:01:48,673 --> 00:01:50,458
So, you know, yeah.

47
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:52,982
Well, Ella, you know, I'm... I'm
trying to be supportive, but...

48
00:01:53,025 --> 00:01:55,332
Well, I'm not.
Don't you dare go.

49
00:01:55,376 --> 00:01:57,334
I may not have a choice.

50
00:01:57,378 --> 00:01:58,857
Everyone has a choice, Ms. Lo...

51
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:01,817
Anyhoo, um,
so much going on here.

52
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,340
Let me show you.Mm-hmm.

53
00:02:03,384 --> 00:02:05,951
This right here is Dr. Beth
Daly, child psychiatrist.

54
00:02:05,995 --> 00:02:07,127
CHLOE:
Looks like blunt force trauma.

55
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,911
Someone hit her over the head?

56
00:02:08,954 --> 00:02:12,654
Yes, and yes, but there's
so much more to it than that.

57
00:02:12,697 --> 00:02:16,048
From what I can tell,
the killer was standing here

58
00:02:16,092 --> 00:02:17,876
when they grabbed
their murder weapon.

59
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,052
You see this spot in the dust,
right here?

60
00:02:20,096 --> 00:02:22,185
Fallen books,
and only one bookend.

61
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:23,665
So she was killed with
the missing bookend?

62
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:26,146
Mm, yes and no.
So the bookend...

63
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:27,756
[imitates impact]
made her woozy, right?

64
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:32,543
And then, she stumbled,
slipped on this toy train,

65
00:02:32,587 --> 00:02:35,677
grabbed this chair, fell back,

66
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,855
hit her head on this table and
bang, that's what killed her.

67
00:02:39,898 --> 00:02:41,422
Oh, bravo, Ms. Lopez.
See, that's another reason

68
00:02:41,465 --> 00:02:42,684
why you shouldn't leave.

69
00:02:42,727 --> 00:02:44,207
Crime scenes would be
so dull without you.

70
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:46,427
Thank you.
But wait, there's more.

71
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,342
There always is.I found

72
00:02:48,385 --> 00:02:51,519
a weird clump of hair
under Beth's nails.

73
00:02:51,562 --> 00:02:54,130
It's all gunky, too.Is that blood?

74
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,524
Mm, I can't really tell yet,
there's not enough of it.

75
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:58,221
I got to get it
back to the lab.

76
00:02:58,265 --> 00:03:00,354
CHLOE:
Hmm. Oh.

77
00:03:00,397 --> 00:03:03,705
Well, looks like there's a smear
here, like somebody tried

78
00:03:03,748 --> 00:03:05,533
to wipe away some blood.

79
00:03:05,576 --> 00:03:07,056
ELLA:
Good eye.

80
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:08,623
I'm thinking maybe the
girl who called it in?

81
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,842
Yeah.
Beckett Wilson.

82
00:03:10,886 --> 00:03:12,366
She was the doctor's
next patient.

83
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:15,238
She found the body,
she was pretty shaken up.

84
00:03:15,282 --> 00:03:16,935
Talk about shock therapy.

85
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:19,242
Well, I mean, wiping
blood off the wound

86
00:03:19,286 --> 00:03:21,549
is consistent with someone
who cares about the victim.

87
00:03:21,592 --> 00:03:24,029
Well, Dan took Beckett to
the precinct to calm her down,

88
00:03:24,073 --> 00:03:25,248
so I'll go check in with them.

89
00:03:25,292 --> 00:03:26,815
Okay, and I'll check
in with the lab,

90
00:03:26,858 --> 00:03:28,382
see if they can
rush this hair.
Great.

91
00:03:28,425 --> 00:03:29,687
All right.

92
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:31,950
I will check in
with the nearest pharmacy.

93
00:03:31,994 --> 00:03:34,431
DAN: No, she still
isn't talking.

94
00:03:34,475 --> 00:03:37,042
Poor kid's pretty traumatized.

95
00:03:39,175 --> 00:03:41,830
No, I don't see any blood
on her hands or her clothes.

96
00:03:41,873 --> 00:03:43,614
I'll ask her.

97
00:03:43,658 --> 00:03:45,094
Bye.

98
00:03:45,137 --> 00:03:46,748
[beeps]

99
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,271
[clears throat]

100
00:03:48,315 --> 00:03:51,361
Hey, Beckett?

101
00:03:51,405 --> 00:03:54,059
When you found the body,

102
00:03:54,103 --> 00:03:57,454
did you maybe try to
wipe up any blood?

103
00:03:57,498 --> 00:04:01,023
I don't think I did.

104
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:04,461
But it's all so fuzzy.

105
00:04:04,505 --> 00:04:07,116
Hey, it's okay.

106
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:08,639
[sniffles]

107
00:04:08,683 --> 00:04:09,988
We'll just talk later.

108
00:04:12,121 --> 00:04:15,298
Is there anything
I can do now?

109
00:04:15,342 --> 00:04:17,082
[sniffles]

110
00:04:17,126 --> 00:04:19,302
A Slurpee would be nice.

111
00:04:19,346 --> 00:04:22,697
A Slurpee it is.

112
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,873
See you, Frank.You, too.

113
00:04:33,534 --> 00:04:35,318
What's this?

114
00:04:50,855 --> 00:04:54,163
ANTHONY:
You don't possibly think
my son could've done this.

115
00:04:54,206 --> 00:04:56,818
No, Mr. Rodriguez,
Felix is not a suspect.

116
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:58,646
He doesn't fit the
forensic's profile.

117
00:04:58,689 --> 00:05:01,170
However, we did look
at Beth's appointment book,

118
00:05:01,213 --> 00:05:03,520
and he was scheduled
for much earlier this morning.

119
00:05:03,564 --> 00:05:06,001
So do you have any idea
why he was still here?

120
00:05:06,044 --> 00:05:07,481
Of course I do.

121
00:05:07,524 --> 00:05:09,526
He brought his violin
to his appointment this morning,

122
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,832
and he left it there.

123
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,355
The office isn't far
from our house,

124
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:14,531
so I let him ride his bike
back to get it.

125
00:05:14,575 --> 00:05:18,143
Well, we think Felix got here
shortly after Beth was killed.

126
00:05:18,187 --> 00:05:20,537
So we'd like to speak to him,
see if he saw anything.

127
00:05:20,581 --> 00:05:23,366
Well, that might be tough.

128
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:26,891
Uh, Felix is... shy.

129
00:05:26,935 --> 00:05:29,416
He struggles
with communication,

130
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:30,852
social skills.

131
00:05:30,895 --> 00:05:32,636
That's why he was
seeing Dr. Beth.

132
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,985
Mm.

133
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:35,291
I don't know
what we're gonna do without her.

134
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,598
I mean, she's helped
Felix so much.

135
00:05:37,641 --> 00:05:39,339
He's thriving
in school,

136
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:44,213
he's got all kinds of new
friends and-and interests.

137
00:05:44,256 --> 00:05:47,434
He's like a totally
different kid.

138
00:05:47,477 --> 00:05:50,393
He's just still not
very open with strangers.

139
00:05:50,437 --> 00:05:52,482
I see.

140
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,094
Hey, buddy.

141
00:05:56,138 --> 00:05:58,053
Can I help you get that off?

142
00:06:02,971 --> 00:06:06,801
You know, when I
was about your age,

143
00:06:06,844 --> 00:06:08,977
I was in a car accident.

144
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,283
It was pretty bad.

145
00:06:11,327 --> 00:06:16,419
I saw lots and
lots of blood.

146
00:06:16,463 --> 00:06:20,118
I know how scary
it can be.

147
00:06:20,162 --> 00:06:24,340
But you're gonna be okay.

148
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,256
I promise.

149
00:06:28,475 --> 00:06:30,781
[whispers]:
I didn't see who did it.

150
00:06:30,825 --> 00:06:33,567
Okay. Thanks for telling me.

151
00:06:35,351 --> 00:06:37,788
Oh, my gosh, mijito,
are you okay?

152
00:06:37,832 --> 00:06:40,487
What happened?Hey, let's just get
Felix home right now.

153
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:43,141
I'll explain everything
when we've all calmed down.

154
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:45,622
Here's my card.

155
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:48,582
If Felix thinks of anything
else, or mentions anything,

156
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,105
please, feel free to call me.

157
00:06:50,148 --> 00:06:51,411
All right.
Thank you.

158
00:06:59,549 --> 00:07:01,986
Well, aren't you
a little strange one?

159
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,336
WOMAN [whispering]:
I know you are, but what am I?

160
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,731
Ray-Ray?

161
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,820
What are you doing here?

162
00:07:09,864 --> 00:07:12,519
Now, is that any way to greet
one of your oldest friends?

163
00:07:12,562 --> 00:07:14,477
Okay, hi.

164
00:07:14,521 --> 00:07:16,348
We kind of sort of
agreed to never

165
00:07:16,392 --> 00:07:18,089
see each other again.Did we?

166
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:20,222
I don't remember putting
such a fine point on it.

167
00:07:20,265 --> 00:07:21,353
We did, we did. Super fine.

168
00:07:21,397 --> 00:07:22,746
Five years ago, in Detroit?

169
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,747
I know you remember.

170
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,532
Look, I'm sorry.

171
00:07:25,575 --> 00:07:27,403
I just... I miss you.

172
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,667
Okay, it's not that I don't
miss you, too, okay?

173
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:32,974
I just thought that
this part of my life was over.

174
00:07:33,017 --> 00:07:34,497
The part with you in it.

175
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,107
It's just...
it's a little too weird.

176
00:07:36,151 --> 00:07:38,545
Okay? So please,
just go away. Just...

177
00:07:38,588 --> 00:07:41,678

remember that,

194
00:08:22,414 --> 00:08:26,288
um, weird clump of hair
that I found on the vic?

195
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:27,724
Well, it turns out

196
00:08:27,768 --> 00:08:30,597
that it's a synthetic fur,
used to make anything

197
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,513
from carpets to,
uh, plush toys.

198
00:08:33,556 --> 00:08:35,384

under Beth's nails, right?

200
00:08:36,733 --> 00:08:37,908

201
00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:40,737
Nope. Turns out
that it was ketchup.

202
00:08:40,781 --> 00:08:42,870
Even though there wasn't a
scrap of food in the joint.

203
00:08:42,913 --> 00:08:46,090
So, uh, like I said, it
just came out of nowhere.

204
00:08:46,134 --> 00:08:48,179
Do you see why
it's so annoying?

205
00:08:48,223 --> 00:08:49,485
Okay, I'm gonna go
search Beth's house.

206
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,226
Maybe I'll find a match
to the fur there.

00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:52,575
Great. Uh,
I'll join you.

makes you extra
frickin' special.

Okay, first of all,
I see aghost-- aghost-- you.

I did feel special, okay?

But special or not,
it's not normal.

220

And since when
do you care about that?

that shrink thought

235
00:09:52,243 --> 00:09:54,898
that I was legitimately crazy
and put me on all those meds?

Wait. I-- okay, uh, I
didn't want to say this,

240
00:10:06,431 --> 00:10:08,869
but the reason why I'm here

241
00:10:08,912 --> 00:10:11,915
is to help you with,
you know, work stuff.

242
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:14,265
Why would a ghost want
to help me with work stuff?

00:10:14,962 --> 00:10:16,398
Ooh.

244

mentioned "ghost rules" before.

Well, you know,
I-I never had to.

253
00:10:33,937 --> 00:10:38,202
Okay, fine, so when this case
is over, you will go away again?

Fine, you can come with, okay?
But just lay low.

even notice I'm here.

for one second, man.

How could I possibly
know what she was planning?

259
00:10:52,303 --> 00:10:53,914
Uh, let me get this straight,

260
00:10:53,957 --> 00:10:56,133
you were tasked with escorting
the young lady to the precinct

261
00:10:56,177 --> 00:10:58,353
and she ran away
with your phone.

262
00:10:58,396 --> 00:11:00,703
Yes, with my phone.
Ooh!

263
00:11:00,747 --> 00:11:01,922
Clearly, Beckett manipulated me,

264
00:11:01,965 --> 00:11:03,401
which means she wasn't
really upset

265
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:04,576

266

than we thought.

where's Beckett?

524
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,504
Oh, that little girl
is so helpful.

525
00:22:55,548 --> 00:22:57,463
She's the one who introduced
me to Gemma, actually.
Hmm.

526
00:22:57,506 --> 00:23:00,596
Yeah, she just ran off to get
us a couple of churro...

527
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,511
Oh.

528
00:23:02,555 --> 00:23:03,643
[Dan laughing]

529
00:23:05,688 --> 00:23:06,863
In your face.

530
00:23:06,907 --> 00:23:08,778
She read you like a book.

531
00:23:08,822 --> 00:23:11,433
All day long you're making fun
of me for getting duped by a kid

532
00:23:11,477 --> 00:23:12,782
and you lost her, too.[chuckles]

533
00:23:12,826 --> 00:23:15,785
You lost her.

534
00:23:15,829 --> 00:23:17,221
Oh, that's bad.

535
00:23:17,265 --> 00:23:18,832
This is really bad.

536
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:21,530
Daniel, you don't happen to have
my car keys on you, do you?

537
00:23:23,184 --> 00:23:24,228
What?

538
00:23:24,272 --> 00:23:27,231
She took my badge.

539
00:23:27,275 --> 00:23:28,885
Oh. Well...

540
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:31,410
good news is at least
I got your phone back.

541

That little bitch.

542
00:23:39,983 --> 00:23:42,638
Fingerprints on the broom
are too smudged to I.D.

543
00:23:42,682 --> 00:23:44,858
All I got were traces
of chalk and rosin.

544
00:23:44,901 --> 00:23:48,514
Rosin?
Yeah, a substance
with, like, a gajillion uses:

545
00:23:48,557 --> 00:23:52,082
adhesives, soap, chewing gum,
hard to narrow down.

546
00:23:52,126 --> 00:23:53,519
I think I got something.

547
00:23:53,562 --> 00:23:55,608
This is surveillance footage

548
00:23:55,651 --> 00:23:57,348
from the traffic light
near Beth's office.

549
00:23:57,392 --> 00:24:00,482
This car sped away
after your tussle with that man

550
00:24:00,526 --> 00:24:03,224
and was there during the fight
that Iris told us about.

551
00:24:03,267 --> 00:24:04,486
Sweet.
Sweet.

552
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,140
Who is it?

553
00:24:06,183 --> 00:24:08,882
Well, the license plate
and the driver aren't visible,

554
00:24:08,925 --> 00:24:10,057
but we do have this.

555
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,363
It's a bumper sticker

556
00:24:12,407 --> 00:24:13,539
from Rancho Middle School

557
00:24:13,582 --> 00:24:14,888
where Felix and
Beckett attend.

558
00:24:14,931 --> 00:24:17,020
Chalk on the broom.
I-It could be a teacher.

559
00:24:17,064 --> 00:24:19,414
I know.
Hmm?

560
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:23,462
We know that there was chalk
on the broom, right?

561
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:25,507
Could be a teacher.

562
00:24:25,551 --> 00:24:26,943
Mm, maybe, but which one?

563
00:24:26,987 --> 00:24:30,251
Well, you know what else
rosin is used for?

564
00:24:30,294 --> 00:24:31,774
A violin bow.

565
00:24:31,818 --> 00:24:34,864
Didn't Felix leave his violin
in Beth's office?

566
00:24:34,908 --> 00:24:36,300
Look up the music teacher.

567
00:24:36,344 --> 00:24:38,389
CHLOE:
There he is, Jonathan Burke.

568
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:43,394
You're good.
[laughs]

569
00:24:43,438 --> 00:24:46,528
Okay. Yes, I-I was
in Beth's office,

570
00:24:46,572 --> 00:24:48,269
but I'm really sorry
I scared you.

571
00:24:48,312 --> 00:24:49,575
What were you trying to do?

572
00:24:49,618 --> 00:24:51,577
Destroy evidence that
you murdered Beth?!

573
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:55,885
No, no. I was, um, I was going
to retrieve this.

574
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,888
A check for five grand.

575
00:24:58,932 --> 00:25:01,369
I was worried that it would
lead the police to me.

576
00:25:02,283 --> 00:25:04,111
What was the money for?

577
00:25:04,154 --> 00:25:05,547
Felix is my best student.

578
00:25:05,591 --> 00:25:07,462
He's the best student
I've ever seen.

579
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,333
The kid is destined
for stardom.

580
00:25:09,377 --> 00:25:11,597
I was hoping that
he'd take me with him.

581
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,555
So, what? You were trying
to bribe Beth

582
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:16,863
because she was helping him
to spend less time on violin

583
00:25:16,906 --> 00:25:18,168
and be more social?

584
00:25:18,212 --> 00:25:20,606
The opposite. Beth recommended
that he play more.

585
00:25:20,649 --> 00:25:23,478
Start homeschooling
and take private lessons,

586
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,306
leaving me behind.

587
00:25:25,349 --> 00:25:28,701
So you were trying to bribe her
to change that recommendation.

588
00:25:28,744 --> 00:25:30,137
It still sounds
like motive.

589
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,618
Well, I have an alibi.
Mm.

590
00:25:32,661 --> 00:25:35,316
I was teaching ninth grade
chamber class

591
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:36,578
when Beth was murdered.

592
00:25:36,622 --> 00:25:38,275
You-you can call the school.

593
00:25:40,016 --> 00:25:43,498
If that's actually true,
then we're back to bupkes.

594
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,326
Unless Dan got a lead
from Beckett.

595
00:25:45,369 --> 00:25:46,806
Beckett Wilson?

596
00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:49,373
Well, it figures that
she'd be involved.

597
00:25:49,417 --> 00:25:50,636
She a student of yours?

598
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:52,681
Was. The kid's a nightmare.

599
00:25:52,725 --> 00:25:55,031
I nearly ran her over
this morning on her scooter.

600
00:25:55,075 --> 00:25:56,816
She was ditching first period.

601
00:25:56,859 --> 00:26:00,907
Where are Beckett
and Dan, anyhow?

602
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:03,170
[tires screeching]What, Beckett?

603
00:26:03,213 --> 00:26:06,042
Yup. I'm looking right at her.

Dan, where are you?

605
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,437
You were supposed to be
at the precinct hours ago.

606
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,352
I... uh, yeah.

00:26:11,395 --> 00:26:13,136
Sorry. Battery.[phone beeps]

I mean, it is your car.

610
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,012
Oh, I'll get it back,
unlike your dignity.

612

It's a big deal now.
All right?

616
00:26:30,545 --> 00:26:31,590
I just talked to Chloe.

617
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:33,548
Beckett, she's a suspect.

618
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,202
So we got to call in
some backup.

619
00:26:35,245 --> 00:26:37,683
Agreed. Agreed.

620
00:26:37,726 --> 00:26:41,295

best at hunting down humans.

Just say it.

698
00:30:41,927 --> 00:30:43,711
I understand why you
chickened out.

699
00:30:43,754 --> 00:30:45,887
It was too risky, okay?

700
00:30:45,931 --> 00:30:47,671
You do?

701
00:30:47,715 --> 00:30:50,500
Yeah. You're afraid that
people, even nice people,

702
00:30:50,544 --> 00:30:54,548
wouldn't accept people
who talk to dead people.

703
00:30:54,591 --> 00:30:56,463
But...
No but. Okay?

704
00:30:56,506 --> 00:30:58,682
You don't know what it's like
to tell someone the truth

705
00:30:58,726 --> 00:31:01,337
and have them look at you
with pity in their eyes

706
00:31:01,381 --> 00:31:03,035
like you're crazy.

707
00:31:04,514 --> 00:31:07,909
And if my friends here
ever looked at me like that,

708
00:31:07,953 --> 00:31:09,868
it would break my heart.

709
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:11,217
I think your
coworkers here

710
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:13,132
are real friends, like Chloe...

711
00:31:13,175 --> 00:31:15,525
Chloe is the nicest person ever.

712
00:31:15,569 --> 00:31:17,092
Okay? But she's all about things

713
00:31:17,136 --> 00:31:19,051
that she can see
and prove

714
00:31:19,094 --> 00:31:21,401
and I don't think
that she'd get it.

715
00:31:21,444 --> 00:31:26,580
And the truth is, I don't want
to give her the chance not to.

716
00:31:30,453 --> 00:31:31,585
Ray-Ray.

717
00:31:31,628 --> 00:31:33,717
The neighbors have
a construction dumpster.

718
00:31:33,761 --> 00:31:35,850
Holy smokes.

719
00:31:42,248 --> 00:31:44,554
You know, I love
your perfume.

720
00:31:44,598 --> 00:31:45,642
What is that? Freesia?

721
00:31:45,686 --> 00:31:48,776
Yes. Thank you.That music,

722
00:31:48,819 --> 00:31:50,038
it's beautiful.

723
00:31:50,082 --> 00:31:51,431
You must be so
proud of Felix.

724
00:31:51,474 --> 00:31:52,780
He's so talented.

725
00:31:52,823 --> 00:31:55,304
Well, he never puts
that violin down.
Really?

726
00:31:55,348 --> 00:31:57,872
My daughter, she goes through
interests like candy.

727
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,830
I can't get her to
commit to anything.

728
00:31:59,874 --> 00:32:02,094
Commitment has never
been Felix's problem.

729
00:32:02,137 --> 00:32:03,791
He loves his violin.

730
00:32:03,834 --> 00:32:05,967
Once, he walked out the door
without pants,

731
00:32:06,011 --> 00:32:07,882
but he still
had his violin.

732
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,275
[both laugh]

733
00:32:09,318 --> 00:32:12,365
So, he would never
leave it behind,

734
00:32:12,408 --> 00:32:13,932
like at a therapist's office?

735
00:32:13,975 --> 00:32:16,108
Oh, God no.
He sleeps with the thing.

736
00:32:16,151 --> 00:32:18,632
Hmm. And how
did you feel

737
00:32:18,675 --> 00:32:21,069
when Beth recommended that
Felix do homeschooling

738
00:32:21,113 --> 00:32:23,942
so he could play
violin full-time?

739
00:32:23,985 --> 00:32:26,466
I'm sorry,
but that's not right.

740
00:32:26,509 --> 00:32:29,251
Um, Beth recommended that
Felix stay in his school.

741
00:32:29,295 --> 00:32:30,949
In fact,
she was encouraging him

742
00:32:30,992 --> 00:32:34,039
to branch out
with new activities.

743
00:32:34,082 --> 00:32:37,607
At least,
that's what Anthony told me.

744
00:32:37,651 --> 00:32:40,045
And where is Anthony now?

745
00:32:44,049 --> 00:32:46,355
What the heck
are you doing?

746
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:47,704
Where would you hide
a murder weapon?

747
00:32:47,748 --> 00:32:50,011
Not in your trash.
That is way too easy.

748
00:32:50,055 --> 00:32:51,360
Your neighbor's trash, maybe.

749
00:32:51,404 --> 00:32:53,362
But a construction dumpster?
Perfect.

750
00:32:53,406 --> 00:32:54,973
You're really good
at this stuff, you know.

751
00:32:55,016 --> 00:32:57,236
Even though it is, um, gross.

752
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,716
Yeah. I mean,
this is my thang!

753
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,196
And you know what they say.

754
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:05,548
One man's trash is
a forensic scientist's treasure.

755
00:33:07,811 --> 00:33:10,510
One murder weapon,

756
00:33:10,553 --> 00:33:13,817
with dried blood
from the victim to boot.

757
00:33:13,861 --> 00:33:15,080
[dumpster clangs]Duck!

758
00:33:18,213 --> 00:33:20,955
I really wish
you hadn't found that.

759
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:29,964
CHLOE:
Freeze!

760
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,661
Lower the bat, Anthony.
It's over.

761
00:33:31,705 --> 00:33:34,577
We know Felix didn't leave
his violin at Beth's.

762
00:33:34,621 --> 00:33:35,839
He followed you there,

763
00:33:35,883 --> 00:33:39,060
and has been covering
for you ever since.

764
00:33:39,104 --> 00:33:41,410
You don't understand.

765
00:33:41,454 --> 00:33:45,545
I sent Felix to Beth
to help him,

766
00:33:45,588 --> 00:33:48,026
not make him worse.

767
00:33:48,069 --> 00:33:49,114
He doesn't have any friends.

768
00:33:49,157 --> 00:33:51,029
He doesn't have a life.

769
00:33:51,072 --> 00:33:53,248
"Play the violin more."

770
00:33:53,292 --> 00:33:55,076
That's not normal.

771
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,383
ELLA: You're right,
that's not normal.

772
00:33:57,426 --> 00:33:59,907
It's amazing.

773
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,648
And that's what
makes him special.

774
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:09,090
CHLOE: Put your hands
behind your back.

775
00:34:09,134 --> 00:34:10,570
[drops bat]

776
00:34:16,141 --> 00:34:17,751
Thanks.

777
00:34:19,666 --> 00:34:20,797
[sighs]

778
00:34:20,841 --> 00:34:23,148
I see ghosts.

779
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:27,717
Well, more like "ghost."

780
00:34:27,761 --> 00:34:30,459
I see one ghost.

781
00:34:30,503 --> 00:34:32,461
Okay, um...

782
00:34:32,505 --> 00:34:35,247
I think I'm gonna need
a bit more.

783
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:38,337
Okay, so...

784
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,816
when I was eight years old,

785
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:42,471
I was in a really,
really bad car wreck.

786
00:34:42,515 --> 00:34:46,388
And-and that's when I
saw her for the first time.

787
00:34:46,432 --> 00:34:49,391
And at first, I thought
she was just a figment

788
00:34:49,435 --> 00:34:52,307
of my imagination,
from the trauma.

789
00:34:52,351 --> 00:34:55,136
But she kept coming back.

790
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:57,443
And-and-and then I thought

791
00:34:57,486 --> 00:34:59,358
she was just an
imaginary friend.

792
00:34:59,401 --> 00:35:02,839
But as I got older,
I realized

793
00:35:02,883 --> 00:35:05,494
that she wasn't imaginary,
she was real,

794
00:35:05,538 --> 00:35:10,543
because she felt so...
so real to me.

795
00:35:10,586 --> 00:35:14,373
And that's when she
told me she was a ghost.

796
00:35:14,416 --> 00:35:18,507
So I have a friend
who's a ghost.

797
00:35:18,551 --> 00:35:21,162
Or at least-- at least
I hope that's what she is,

798
00:35:21,206 --> 00:35:23,773
'cause if it really is
just all in my head,

799
00:35:23,817 --> 00:35:26,428
then I'm legit crazy.

800
00:35:28,387 --> 00:35:30,040
Do you think I'm crazy?

801
00:35:30,084 --> 00:35:32,608
No.

802
00:35:32,652 --> 00:35:35,307
It-It's...

803
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:39,224
definitely
a-a lot to process...

804
00:35:39,267 --> 00:35:42,879
but no, Ella,
I don't think you're crazy.

805
00:35:42,923 --> 00:35:45,882
Honestly, I have seen

806
00:35:45,926 --> 00:35:50,539
a lot crazier things.

807
00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:53,368
Like, a lot.

808
00:35:53,412 --> 00:35:56,458
And besides,
there is nothing that...

809
00:35:56,502 --> 00:35:58,199
that you could tell me
that would change

810
00:35:58,243 --> 00:35:59,592
they way I feel about you.

811
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:04,031
Come here.

812
00:36:04,074 --> 00:36:06,251
[sniffles]

813
00:36:06,294 --> 00:36:07,948
You okay?

814
00:36:07,991 --> 00:36:10,559
I've never been better.

815
00:36:13,127 --> 00:36:16,522
Oh, and any news
on the move to Detroit?

816
00:36:16,565 --> 00:36:18,741
[scoffs]
Detroit schmetroit.

817
00:36:18,785 --> 00:36:20,352
I ain't moving back there.Oh...

818
00:36:20,395 --> 00:36:22,658
Hell no.
[laughs]

819
00:36:22,702 --> 00:36:23,790
Yeah, girl!

820
00:36:25,444 --> 00:36:28,229
Makes me so happy.
Thanks.

821
00:36:28,273 --> 00:36:30,710
Good job tonight.
Thanks.

822
00:36:33,147 --> 00:36:36,281
RAY-RAY:
Told ya.

823
00:36:38,326 --> 00:36:41,024
See? I told you
your friends are great.

824
00:36:41,068 --> 00:36:43,157
[sighs]
The best.

825
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:47,117
So... a deal's a deal.

826
00:36:47,161 --> 00:36:50,120
I said I would leave after,
uh, this case was closed,

827
00:36:50,164 --> 00:36:53,036
so I guess this is adios.

828
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:56,518
Uh, wait...
question.

829
00:36:56,562 --> 00:36:59,042
If you say you're here
to look out for me,

830
00:36:59,086 --> 00:37:02,263
is that what you've been doing
since the car wreck?

831
00:37:02,307 --> 00:37:05,484
Sort of like a...
I don't know,

832
00:37:05,527 --> 00:37:07,790
ghost guardian angel?

833
00:37:07,834 --> 00:37:10,924
You could say I'm just a
friend who's got your back.

834
00:37:10,967 --> 00:37:15,233
Well, I suppose you can
check on my back,

835
00:37:15,276 --> 00:37:17,626
you know, once in a while.

836
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:20,281
But, seriously, don't
spy on me in the shower.

837
00:37:20,325 --> 00:37:22,283
Deal.

838
00:37:22,327 --> 00:37:25,634
Well, smell you later, Lopez.

839
00:37:30,117 --> 00:37:32,554
ELLA:
Uh, what is that?

840
00:37:32,598 --> 00:37:34,643
Well, I think
it speaks for itself,

841
00:37:34,687 --> 00:37:37,211
but unfortunately,
I'm sworn to secrecy.

842
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,212
[chuckles]

843
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,083
Hmm.

844
00:37:40,127 --> 00:37:42,956
Well, you do you.

845
00:37:42,999 --> 00:37:45,219
Oh, I always do.

846
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,960
Smell you later,
Lucifer.

847
00:37:48,527 --> 00:37:49,702
Uh, Ms. Lopez?

848
00:37:49,745 --> 00:37:51,181
Hmm?

849
00:37:51,225 --> 00:37:53,967
Since when do you use
that particular turn of phrase,

850
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:55,316
"Smell you later"?

851
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,796
I've never heard you
say that before.

852
00:37:56,839 --> 00:38:01,279
Oh, it's just something
my friend Ray-Ray says.

853
00:38:08,242 --> 00:38:09,417
[elevator bell dings]

854
00:38:17,251 --> 00:38:19,427
I know you're here.

855
00:38:22,474 --> 00:38:26,304
Come on,
time to show yourself.

856
00:38:26,347 --> 00:38:28,480
[whooshing]

857
00:38:29,437 --> 00:38:30,917
[chuckles softly]

858
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,789
Well, hello, Azrael.

859
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:36,357
What, too cool to
call me Ray-Ray anymore?

860
00:38:36,401 --> 00:38:38,577
Well, endearing nicknames
are reserved for siblings

861
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:41,275
who didn't abandon me
for millennia, so...

862
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,321
[sighs]

863
00:38:43,364 --> 00:38:46,149
I didn't abandon you.
I've been busy.

864
00:38:46,193 --> 00:38:47,499
Oh.

865
00:38:47,542 --> 00:38:49,414
I mean, you try being
the Angel of Death.

866
00:38:49,457 --> 00:38:52,199
A lot of people die, Lu.You're telling me.

867
00:38:52,242 --> 00:38:53,635
Okay, I get it, you're pissed.

868
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:54,984
I should have
reached out to you

869
00:38:55,028 --> 00:38:56,551
when Dad kicked your butt
down to Hell.

870
00:38:56,595 --> 00:38:58,945
And I was going to,
but, you know,

871
00:38:58,988 --> 00:39:01,469
a day turned into a week,
which turned to, you know,

872
00:39:01,513 --> 00:39:02,601
a thousand years,

873
00:39:02,644 --> 00:39:04,951
and then it just seemed weird.

874
00:39:04,994 --> 00:39:07,954
Well, congratulations.
Weirdness averted.

875
00:39:07,997 --> 00:39:10,217
Uh, you weren't there, Lu.
You don't know.

876
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,566
When Dad kicked you out,

877
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:14,613
the whole family was rocked,
me especially.

878
00:39:14,656 --> 00:39:17,616
Oh, really?
Why is that?
Because,

879
00:39:17,659 --> 00:39:21,010
I lost my favorite
big brother, you dope.

880
00:39:21,054 --> 00:39:23,404
[scoffs]

881
00:39:23,448 --> 00:39:24,840
Come on, Lu.

882
00:39:24,884 --> 00:39:26,799
Remember when we
used to prank Amenadiel?

883
00:39:26,842 --> 00:39:30,193
Please tell me he still has
that hilarious angry face.

884
00:39:30,237 --> 00:39:32,457
[chuckles]

885
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,633
Still angry.
Still hilarious.

886
00:39:34,676 --> 00:39:38,332
Mostly, I just missed you
listening to me

887
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,813
drone on about whatever
was on my mind.

888
00:39:40,856 --> 00:39:44,164
I know it may have not
meant much to you,

889
00:39:44,207 --> 00:39:46,558
but it mattered
a lot to me.

890
00:39:46,601 --> 00:39:50,910
Look, I-I'm sorry.
I-I made a mistake.

891
00:39:50,953 --> 00:39:55,044
But you started
a freaking rebellion, Lucifer.

892
00:39:55,088 --> 00:39:56,176
Nobody's perfect.

893
00:39:56,219 --> 00:39:57,960
[scoffs]

894
00:39:58,004 --> 00:40:01,660
I suppose you're
right about that.

895
00:40:01,703 --> 00:40:03,923
But why are you here now,

896
00:40:03,966 --> 00:40:06,012
and how does Ms. Lopez
know of you?

897
00:40:06,055 --> 00:40:07,230
Oh, that.

898
00:40:07,274 --> 00:40:08,667
Oh, don't worry,
I'm not Dad.

899
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:11,234
I have no qualms with you
interacting with humans.

900
00:40:11,278 --> 00:40:13,236
[sighs]
Well, come on.

901
00:40:14,586 --> 00:40:17,502
Ella was in a gnarly car wreck

902
00:40:17,545 --> 00:40:19,504
when she was young,
and I showed up to,

903
00:40:19,547 --> 00:40:21,375
you know, do my
Angel of Death thing.

904
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,899
But what, false alarm?

905
00:40:23,943 --> 00:40:25,292
It happens.

906
00:40:25,335 --> 00:40:29,688
This time, I don't know,
I-I didn't want to leave.

907
00:40:29,731 --> 00:40:30,863
I mean, you know Ella.

908
00:40:30,906 --> 00:40:32,299
There's just
something about her.

909
00:40:32,342 --> 00:40:35,215
She's so positive.
She makes you feel like...

910
00:40:35,258 --> 00:40:37,478
Good about yourself.

911
00:40:37,522 --> 00:40:38,827
Yeah! Exactly!

912
00:40:38,871 --> 00:40:41,221
I only ever get to
talk to deadhumans.

913
00:40:41,264 --> 00:40:43,049
I mean, they're so morose.

914
00:40:43,092 --> 00:40:45,791
Anyway, whenever I was
in the neighborhood,

915
00:40:45,834 --> 00:40:48,489
I'd stop by, see
how she was doing,

916
00:40:48,533 --> 00:40:49,795
and we became friends.

917
00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:52,711
But apparently,
it's weird

918
00:40:52,754 --> 00:40:55,017
if people talk to
invisible angels.

919
00:40:55,061 --> 00:40:58,934
So I told her I was a ghost,
which didn't help.

920
00:40:58,978 --> 00:41:03,025
So I sent her to be
out here with you.

921
00:41:03,069 --> 00:41:06,464
You did what?

922
00:41:06,507 --> 00:41:08,727
First, Dad puts
the detective here,

923
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:11,556
and now you're trying
to manipulate me with Ms. Lopez.

924
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:14,559
Why does everyone think
I need help meeting women?

925
00:41:14,602 --> 00:41:18,388
Relax.
I-I didn't do it for you,

926
00:41:18,432 --> 00:41:19,825
I did it for her.

927
00:41:21,566 --> 00:41:23,698
Well, both of you, I guess.

928
00:41:23,742 --> 00:41:26,353
See, since I couldn't really
be with her,

929
00:41:26,396 --> 00:41:28,181
and I couldn't be with you,

930
00:41:28,224 --> 00:41:32,272
I thought at least
two of my favorite people

931
00:41:32,315 --> 00:41:33,403
could be together.

932
00:41:33,447 --> 00:41:34,927
[chuckles softly]

933
00:41:37,277 --> 00:41:39,148
And that's the only reason
that you're here?

934
00:41:39,192 --> 00:41:41,847
Pretty much.

935
00:41:44,632 --> 00:41:45,851

936
00:41:45,894 --> 00:41:47,983

Yes. I was just wondering
how it's going

947
00:42:17,709 --> 00:42:19,667
with my good friend,
Ms. Lopez,

948
00:42:19,711 --> 00:42:22,757
as I just heard you'll be
staying with us a while longer.

00:42:24,106 --> 00:42:26,805
Excellent choice,
by the way.

951
00:42:29,634 --> 00:42:31,113
Yeah, I mean,
I was just, you know,

952
00:42:31,157 --> 00:42:33,551
comparing DNA on a block
of regular wood

953
00:42:33,594 --> 00:42:34,813
versus synthetic wood.

954
00:42:34,856 --> 00:42:36,684
Oh.
So, the cells
in the synthetic--

955
00:42:36,728 --> 00:42:38,686
Sorry, you were probably
just being polite.

956
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:39,948
No, no, no, no.
Not at all.

Please, tell me more.
I'm all ears.

Oh, well, it's fascinating.

959
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:48,609
See, the plastic
preserves the DNA.

960
00:42:48,653 --> 00:42:50,219
Right? But with
the regular wood,

961
00:42:50,263 --> 00:42:52,308
the cells get soaked up,
kind of like, um,

962
00:42:52,352 --> 00:42:54,659
