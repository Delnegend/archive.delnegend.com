Lucifer's the reason

8
00:00:14,753 --> 00:00:15,885
that I said yes to Pierce.

9
00:00:15,928 --> 00:00:17,713
He's also the reason
that I said no.

10
00:00:17,756 --> 00:00:19,845
Okay, you could kill me, sure.

Have you spoken
to Amenadiel?

Why?Well, I know

67
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,027
he and Charlotte were close.
He might know something.

68
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,290
I can talk to him myself
if you have an idea where he is.

69
00:02:40,334 --> 00:02:42,292
Well, I think I know
exactly where he is.

70
00:02:42,336 --> 00:02:43,467
You do?

71
00:02:43,511 --> 00:02:45,991
Yes.

I'm-I'm not following.

73
00:02:49,995 --> 00:02:51,780
Well, it appears

74
00:02:51,823 --> 00:02:53,390
that my brother
got his wings back.

75
00:02:53,434 --> 00:02:54,826
How is that possible?

76
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,569
[chuckles softly]
Amenadiel had a crazy theory--

77
00:02:58,613 --> 00:03:00,136
or so I thought--

78
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,659
that everything
that's happened to us,

79
00:03:01,703 --> 00:03:03,487
him losing his wings,
me gaining mine,

80
00:03:03,531 --> 00:03:04,619
even my lost Devil face...

81
00:03:04,662 --> 00:03:06,316
And you believe that?Well, I didn't.

82
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,059
But I'm fairly certain
he's up in Heaven now

83
00:03:10,102 --> 00:03:12,104
and took dear Charlotte
with him,

84
00:03:12,148 --> 00:03:14,803
so perhaps
there's something to it.

85
00:03:14,846 --> 00:03:16,500
You think Amenadiel's
gone forever?Well, who knows

86
00:03:16,544 --> 00:03:17,762
if he'll ever return,

87
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:19,634

in the Silver City.

00:08:09,271 --> 00:08:10,620
You freakin' knew?

185
00:08:10,664 --> 00:08:11,795
Daniel, Daniel!You...

186
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:13,493
Daniel, like you said.

187
00:08:13,536 --> 00:08:14,624
Please, be careful,

188
00:08:14,668 --> 00:08:15,799
people are watching.

189
00:08:15,843 --> 00:08:17,279
Okay?

190
00:08:17,322 --> 00:08:18,628
Good? Yes?

191
00:08:20,674 --> 00:08:23,633
This cannot be true. Can it?

192
00:08:23,677 --> 00:08:26,636
I mean... if you knew this,
why wouldn't you say something?

193
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,246
I mean, I almost married him.

194
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,510
I mean,
I almost married him.

195
00:08:30,553 --> 00:08:32,337
I tried to tell you,
but you wouldn't listen.

196
00:08:32,381 --> 00:08:34,165
No, you said he's immortal,

197
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:35,819
and that is something
completely different.

198
00:08:35,863 --> 00:08:37,691
Is it? If I'd told you
he was The Sinnerman as well,

199
00:08:37,734 --> 00:08:39,519
would you have believed me?I don't know,

200
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:40,998
maybe!

201
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:43,000
Maybe, because that's something
that actually exists,

202
00:08:43,044 --> 00:08:45,481
and not some metaphor
that you've made up.

203
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,743
I haven't made up anything,
Detective,

204
00:08:46,787 --> 00:08:48,658
I always tell you the truth,
no matter what.

205
00:08:48,702 --> 00:08:50,181
DAN:
Okay, ignoring

206
00:08:50,225 --> 00:08:52,836
all the craziness,
do you believe me, Chloe?

207
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,535
I-I...

208
00:08:55,578 --> 00:08:57,406
I don't see anything in here
that proves it.

209
00:08:57,449 --> 00:08:59,495
Pierce wants
to talk to everyone.

210
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,237
PIERCE: Charlotte Richards
was one of us.

211
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,239
She fought tooth and nail

212
00:09:04,282 --> 00:09:06,502
to make sure
that our arrests stuck.

213
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:11,202
To make sure that the bad
guys stayed off the streets.

214
00:09:11,246 --> 00:09:13,248
And now...
[sighs]

215
00:09:16,077 --> 00:09:18,166
Pierce doesn't get emotional.

216
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:19,950
[sniffles]

217
00:09:19,994 --> 00:09:21,125
Now she's gone.

218
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:24,128
I don't like this. He's lying.

219
00:09:24,172 --> 00:09:26,391
But we will find
whoever did this.

220
00:09:26,435 --> 00:09:28,698
We need to get justice
for Charlotte.

221
00:09:28,742 --> 00:09:31,309
If it's the last thing
that we do.

222
00:09:31,353 --> 00:09:32,789
He did it, didn't he?

223
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,443
He killed Charlotte.

224
00:09:34,486 --> 00:09:36,271
It appears so, Detective.

225
00:09:36,314 --> 00:09:39,579
And now he's overseeing
the whole damn investigation.

226
00:09:39,622 --> 00:09:42,451
How do we take him down?

227
00:09:42,494 --> 00:09:44,496
♪

228
00:09:57,858 --> 00:09:59,816
How do we approach this?

229
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,819
You buy me five minutes
in interrogation with that dick,

230
00:10:02,863 --> 00:10:05,213
and I swear to you,
I will break him.Dan.

231
00:10:05,256 --> 00:10:06,823
You're gonna need to get
a hold of your anger.

232
00:10:06,867 --> 00:10:08,433
I know
it's not easy.

233
00:10:08,477 --> 00:10:10,522
It's the only way
that we can bring him down.

234
00:10:10,566 --> 00:10:11,654
Can you do that?

235
00:10:11,698 --> 00:10:14,396
Yeah.

236
00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:15,615
I can.

237
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:17,660
I have no choice.Yeah, she's right.

238
00:10:17,704 --> 00:10:19,662
Pierce is more formidable
than either of you realize.

239
00:10:19,706 --> 00:10:22,360
We are talking about the world's
first killer, after all.

240
00:10:22,404 --> 00:10:24,667
And you.
No more of your metaphors.

241
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:26,626
They're not metaphors.We need to focus
on Pierce.

242
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:28,453
But when this is all done,
you and I are gonna talk

243
00:10:28,497 --> 00:10:30,281
about everything that you've
been keeping from me.

244
00:10:30,325 --> 00:10:32,283
Very well.

245
00:10:32,327 --> 00:10:33,937
Great.

246
00:10:33,981 --> 00:10:36,070
What's our first move?

247
00:10:36,113 --> 00:10:38,376
Well, Pierce still needs
to cover his tracks,

248
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,466
so if I were him,
I'd be looking for a fall guy.

249
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,251
This was just found
at the crime scene.

250
00:10:43,294 --> 00:10:44,339
I totally missed
the little bugger

251
00:10:44,382 --> 00:10:45,383
in the first couple
of canvasses.

252
00:10:45,427 --> 00:10:47,995
I mean, thank God
Pierce held off

253
00:10:48,038 --> 00:10:50,040
on releasing the scene
until we did a third sweep.

254
00:10:50,084 --> 00:10:51,215
We may have never found it.

255
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:52,390
Oh, I guarantee
you wouldn't have.

256
00:10:52,434 --> 00:10:53,783
Did you find any DNA on it?

257
00:10:53,827 --> 00:10:55,698
Yeah and we got a match.

258
00:10:55,742 --> 00:10:58,309
A guy named Steve Chamberlain.

259
00:10:58,353 --> 00:11:00,224
That's one of the men that
Charlotte was gonna prosecute.

260
00:11:00,268 --> 00:11:02,357
A hedge fund manager
that was using a charity

261
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,706
to embezzle money.

262
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,316
Sounds exactly like
the kind of dirtbag

263
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,231
who would do something
this terrible.CHLOE: Hey, Ella,

264
00:11:07,275 --> 00:11:10,713
there's something
that I need you to...

265
00:11:10,757 --> 00:11:12,106
[clears throat]There's something
that you should do.

266
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:13,542
Okay, so if they found this,

267
00:11:13,585 --> 00:11:14,848
at the scene, there's probably
more evidence,

268
00:11:14,891 --> 00:11:16,719
so have the team
do another sweep.

269
00:11:16,763 --> 00:11:18,852
You got it.We have a lead?

270
00:11:18,895 --> 00:11:20,680
Yeah.

271
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:23,552
Uh, DNA at the scene points
to one of the criminals

272
00:11:23,595 --> 00:11:25,032
that Charlotte
was gonna prosecute.

273
00:11:25,075 --> 00:11:27,469
That's great.

274
00:11:27,512 --> 00:11:28,862
Well, keep me posted.

275
00:11:28,905 --> 00:11:30,385
Let me know if there's
anything you need.

276
00:11:30,428 --> 00:11:31,734
Yeah, will do.

277
00:11:31,778 --> 00:11:34,302
Espinoza.

278
00:11:34,345 --> 00:11:35,999
Uh, yeah, Lieutenant?

279
00:11:36,043 --> 00:11:37,435
Thought I told you to go home.

280
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:40,395
Yes, sir, you did.

281
00:11:42,397 --> 00:11:44,834
Well, if I were you,
I would still be here, too.

282
00:11:44,878 --> 00:11:46,401
If there's anything
you need...

283
00:11:46,444 --> 00:11:50,144
I need... to catch the bastard
that killed Charlotte.

284
00:11:50,187 --> 00:11:52,276
Good luck.

285
00:11:54,104 --> 00:11:56,324
The improv's paying off.

286
00:11:56,367 --> 00:11:58,848
Admirable work, Daniel.

287
00:11:58,892 --> 00:12:00,154
DAN:
For whatever good it does.

288
00:12:00,197 --> 00:12:01,590
If we don't arrest
Pierce's fall guy,

289
00:12:01,633 --> 00:12:03,418
he's gonna know we're onto him.

290
00:12:03,461 --> 00:12:07,204
But if we do, then we lose
the time that we need

291
00:12:07,248 --> 00:12:09,467
to prove that Pierce is really
the one who did it.

292
00:12:09,511 --> 00:12:10,686
Maybe not.

293
00:12:25,701 --> 00:12:27,747
Think Pierce has gone back
to his Sinnerman network?

294
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,792
LUCIFER:
It makes sense. Pierce
needs to move quickly,

295
00:12:29,836 --> 00:12:31,272
and there are thousands
of people in Los Angeles

296
00:12:31,315 --> 00:12:32,926
that owe him a favor.

297
00:12:32,969 --> 00:12:34,405
Well, maybe one of them is
in Chamberlain's orbit.

298
00:12:34,449 --> 00:12:36,277
If we can figure out
who owes Pierce the favor,

299
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,669
maybe we can get him
to flip on him.

300
00:12:37,713 --> 00:12:39,019
It's a long shot, but...

301
00:12:39,062 --> 00:12:41,412
Yeah, but it's the best
one we got so far, so...

302
00:12:41,456 --> 00:12:43,066
[sighs]
Yeah.

303
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:58,081
I told you not to park
under that tree.

304
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,822
You need to
clean this crap.

305
00:12:59,866 --> 00:13:01,911
LAPD.

306
00:13:01,955 --> 00:13:04,174
Want to ask you some questions
about Charlotte Richards.

307
00:13:04,218 --> 00:13:05,567
Yeah, sure.

308
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,264
Can we take this inside?

309
00:13:07,308 --> 00:13:08,788
Nosy neighbors and all that.

310
00:13:12,487 --> 00:13:13,836
CHAMBERLAIN: Not sure
why you came all this way.

311
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,230
I'm not answering any questions
without my lawyer.

312
00:13:16,273 --> 00:13:18,667
We're not here about
the embezzling case.

313
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:21,235
Charlotte Richards
was murdered.

314
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:23,759
What?

315
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,022
Yeah. And your DNA was found
at the scene of the crime.

316
00:13:26,066 --> 00:13:28,895
I didn't murder her.

317
00:13:28,938 --> 00:13:30,548
We know.You got to listen to me.

318
00:13:30,592 --> 00:13:32,812
I... You do?

319
00:13:32,855 --> 00:13:34,552
You see, we think
you're being framed.

320
00:13:34,596 --> 00:13:35,858
And we'd like your help
in trying

321
00:13:35,902 --> 00:13:37,164
to find out who framed you.

322
00:13:37,207 --> 00:13:38,774
Is this some weird
reverse psychology?

323
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:39,862
What's your angle?

324
00:13:39,906 --> 00:13:42,517
Never mind.
I'm calling my lawyer.

325
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,388
If you do that,
we can't help you.

326
00:13:44,432 --> 00:13:47,391
Sorry, but this good cop,
bad cop, sad cop thing

327
00:13:47,435 --> 00:13:48,871
isn't working on me.

328
00:13:48,915 --> 00:13:50,873
Besides, a cigarette butt
is pretty flimsy evidence.

329
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:53,528
He's right. A good frame job
would need more.

330
00:13:53,571 --> 00:13:55,095
Like the murder weapon.

331
00:13:55,138 --> 00:13:56,661
Where would you hide it?CHAMBERLAIN: Nowhere,

332
00:13:56,705 --> 00:13:58,098
because I didn't murder her.

333
00:13:58,141 --> 00:14:00,056
If you did,
where would you hide the gun?

334
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,884
In my desk.What, that one?

335
00:14:01,928 --> 00:14:04,060
I don't-- yes.
That one.

336
00:14:04,104 --> 00:14:06,976
You know, it's not gonna
be there, because I'm not a...

337
00:14:09,109 --> 00:14:12,460
...murderer. W-Whoa.
That is not mine.

338
00:14:12,503 --> 00:14:14,418
For the last time, we know.

339
00:14:14,462 --> 00:14:15,855
CHLOE: Someone planted
this gun here.

340
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:17,247
We need to know who had access

341
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,814
to this area
in the last 12 hours.

342
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,033
Oh, no.LUCIFER: What?

343
00:14:20,076 --> 00:14:22,035
Had a few friends over today,
have you?

344
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:24,559
Oh, just a hundred or so.

345
00:14:24,602 --> 00:14:26,213
[indistinct chatter]

346
00:14:30,347 --> 00:14:32,828
I think we made a real
breakthrough today, Simon.

347
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:33,960
[stammers] Thanks.

348
00:14:34,003 --> 00:14:36,049
A-And I know you're right,
Linda.

349
00:14:36,092 --> 00:14:38,225
Not everyone's
out to get me.

350
00:14:38,268 --> 00:14:40,401
Yeah. Okay. Good.

[gasping]

353
00:14:43,752 --> 00:14:46,668
Are you here
to kill her?
No, no!

354
00:14:46,711 --> 00:14:49,671
That's exactly what someone
trying to kill her would say.

355
00:14:49,714 --> 00:14:50,933
[crying]:
No. No, I...

356
00:14:50,977 --> 00:14:52,065
Maze, he's a patient.

See you next week?

00:15:00,116 --> 00:15:01,422
What the hell happened?!

360
00:15:01,465 --> 00:15:03,206
Are you okay?

361
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,121
Yes! I'm fine.

362
00:15:05,165 --> 00:15:06,775
Good.

363
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,478
All right, we need to figure out

364
00:15:14,522 --> 00:15:15,958
who would get a favor
from The Sinnerman.

365
00:15:16,002 --> 00:15:17,003
Well, you did bring along
your own master of favors.

366
00:15:17,046 --> 00:15:18,308
I could suss out
who needed one the most.

367
00:15:18,352 --> 00:15:20,745
Dude, we don't have time
to go person to person.

368
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:23,705
Pierce is gonna start wondering
where we are soon.

369
00:15:23,748 --> 00:15:24,836
CHLOE:
Yeah, you're right.

370
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,229
We need to narrow down
the list fast.

371
00:15:26,273 --> 00:15:27,448
You know everybody here.

372
00:15:27,491 --> 00:15:29,493
I mean, who would
have a dark secret

373
00:15:29,537 --> 00:15:30,581
that they would
want erased?

374
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,496
Uh, everyone.

375
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,845
What? It's a charity event.

376
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:35,717
LUCIFER: Ah, charity
is the perfect way

377
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,979
for criminals to launder
their images.

378
00:15:37,023 --> 00:15:38,067
Donate a thousand dollars
to distract

379
00:15:38,111 --> 00:15:39,068
from the million
you just filched.

380
00:15:39,112 --> 00:15:40,983
CHAMBERLAIN:
He's not wrong.

381
00:15:41,027 --> 00:15:43,507
That guy.
Sweatshop abuse.

382
00:15:43,551 --> 00:15:46,771
Him? Insider trading.

383
00:15:46,815 --> 00:15:49,600
Her? Stole the idea for
a company from her own sister.

384
00:15:49,644 --> 00:15:51,211
So it could be anyone.

385
00:15:51,254 --> 00:15:52,995
Everyone here is guilty.

386
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:54,736
Which means The Sinnerman's
not very good at what he does.

387
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:57,652
Should've left it to
the professionals, namely moi.

388
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,523
Y-You're right.Well, thank you.

389
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:01,395
No, I mean he is good
at what he does.

390
00:16:01,438 --> 00:16:02,744
If somebody made a deal
with The Sinnerman,

391
00:16:02,787 --> 00:16:04,311
he's gonna make
their skeletons vanish.

392
00:16:04,354 --> 00:16:05,965
And no one would know
about their crimes at all.

393
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:08,097
Which means we're not
looking for a criminal.

394
00:16:08,141 --> 00:16:11,448
We're looking for somebody
as clean as can be.

395
00:16:11,492 --> 00:16:14,974
Dan.

396
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:17,411
Dan.

397
00:16:17,454 --> 00:16:20,283
Who hired you
to frame your boss?

398
00:16:20,327 --> 00:16:21,850
What? What are you
talking about?

399
00:16:21,893 --> 00:16:23,156
Dan.You are innocent.

400
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,679
And that's a bad thing?

401
00:16:24,722 --> 00:16:26,855
You're the only one who has
access to Chamberlain's office

402
00:16:26,898 --> 00:16:28,509
and the only one
with no dirty laundry.

403
00:16:28,552 --> 00:16:30,728
Now, the woman I loved is dead,
so if you don't start talking...

404
00:16:30,772 --> 00:16:31,729
Daniel, Daniel!
Daniel, Daniel.

405
00:16:31,773 --> 00:16:33,775
I understand your anger,

406
00:16:33,818 --> 00:16:34,863
but perhaps a lighter touch

407
00:16:34,906 --> 00:16:36,908
might help reveal
the truth faster.

408
00:16:36,952 --> 00:16:38,910
I mean, after all, this
young man did ask for a favor

409
00:16:38,954 --> 00:16:40,390
from The Sinnerman,

410
00:16:40,434 --> 00:16:43,219
so you must've wanted something
very badly, didn't you?

411
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:45,134
Yeah. Tell me.

412
00:16:45,178 --> 00:16:46,962
What is it you desired?

413
00:16:48,485 --> 00:16:50,618
I wished I never sneezed.

414
00:16:50,661 --> 00:16:52,968
You interrupted me
for a stupid parlor trick?

415
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,014
Dan, it's not a trick.

416
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:56,972
I-I don't know what
it is, but it works.

417
00:16:58,191 --> 00:16:59,496
Calm down.

418
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,802
What happened
when you sneezed?

419
00:17:00,845 --> 00:17:04,066
I...

420
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:06,590
I took my eyes off the road
for a second.

421
00:17:06,634 --> 00:17:09,680
And... this...

422
00:17:09,724 --> 00:17:11,117
this motorcycle
pulled in front of me

423
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,248
at just the wrong time.

424
00:17:12,292 --> 00:17:14,033
So you killed a biker

425
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:16,078
and then found somebody
who could make it all disappear.

426
00:17:16,122 --> 00:17:20,039
[stammers] I heard about a guy
who gave out favors,

427
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:21,301
so I called him.

428
00:17:21,344 --> 00:17:23,042
And the next morning I...

429
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:24,826
it was like it
never happened.

430
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:26,175
But it did happen.

431
00:17:26,219 --> 00:17:27,698
No matter how much time
has passed,

432
00:17:27,742 --> 00:17:29,831
every time I look in the mirror,
all I see is...

433
00:17:29,874 --> 00:17:31,180
A monster.

434
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:33,922
DAN:
And then this morning

435
00:17:33,965 --> 00:17:35,315
he called in his favor.

436
00:17:36,664 --> 00:17:38,100
How'd he contact you?
Would you recognize him?

437
00:17:38,144 --> 00:17:39,536
I never saw anybody.

438
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:42,104
A burner phone showed up
at my doorstep this morning

439
00:17:42,148 --> 00:17:44,802
and everything after was handled
through dead drops.

440
00:17:44,846 --> 00:17:46,369
All right.
We're gonna need that phone.

441
00:17:46,413 --> 00:17:48,197
Okay.

442
00:17:48,241 --> 00:17:51,418
We're running out of time.

443
00:17:51,461 --> 00:17:53,550
Okay, so then we buy more.
We bring Chamberlain in.

444
00:17:53,594 --> 00:17:55,900
We let him lawyer up
so he doesn't talk.

445
00:17:55,944 --> 00:17:57,728
CHLOE: And then what?
Pierce works with the pros.

446
00:17:57,772 --> 00:17:59,600
There's a good chance there's
no evidence on the burner phone.

447
00:17:59,643 --> 00:18:02,081
Well, perhaps it's time
we asked for some help.

448
00:18:10,393 --> 00:18:13,657
Hey. I got your
text. What's up?

449
00:18:15,703 --> 00:18:17,705
I need something from you.

450
00:18:17,748 --> 00:18:20,447
Of course you do.

451
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:21,883
I do, too, actually.

452
00:18:21,926 --> 00:18:23,537
That's not what I meant. I...

453
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,365
Hey. Hey.

454
00:18:25,408 --> 00:18:27,541
You have been
through so much.

455
00:18:27,584 --> 00:18:30,413
Okay?

456
00:18:30,457 --> 00:18:32,546
You need to go home.

457
00:18:32,589 --> 00:18:34,243
You need to take
care of you.

458
00:18:35,853 --> 00:18:36,811
We got the guy.

459
00:18:36,854 --> 00:18:39,205
That's just it.
I need you...

460
00:18:39,248 --> 00:18:41,685
[clears throat]
What's up?

461
00:18:47,082 --> 00:18:48,692
I need you
to do me a favor.

462
00:18:50,216 --> 00:18:52,305
Something you can't tell
anyone about.

463
00:19:00,008 --> 00:19:02,184
Lopez, you want to
come in or what?

464
00:19:02,228 --> 00:19:04,882
Uh...

465
00:19:04,926 --> 00:19:06,188
Hey, boss.

466
00:19:06,232 --> 00:19:08,190
What is it?

467
00:19:08,234 --> 00:19:11,541
Dan gave something to me.

468
00:19:11,585 --> 00:19:14,240
Asked me to examine it,

469
00:19:14,283 --> 00:19:16,633
but told me not to tell anyone.

470
00:19:16,677 --> 00:19:17,982
What is it?

471
00:19:18,026 --> 00:19:20,811
A phone?

472
00:19:20,855 --> 00:19:22,378
That's it?

473
00:19:22,422 --> 00:19:24,989
Yeah. I mean, he...
honestly, he sounded

474
00:19:25,033 --> 00:19:26,121
kind of crazy.

475
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,818
He was going on and on

476
00:19:27,862 --> 00:19:30,691
about some frame job
or something.

477
00:19:30,734 --> 00:19:33,084
Huh. Well, what all did he say?

478
00:19:33,128 --> 00:19:34,434
Uh, not much more than that.

479
00:19:34,477 --> 00:19:37,219
He-he claimed that
"people might be listening."

480
00:19:37,263 --> 00:19:39,047
I know, it sounds insane.

481
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,962
I-I know he's not
in a great place.

482
00:19:41,005 --> 00:19:44,052
I told him he should just
go home and get some sleep.

483
00:19:44,095 --> 00:19:46,228
I'm-I'm really worried
about him.

484
00:19:46,272 --> 00:19:48,448
It's okay. I'm glad you came
to me with this, Ella.

485
00:19:48,491 --> 00:19:51,538
But I don't want Dan
to get into any trouble.

486
00:19:51,581 --> 00:19:54,584
He's not in any trouble.
I promise.

487
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,022
Okay.

488
00:20:04,812 --> 00:20:06,248
Yeah, it's me.

489
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:08,076
One of my officers is on to you.

490
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:09,556
I don't need excuses.

491
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,166
I just need you
to take care of it.

492
00:20:28,662 --> 00:20:30,664
♪

493
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,335
Hello, Pierce.

494
00:20:49,378 --> 00:20:51,380
It's time for a reckoning.

495
00:20:51,424 --> 00:20:52,773
What are you talking about?

496
00:20:52,816 --> 00:20:54,427
I know you killed Charlotte.

497
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,435
So, why'd you do it, Piercy?

498
00:21:02,478 --> 00:21:04,611
Why kill Charlotte?

499
00:21:04,654 --> 00:21:06,395
I don't know what
this is about, Lucifer.

500
00:21:06,439 --> 00:21:08,528
We caught the murderer.
I don't know why you think...

501
00:21:08,571 --> 00:21:10,921
The detective isn't here,
which means

502
00:21:10,965 --> 00:21:14,925
I'm invulnerable
and you're not, so...

503
00:21:14,969 --> 00:21:18,973
sit...

504
00:21:19,016 --> 00:21:21,149
down.

505
00:21:21,192 --> 00:21:23,673
Or I'll make you.

506
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:33,248
[sighs] Lucifer...

507
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,120
For every lie,
I will break a body part.

508
00:21:36,164 --> 00:21:38,253
I didn't mean to kill Charlotte.

509
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,472
It was an accident.

510
00:21:39,515 --> 00:21:41,082
I was trying to kill Amenadiel.

511
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,649
And that's supposed to spare
your life, is it?

512
00:21:42,692 --> 00:21:44,607
You wanted by brother
dead instead?

513
00:21:44,651 --> 00:21:45,869
It's the truth.

514
00:21:45,913 --> 00:21:47,218
But why?

515
00:21:49,395 --> 00:21:50,831
God took my mark away.

516
00:21:50,874 --> 00:21:53,007
I thought killing his favorite
son might bring it back.

517
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:56,184
[laughing]

518
00:21:56,227 --> 00:21:58,186
Did you, now?

519
00:21:58,229 --> 00:21:59,840
[chuckles]

520
00:21:59,883 --> 00:22:03,452
You know, when I first
landed in Hell...

521
00:22:05,628 --> 00:22:09,197
...I'd just led a rebellion
against dear old Dad.

522
00:22:10,981 --> 00:22:11,982
I failed.

523
00:22:12,026 --> 00:22:14,724
Everyone hated me for it.

524
00:22:14,768 --> 00:22:19,033
Myself included,
I've come to realize.

525
00:22:19,076 --> 00:22:21,862
I felt like a monster.

526
00:22:21,905 --> 00:22:24,995
And then, when I looked
at my reflection,

527
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,562
there was my Devil face.

528
00:22:26,606 --> 00:22:28,477
Your Father's punishment.

529
00:22:28,521 --> 00:22:30,784
So I thought, but...

530
00:22:30,827 --> 00:22:32,525
[chuckles]

531
00:22:32,568 --> 00:22:35,615
after speaking with a sneezy,
murderous driver today,

532
00:22:35,658 --> 00:22:38,618
I realized
I felt like a monster

533
00:22:38,661 --> 00:22:40,576
before I became one.

534
00:22:43,449 --> 00:22:46,582
I think I gave myself that face.

535
00:22:46,626 --> 00:22:48,628
[laughing]

536
00:22:50,891 --> 00:22:54,068
