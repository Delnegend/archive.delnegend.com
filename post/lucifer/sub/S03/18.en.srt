1
00:00:01,202 --> 00:00:03,471
Previously on Lucifer...
Mama's gone?

2
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:04,405
Yes. I mean, she says

3
00:00:04,438 --> 00:00:06,640
good-bye forever.
She loves you very much.

4
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:07,808
I'm missing time.

5
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,377
It's like someone else

6
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:10,711
was living my life.

7
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:12,580
The one man I've cared about--

8
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:14,182
I still gave him up.

9
00:00:14,215 --> 00:00:15,783
That's how much I care
about our friendship.

10
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:17,551
Go... to...

11
00:00:17,585 --> 00:00:18,586
Hell.

12
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:19,653
In the surveillance van,

13
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:21,089
when I asked you
to stay in L.A.,

14
00:00:21,122 --> 00:00:22,490
we did have a moment there.

15
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:23,791
Which is why I had
to tell you that I'm not

16
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:25,459
relationship material.

17
00:00:25,493 --> 00:00:27,295
You're terrified of letting
someone get close to you

18
00:00:27,328 --> 00:00:28,629
'cause you know they'll
eventually leave you.

19
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:30,598
You'll outlive them.
You got to have faith,

20
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:32,333
because life can surprise you.

21
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,402
Now, if my brother, the Devil,
can have that...

22
00:00:34,435 --> 00:00:35,569
Maybe I can, too.

23
00:00:38,206 --> 00:00:40,308
(upbeat jazz piano playing)

24
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:47,548
(women laughing)

25
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:49,717
So, what brings
you here?

26
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,052
Work.

27
00:00:54,122 --> 00:00:55,556
What you working on?

28
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:57,191
A case.

29
00:00:57,225 --> 00:00:59,627
Well, you want to take a break
and buy me a drink?

30
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,295
Not really, no.

31
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:03,063
(scoffs)

32
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:13,574
Got to admit.

33
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:15,609
Watching these women trying
to get your attention--

34
00:01:15,643 --> 00:01:16,844
best part of my night.

35
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:18,346
I don't know what I'm gonna do

36
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:20,514
when you finally say yes
to one of them.

37
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:21,682
Never gonna say yes.

38
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:24,552
Oh, yeah? 'Cause somebody
already stole your heart?

39
00:01:26,287 --> 00:01:27,421
(sighs)

40
00:01:27,455 --> 00:01:29,657
It's just not
in the cards for me.

41
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,459
We got to go, Detective.

42
00:01:35,663 --> 00:01:39,400
Um... duty calls.

43
00:01:40,468 --> 00:01:41,702
All right.

44
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:44,205
("Love is Strange"
by Mickey & Silvia begins)

45
00:01:46,174 --> 00:01:48,809
* Love...

46
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:53,447
Two more bodies were just found
in Griffith Park holding hands.

47
00:01:53,481 --> 00:01:55,549
Looks like the Broken Hearts
Killer strikes again.

48
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:57,151
Stop calling him that.

49
00:01:57,185 --> 00:01:58,519
Why? What's the problem?

50
00:01:58,552 --> 00:01:59,520
Because you never know

51
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:01,789
when something stupid
like that's gonna stick.

52
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:03,524
Come on. That'll never stick.

53
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:04,658
(chuckles)

54
00:02:04,692 --> 00:02:06,160
(camera shutter clicks)

55
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:10,931
(footsteps approaching,
Chloe sighs)

56
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,301
Wow. Last night was so...

57
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:15,203
That was quite
the concert.
Yes!

58
00:02:15,236 --> 00:02:16,437
I can't remember the last time

59
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,771
I went to a show
that was so, uh...

60
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:20,774
Loud.
So loud! I still
can't hear anything.

61
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:23,344
ELLA:
They totally boned.

62
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:25,846
(scoffs)
Miss Lopez, please
don't be vulgar.

63
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,615
The detective
doesn't... bone.

64
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:31,485
Seriously, do you not
see the epic fireworks?

65
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,587
There's more chemistry
over there than in my lab.

66
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:35,823
And they just went to
the Axara concert.

67
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:37,658
It's a natural aphrodisiac.

68
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:39,860
Well, if you're a pimply
millennial, perhaps,

69
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,729
but the detective
is a grown woman

70
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:42,963
with sophisticated tastes.

71
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,766
Trust me, she's not
so easily won over.

72
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:48,369
Oh, my God.

73
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:50,538
You are totally
freaking out right now.

74
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:51,705
What?

75
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:54,275
About this coming
between you and Chloe.

76
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:55,976
Don't be preposterous.

77
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,346
I'm not freaking out
about anything.

78
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,848
It's okay. Okay, I-I get it.

79
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:02,916
You're afraid that

80
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,486
they're gonna start spending
all their time together.

81
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,289
You know, joining each
other at crime scenes,

82
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:09,657
bantering over
dead bodies.

83
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,592
And where does that
leave you, right?

84
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,362
I assure you, Miss Lopez,
that is the least of my worries.

85
00:03:14,395 --> 00:03:16,697
The chemistry in
there is just a...

86
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:17,865
a flash in the pan.

87
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:19,233
Exactly.
Mm.

88
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:21,835
A completely hot
flash in the pan.

89
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:27,775
Lucifer, what you and Chloe
have is on a total other level.

90
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:30,478
Exactly. Nothing
is changing.

91
00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:32,513
Nope. Nope.

92
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,415
CHLOE:
Anyhow, I just...

93
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:36,350
I wanted
to say thank you for coming.

94
00:03:36,384 --> 00:03:38,018
I just...
I had a really great time.

95
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,321
So when can we do it again?

96
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:42,323
Um... uh...

97
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:43,557
a con... a concert, or...?

98
00:03:43,591 --> 00:03:45,859
I was thinking
something quieter.

99
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:47,895
Maybe dinner?

100
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:49,897
I know a pretty good Italian
place if you're into that.

101
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:54,034
Uh, I mean, I love... Italian,

102
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,769
but, uh,

103
00:03:55,803 --> 00:03:57,405
weren't you saying
that you didn't want to...?

104
00:03:57,438 --> 00:03:58,806
Hey, Chloe, I just
wanted to, uh...

105
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,408
I'm sorry.

106
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:01,709
I didn't mean
to interrupt.

107
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,711
My bad.
CHLOE:
No, no. You're good.

108
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:04,878
We were just, um...

109
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,414
(chuckles)
Just...

110
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,783
What's up?

111
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:11,985
Well, uh, we have a case--
double murder.

112
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:13,487
Some couple found
in a convertible

113
00:04:13,521 --> 00:04:14,788
at a lookout off Griffith Park.

114
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:16,690
Super creepy scene,
by the sounds of it.

115
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:18,692
Mm-hmm. Okay,
I'll be right there.

116
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:21,362
Espinoza, could I get
a copy of that file?

117
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:22,663
Sure thing.

118
00:04:28,536 --> 00:04:29,670
*

119
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:33,006
* Love's gone away. *

120
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,876
What would I like?

121
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,711
Well...

122
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:41,682
sometimes the answer
to that is not so simple, is it?

123
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:45,386
I mean, I would like to know
what my father's next test is.

124
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,855
I feel pretty confident
that I passed the last one,

125
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:51,492
but... what's next?

126
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:53,594
And what am I supposed
to do in between?

127
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,963
Or is that, in itself,
a test?

128
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:57,965
Okay.

129
00:04:57,998 --> 00:05:00,868
How about a large mocha
with extra whip?

130
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:02,936
Sure. Sure.

131
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,572
Okay.
Okay.

132
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:06,874
Large Americano
for Charlotte.

133
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:15,849
Mom? Mom?!

134
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:18,486
I can't believe
it's you.

135
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,721
Uh, Lucifer said
that you were gone,

136
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:23,123
that-that he used
the Flaming Sword

137
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,726
and sent you into
another universe.

138
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:28,929
What are you doing back here?

139
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:31,699
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

140
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,735
Uh...

141
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:36,537
no.

142
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,938
No, you don't.

143
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:39,540
I, um... I'm sorry.

144
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:40,941
I thought you were
someone else.

145
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:43,711
No, wait.
You know Lucifer,

146
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:45,779
so you do know me.

147
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:48,782
What did you mean,
a "Flaming Sword"?

148
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:51,885
I'm really sorry,
but I have to go.

149
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:59,860
LUCIFER:
For the record, Detective,
I'd like you to note

150
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:02,596
that I haven't once asked you
about your evening with Pierce.

151
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,164
I realize
it's none of my business.

152
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,666
You're right. It's not.

153
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,401
But Miss Lopez thinks
you boned.

154
00:06:07,435 --> 00:06:08,502
What?
(clears throat)

155
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:09,670
Her words, not mine.

156
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,605
I, uh, simply thought
you should know.

157
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,507
We just went
to a concert, you know?

158
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:14,808
It's not a big deal.

159
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:16,444
Right. That's what
Dr. Linda said, too.

160
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:18,078
Well, for having this
not be your business,

161
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,947
you're certainly talking
to a lot of people about it.

162
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,949
I know. I just wish
people would stop prying.

163
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:23,817
But regardless, I've
come to the conclusion

164
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:25,786
that no matter what happens
with you and Pierce,

165
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:27,455
you and I are
partners, Detective,

166
00:06:27,488 --> 00:06:28,956
and nothing can
come between that.

167
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:30,491
Prepare yourselves, people.

168
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:33,961
This is a different
kind of case.

169
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,669
*

170
00:06:48,476 --> 00:06:50,711
CHLOE: Lieutenant,
what brings you here?

171
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,112
I had a gut feeling
about this case.

172
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:54,014
I wanted to see
if I was right.

173
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:56,183
As much as we appreciate your
digestive feelings, Lieutenant,

174
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:58,819
the detective and I have this
utterly under control,

175
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:01,021
so, if you don't mind...
I don't mind at all.

176
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:02,923
(garbled radio transmission)

177
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:05,025
Ella, what do we have?

178
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:08,061
Meet Robbie Matthews
and Rachel White.

179
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,130
Looks like they were
drugged unconscious,

180
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,733
and then someone literally
smashed their chests in.

181
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,535
Do we know
how they were drugged?

182
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:16,770
Uh, best guess, maybe the killer
used some form of anesthetic.

183
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:18,138
Liquid or aerosol.

184
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,608
And then crushed their ribs,
their sternum.

185
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:22,510
LUCIFER:
And finally, their hearts.

186
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:24,645
Well, it's not hard to figure
out what the desire was here.

187
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:26,580
Well, the killer was clearly
trying to send a message.

188
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:28,749
That he couldn't stand
this couple's relationship.

189
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:29,950
So, what?

190
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:31,752
We think maybe
she had a jealous stalker?

191
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,887
Or an angry ex.
We need to talk to anyone

192
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:35,556
who had a problem
with this relationship.

193
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:36,757
See, we've got this,
Lieutenant.

194
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,058
No need to mess
with success.

195
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:39,927
Which one of them was married?

196
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,697
Well, no weddings rings, so,
neither of them, obviously.

197
00:07:43,731 --> 00:07:45,833
But good on you
for participating.

198
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:47,768
Has anyone checked their
chest cavities yet?

199
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,503
What? Why would we do that?

200
00:07:49,537 --> 00:07:51,905
In the '50s, there was
a guy named Clark Hoffman.

201
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:53,541
He was known for
making his victims

202
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:54,775
swallow their wedding rings.

203
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,109
Right, the Broken Hearts Killer.

204
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,778
PIERCE:
By the time they caught him,

205
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,179
he'd killed seven
cheating couples in L.A.

206
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,849
His crime scenes were
about as gruesome as this.

207
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:03,250
Wow, you really know
a lot about this.

208
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:04,785
The cop who solved
the case

209
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,253
was an old mentor of mine.

210
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:09,523
And didn't Hoffman die
a few days ago in prison?

211
00:08:09,557 --> 00:08:11,559
Making him a particularly
useless addition

212
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:12,793
to this conversation.

213
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,628
Unless his death
inspired a copycat.

214
00:08:14,662 --> 00:08:17,064
Or maybe they're using this
as an MO to throw us off.

215
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:18,566
Thank you.

216
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:21,001
I hope that's all it is.
ELLA:
All righty,

217
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,970
guess we'll get out
the old chest spreader

218
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,805
and go fishing
for some wedding rings.

219
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:28,208
Or, according to their
social media profile,

220
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,744
Rachel was single,
and Robbie was married.

221
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:32,680
We need to talk
to the spouse ASAP.

222
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:34,815
(indistinct radio chatter)

223
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,850
Yep. (sighs)
Don't worry.

224
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:39,086
Nothing's changing.

225
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:41,689
Nothing at all.
Hmm.

226
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:44,725
Okay, Monkey,
you grab the backpack,

227
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:46,093
I'll grab the... brownies,

228
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:48,562
and we'll get you to school.

229
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:51,965
Maze, are you home?

230
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:53,300
(snoring softly)
Hey...

231
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,602
BEATRICE:
Daddy...

232
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:57,204
there's a man
in my bed.
What?

233
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:59,707
And he smells bad.

234
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:03,076
(yawning, moaning)

235
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:05,946
I see you found the band.

236
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:08,882
Go wait in the car.

237
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,317
Seriously,
what were you thinking

238
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,920
letting a drunken rocker
sleep in Trixie's bed?

239
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:15,355
I was thinking
he was too drunk

240
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,658
to make it up the stairs
to Chloe's bed.

241
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:18,826
What's the big deal?

242
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:20,093
The big deal, Maze,

243
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,895
is that you live
with a nine-year-old.

244
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:23,697
It's not okay.

245
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:26,834
Ooh... did I make Dan mad?

246
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:29,136
Why are you...

247
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:30,938
Are you going through
something lately?

248
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:32,806
Other than the band, no.

249
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,908
Fine.

250
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:36,744
Whatever.
Clean up.

251
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:39,079
I don't want to have to
tell Chloe about this.

252
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:41,281
She has enough
on her plate right now.

253
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:42,683
You know, there
are some things

254
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:44,652
I could tell Chloe, too.

255
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:46,386
(sighs)
Like what?

256
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,821
Like...

257
00:09:47,855 --> 00:09:50,691
remember when we had
a guy killed?

258
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:52,760
Yeah.

259
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:54,327
That was fun.

260
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:58,131
Seems we both have things
we'd rather Chloe not know.

261
00:09:58,165 --> 00:10:03,070
Look, I don't know what's
going on with you right now,

262
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:06,273
but whatever it is...
figure it out.

263
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:13,647
Emma Mathews just
got brought in.

264
00:10:13,681 --> 00:10:15,115
And Emma Matthews is...

265
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:16,216
The victim's wife.

266
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:17,818
Right.
Yes, of course.

267
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:19,953
Well, mustn't keep the
murderous lady waiting.

268
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:21,221
Mind if I join?

269
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:23,757
You sure?
You don't have to.

270
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,058
I know.
I want to.

271
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:27,961
Great.
The more the merrier.

272
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:30,664
Uh... I know what
you're doing.

273
00:10:30,698 --> 00:10:32,199
I'm getting ready to
question a suspect.

274
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:33,433
And I hate to break it
to you, Kane,

275
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,835
but there's only
room for one immortal

276
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:36,303
in the detective's life,

277
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:38,271
and that position's
already been filled.
By you.

278
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:41,408
The detective and I are a team--
a package deal, if you will.

279
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:43,977
Sadly, there's just no room
for a third.

280
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:45,445
And I don't understand why

281
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,247
you're trying to spend time
with her anyway.

282
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,849
What happened to the whole
wanting to die thing?

283
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:49,983
I had a change of heart.

284
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:51,284
I'm sorry if I upset you.

285
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:52,820
I didn't think you two
were a thing.

286
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:53,921
We're not a thing.

287
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:55,455
We're partners.

288
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,024
Well, if that's all it is,
then you've got nothing

289
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:58,091
to worry about, do you?

290
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,393
(stammers):
Wait...

291
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:01,929
Right.

292
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:03,396
Yeah.

293
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:06,934
(grunts)

294
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:09,069
Fine, fine.

295
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:11,371
I prefer standing anyway.

296
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:12,372
CHLOE:
Emma,

297
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,742
four months ago, your
husband reported that

298
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:17,144
you slashed his tires.
Then two months ago,

299
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:20,113
neighbors saw you throwing
rocks through his window.

300
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:21,749
And then just last month,

301
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:23,884
you were seen threatening
him with a bat.

302
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:25,185
Can you explain that?

303
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:31,124
Look, I'm not proud
of what happened.

304
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:32,760
But I was upset.

305
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:35,729
I just found out
Robbie was cheating on me.

306
00:11:35,763 --> 00:11:37,030
Well, completely understandable.

307
00:11:37,064 --> 00:11:38,732
I mean, what else
are you supposed to do

308
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:41,802
when some parasite inserts
himself into your relationship?

309
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:44,237
So is that why you did this?

310
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:46,406
What?
(inhales sharply)

311
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:47,808
Is this for real?

312
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:53,213
I... admit I hated Rachel,

313
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:55,215
but I would never hurt Robbie.

314
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:57,450
I-I may have gone
a little nuts

315
00:11:57,484 --> 00:11:59,352
when I learned
he was cheating, but...

316
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,922
after the courts forced me
into therapy,

317
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:03,791
we started talking.

318
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:05,926
We chose to divorce amicably.

319
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:08,195
Oh, God.

320
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,262
I can't believe he's dead.

321
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:10,463
This is preposterous.

322
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:12,265
Do you really
expect us to believe

323
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:15,335
that you were okay with someone
tearing you two apart?

324
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:17,037
It's the truth.
Does the name

325
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,807
Clark Hoffman
mean anything to you?

326
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,374
Who?
(shuddering breath)

327
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,310
I know we're gonna check out
her alibi,

328
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:24,978
but my gut tells me
to believe her.

329
00:12:25,012 --> 00:12:26,980
Oh, please. Just 'cause
she spouted some drivel

330
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:28,448
about conscious uncoupling?

331
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,483
Because she has no idea
who the Broken Hearts Killer is

332
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:32,285
and she has no motive
to go after Robbie.

333
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:33,787
Well, she's
obviously lying,

334
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:35,455
about her relationships
and the murders.

335
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,190
Please tell me I'm not
the only one who sees that.

336
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:38,525
Detective?
I think we can't take

337
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:41,128
Emma's word at face value.
Mm-hmm.

338
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:42,395
DAN: We don't have to.
Another couple

339
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:43,997
was just found dead
holding hands.

340
00:12:44,031 --> 00:12:45,165
This time
at a cheap motel.

341
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:46,800
The Safari Inn.

342
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:49,402
(sighs) This isn't just
a lovers' quarrel.

343
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,138
No, you're right.

344
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:52,539
The copycat's
just getting started.

345
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:54,174
Lieutenant, we need you
on this case.

346
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:55,909
(stammers, sighs)

347
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,512
And I normally love threesomes.

348
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:07,054
(indistinct chatter)

349
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:12,926
Meet Mary Lee
and Dennis Horn.

350
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,295
Just like our first lovers,
they were drugged unconscious

351
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:17,564
before the killer took something
really big and really hard

352
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:18,932
and literally...

353
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:20,500
Bludgeoned their hearts.
Mm-hmm.

354
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,270
And then moved them here
and staged this whole scene.

355
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,973
And just like the other victims,
one of them's married.

356
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:27,540
She's got a tan line
on her ring finger.

357
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:29,042
ELLA: We actually
ended up finding

358
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:30,443
a wedding ring inside
the first victim,

359
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:33,446
so good bet we'll
probably find one here, too.

360
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,948
Any other evidence?

361
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:36,449
ELLA: More like
lack thereof.

362
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:37,985
Place was wiped clean,

363
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:39,186
just like the
first crime scene.

364
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:40,921
I mean, this
killer, you guys,

365
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:43,556
whoever he--
or she-- is,

366
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,858
total pro.

367
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:46,293
Well, Emma's alibi checks out.

368
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,461
There's no obvious connection
between the couples.

369
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:51,031
I just wonder how the killer's
picking his targets.

370
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:52,565
Well, Lieutenant,

371
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:54,501
as our resident
Broken Hearts expert,

372
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:57,070
wouldn't you say it's time to
enlighten us with your wisdom?

373
00:13:57,104 --> 00:14:00,140
No one knew how the original
killer chose his victims.

374
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,409
I guess we just got lucky
we caught him when we did.

375
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:03,510
"We"?

376
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:05,245
The LAPD.

377
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:07,214
CHLOE: We don't have time
for luck. We got to get back

378
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:08,615
to the station,
figure out a connection

379
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:10,117
between these victims.

380
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,384
Yes, I couldn't agree more,
Detective.

381
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:13,220
After all,
the sooner we finish this case,

382
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:16,356
the sooner things
can all go back to normal.

383
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:19,359
Oof.

384
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:22,029
Gnarly.

385
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:25,432
(camera shutter clicks)

386
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:27,400
(easy jazz piano playing)

387
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:34,541
WOMAN: You're
burning my table.

388
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:35,608
Hmm?

389
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:38,111
Oh, I'm sorry.

390
00:14:38,145 --> 00:14:39,179
Um...

391
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:42,049
You don't ever take
a moment to stop, do you?

392
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:43,984
No rest for the wicked,

393
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:46,153
so no rest for me, either.

394
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:51,658
I've got you
figured out, you know.

395
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:52,993
You do, huh?

396
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:54,694
You could work anywhere--

397
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,296
your office, your home,

398
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:58,265
but you choose
to work in this bar.

399
00:14:58,298 --> 00:14:59,432
Why?

400
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:01,034
I like a stiff drink?

401
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:03,670
Because you don't actually
want to be alone.

402
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:05,538
Then why do I sit by myself?

403
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,941
Maybe you feel like you
don't deserve the company.

404
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:10,543
Well, look who's
a detective now.

405
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:13,113
(chuckles)

406
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:14,681
So, what are you
spending all these

407
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:16,283
lonesome hours on, anyway?

408
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:17,450
I'm working on trying
to find the guy

409
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:18,952
who kills cheating couples.

410
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:20,587
The Broken Hearts Killer?

411
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,322
That's what they call him.

412
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:25,192
Six crime scenes,
not one shred of evidence.

413
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:27,227
It's like I'm looking
for clues that don't exist.

414
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,229
It never ceases to amaze me,

415
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,964
the lengths people will go to

416
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:32,399
when they want to make
something just right.

417
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,567
What do you mean?

418
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,703
Like when people
come into the bar

419
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:38,171
for a special occasion,

420
00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:40,673
like a birthday
or a proposal.

421
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:42,442
Sometimes they'll come
in here days ahead of time

422
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:44,211
just to make sure
everything's perfect.

423
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:47,280
Maybe it's the same for

424
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:49,316
whoever this Broken
Hearts guy is.

425
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:53,720
All right, Lieutenant,
what did you want to show us?
I may have a lead.

426
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:55,722
Ah, did you find it
during A.V. Club?

427
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:57,324
We already know
the killer disabled

428
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:58,992
the hotel's
surveillance cameras.

429
00:15:59,026 --> 00:16:00,393
On the day
of the murders, yes,

430
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:02,462
but then I started thinking
what if the killer

431
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:04,731
scoped out the location
a week before?

432
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:07,067
And I found this.

433
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,002
CHLOE:
Wait, is that...
Our guy? Maybe.

434
00:16:09,036 --> 00:16:12,772
The car's registered to a Neil
Berger, former schoolteacher.

435
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,342
Well, that's it,
a chap snapping photos?

436
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,144
How do we know
he's not scrapbooking?

437
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:19,212
I put an APB out on him, and...
(phone chimes)

438
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:21,748
We just got a hit.

439
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:23,416
He's been spotted in front
of the original killer's house.

440
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,251
Let's go.

441
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:26,753
We-Well, that's...

442
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:29,289
actually quite promising.

443
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:36,329
(knock at door)

444
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:39,366
Hi.

445
00:16:41,268 --> 00:16:43,236
Listen, I know we're not
exactly speaking right now,

446
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,604
but there's something
that I need to tell you.

447
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:46,273
Okay.

448
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:48,708
Now, don't freak out, but, uh,

449
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,410
Charlotte Richards is back.

450
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:51,511
Oh...

451
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:53,780
But you have absolutely
nothing to worry about, Linda.

452
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:56,416
She's not, uh...
(sighs)

453
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:58,285
You know,
she's not Mom anymore.

454
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:00,587
Wow.

455
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,222
It's really kind of you

456
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:03,790
to come all the way
over here to tell me that.

457
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:08,161
I mean, especially...
when you must be dealing with...

458
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:09,362
such a shock yourself.

459
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:11,598
You knew, didn't you?

460
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:13,833
I may have run into Charlotte

461
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,835
a few times--
I don't know,

462
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,438
maybe... here.

463
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:19,839
You're treating her, Linda?

464
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,841
You didn't think,

465
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,843
just once,

466
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,713
that maybe I had the right
to know that she was alive?

467
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:28,548
I assumed you knew.

468
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:34,087
Well, maybe you can help me.

469
00:17:35,622 --> 00:17:37,490
(camera shutter clicks)
For the last time, man,

470
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:40,227
please, please quit taking
pictures of my house!

471
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,561
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Your house?

472
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:43,363
You're lucky you get
to liv here, okay?

473
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,198
This place should be
a freakin' landmark by now!

474
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:46,599
Do you know who lived here?
A great artist, man.

475
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:47,767
Who are you?!

476
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,202
Seriously, last warning, dude.

477
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:50,470
Next time,
I'm calling the cops.

478
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:51,804
Call the cops.
They'll be on my side.

479
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:53,173
Oh, whatever.

480
00:17:53,206 --> 00:17:55,508
Neil Berger?
Yeah.

481
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:58,478
Wow. Sorry you had
to witness that.

482
00:17:58,511 --> 00:17:59,746
Um, bah.

483
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:01,748
Okay, who's ready?

484
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:03,350
Ready for what?

485
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:05,885
For the wonder that is
the Broken Hearts Tour.

486
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,488
Duh. You guys are
my 3:00, right?

487
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:10,323
Uh-huh.

488
00:18:10,357 --> 00:18:12,225
All right, all right.
Let's get some ponchos on you.

489
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:15,228
When I ran into Charlotte,
I-I-I may have mentioned

490
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:16,729
a few things that
I shouldn't have.

491
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:20,467
But by the time I realized
that she wasn't Mom...

492
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,634
it was too late.

493
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:22,769
Oh, no.

494
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:24,304
You know, she was just
staring at me

495
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:26,573
with these...
these lost eyes,

496
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,375
searching for answers.

497
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:31,411
What are you
asking me, Amenadiel?

498
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:35,248
I think that maybe she
deserves to know the truth.

499
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:36,549
I understand that

500
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:37,484
you miss your mom

501
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:39,352
and that you didn't
get to say good-bye.

502
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:41,721
But Charlotte is a woman
who has literally

503
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:43,623
been to Hell and back.

504
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:45,625
She's fragile.

505
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:48,761
When I found out the truth,
it nearly broke me.

506
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:50,197
And I was stable.

507
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,332
So what are you saying?

508
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:55,402
I'm saying if you really
want to help Charlotte...

509
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:59,372
...you'll stay away.

510
00:18:59,406 --> 00:19:02,442
BERGER:
Originally built in 1909,

511
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,377
Hoffman's iconic
Craftsman home

512
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:06,746
is just blocks away
from what I like to call

513
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:08,715
"The Last Heartbreak"--

514
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:10,250
the scene of the final murder,

515
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:11,651
and where the killer
was ultimately

516
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:13,820
apprehended by police.

517
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:14,954
Why are we wasting our time

518
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,589
with these ridiculous
shenanigans?

519
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:18,425
Let's just grab this
miscreant and be done with it.

520
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,826
Because, unfortunately,
we don't have

521
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:21,528
enough evidence to arrest him.

522
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:23,396
PIERCE: Serial killers love
talking about themselves.

523
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,564
The more Neil talks,
the more likely

524
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:25,932
he'll incriminate himself.

525
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:27,967
I may as well be
speaking to myself.

526
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,502
Uh, I'm listening.

527
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:31,471
CHLOE: Um, excuse me,
uh, Neil, is it?

528
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,840
Yeah. Well, I was wondering
what you thought about

529
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:35,575
this new copycat killer
who surfaced.

530
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:37,977
Ask me, it was only a matter of
time before someone picked up

531
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,313
where the original killer left
off. You know, someone special.

532
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:41,714
Someone who knew there was
a need for what he did.

533
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:44,717
Right. The original killer,
he was an auteur.

534
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:45,885
But this new guy,
he's just...

535
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:47,687
Sort of a cheap copy.

536
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,223
Whoa.

537
00:19:50,257 --> 00:19:51,624
Hold on a second.

538
00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:53,360
This new guy is
not the original,

539
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:55,228
okay, but he is
a damn sweet cover.

540
00:19:55,262 --> 00:19:56,896
He is efficient,
he is precise.

541
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,698
I mean, he gets the
little details right,

542
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:00,767
down to the
interlocking fingers.

543
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,802
Detective Decker, LAPD.

544
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:06,839
That information wasn't
public yet, was it?

545
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:08,475
No, it wasn't.

546
00:20:08,508 --> 00:20:11,244
Finally, this bloody
charade is over,

547
00:20:11,278 --> 00:20:12,745
and things can all
go back to normal.

548
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:18,351
I'll meet you
back at the precinct.

549
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:21,654
(handcuffs clicking)
Ow.

550
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:33,065
WOMAN (voice echoing):
You're burning my table.

551
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:39,539
Can I help you?

552
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:40,840
Kay?

553
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:50,016
Kay. Kay, how is this possible?

554
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:51,818
Is this a prank?

555
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:53,420
Did someone put you up to this?

556
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:54,754
Look, I get it.

557
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:55,922
I look just like
my grandmother,

558
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:57,424
but this is taking things
too far.

559
00:20:57,457 --> 00:20:58,725
(chuckles)

560
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,627
Your grandmother,
of course.

561
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,029
I'm sorry, I knew her
back in the day.

562
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:04,764
The resemblance is
incredible.

563
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:06,566
You knew her back in the day?

564
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:07,867
How old were you, like, two?

565
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,736
I'm older than I look.

566
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:14,507
Well, Mr. Older Than
You Look, I'm Maddie.

567
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:15,908
Hi. Pierce.

568
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:18,611
I used to come in here a lot,

569
00:21:18,645 --> 00:21:19,779
back when I was just
a detective.

570
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:21,414
That's what we do here--

571
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:23,716
cheap drinks,
good cooking and cops.

572
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,419
That's actually how
my grandparents met.

573
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:27,620
Gramps was a cop,

574
00:21:27,654 --> 00:21:29,389
and he met Nana when
she was waiting tables.

575
00:21:29,422 --> 00:21:32,024
"Raids" White is
your grandfather?
Yep.

576
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:33,560
Cops are always
coming in here

577
00:21:33,593 --> 00:21:34,727
and geeking out over him.

578
00:21:34,761 --> 00:21:36,463
Well, yeah.
Kay married the cop

579
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:38,331
who solved the Broken
Hearts Killer case.

580
00:21:38,365 --> 00:21:40,867
Well, he made the arrest,
but he never really solved it.

581
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,635
He caught the guy red-handed,

582
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:44,337
staging bodies
in the Chavez Ravine.

583
00:21:44,371 --> 00:21:46,773
True, but he never revealed how
he chose his victims.

584
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:49,376
It drove Gramps crazy,
so he kept at it

585
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:50,242
even after he retired.

586
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:53,380
He would sit in that
booth right there

587
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:56,383
with his old files
when Nana worked.
(chuckles)

588
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:58,351
Where is Ray these days?

589
00:21:58,385 --> 00:22:00,820
Forest Lawn Cemetery.

590
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:04,791
Uh, Gramps passed about
six years ago.

591
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,826
(sighs)
And her?

592
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:09,696
MADDIE:
Followed a little after.

593
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,099
(sighs) I'm sorry.
Don't be.

594
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:15,835
They lived a long,
happy life together,

595
00:22:15,868 --> 00:22:18,471
and went peacefully,
a few months apart.

596
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:21,007
That sounds nice.

597
00:22:25,912 --> 00:22:28,581
All right, case
closed, I assume.

598
00:22:28,615 --> 00:22:30,783
And not a particularly
interesting one, in retrospect.

599
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:33,653
Let's find something that's
more challenging, you know?

600
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:35,788
More "us."

601
00:22:35,822 --> 00:22:37,957
This case isn't over. We have to
get a confession out of Neil.

602
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:41,060
Oh, so you and Pierce can do
your dynamic duo thing again?

603
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:43,696
No. It's you and me this time,
no Pierce.

604
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:46,933
Oh. No Pierce, but we're still
following his lead in absentia.

605
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:48,568
We are following the case.

606
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:50,102
Let's go solve this.

607
00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:54,407
So Neil, from your tour,

608
00:22:54,441 --> 00:22:56,509
I saw that you like
to tell a good story,

609
00:22:56,543 --> 00:23:00,146
so tell me one now:
how'd you do it?

610
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:01,448
Yeah.

611
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:03,716
Uh, well, it was early.

612
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,885
And, uh, we met at a bar.

613
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:08,087
And then, I, uh,
I gave him a sign.

614
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,558
And he came over, at which
point, I think I said, "Hey,"

615
00:23:11,591 --> 00:23:13,460
and then, he was all like...

616
00:23:13,493 --> 00:23:15,094
"Hey," and then...
Right. Can you
fast-forward

617
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:17,730
to the part where you smashed
the couples' chests in?

618
00:23:17,764 --> 00:23:19,832
Wait a minute.

619
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:22,068
You-you think I'm the copycat?

620
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:24,203
You fit the killer's
psychological profile to a T,

621
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:27,740
you know things about the case
that no one else could know.

622
00:23:27,774 --> 00:23:29,041
Oh, my God.

623
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:31,143
This is gonna be
so amazing for the tour.

624
00:23:31,177 --> 00:23:33,613
Now I'm actually part
of the investigation.

625
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:35,515
Oh, geez, I owe McMillan now.

626
00:23:35,548 --> 00:23:36,516
Mc... McMillan?

627
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:38,651
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Officer McMillan over in Vice.

628
00:23:38,685 --> 00:23:39,886
He's helped me out
throughout the years.

629
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,020
You know, he would
slip me, uh,

630
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:42,622
copies of stuff
for the tour.

631
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:43,990
And then, when these new
killings started happening,

632
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:45,558
well, I bought
some photos off of him,

633
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:47,159
and it was the best 400 bucks
I've ever spent.

634
00:23:47,193 --> 00:23:50,497
Ha! So Pierce doesn't know
everything, after all.

635
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:55,868
Thank you.

636
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,108
Hey, Dan.

637
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:03,743
If you're looking
for Twisted Ferret,

638
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,211
they've got a gig
in Bakersfield.

639
00:24:05,244 --> 00:24:06,513
(chuckles softly)

640
00:24:06,546 --> 00:24:08,481
They'll be back.

641
00:24:08,515 --> 00:24:12,685
Because this gig is still
the best gig in town.

642
00:24:12,719 --> 00:24:13,886
The school called.

643
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,488
Apparently,
Trixie gave pot brownies

644
00:24:15,522 --> 00:24:17,657
to Ms. Benson
for Teacher Appreciation Day.

645
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,792
Well, did she appreciate them?

646
00:24:19,826 --> 00:24:21,728
No, she didn't, Maze.

647
00:24:21,761 --> 00:24:24,731
She didn't appreciate being
rushed to the hospital

648
00:24:24,764 --> 00:24:26,533
when she couldn't feel
her legs anymore.

649
00:24:26,566 --> 00:24:28,167
(laughs)

650
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,002
The woman's 70 years old.
What the hell were you thinking?

651
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:33,940
Hey, not my fault the old hag
can't handle the good stuff.

652
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:35,808
It's not a joke, Maze!

653
00:24:35,842 --> 00:24:37,644
Our one red line
is our daughter,

654
00:24:37,677 --> 00:24:39,746
and things like this
cannot happen.

655
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:42,782
Or what, Douche?

656
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,517
(exhales)

657
00:24:44,551 --> 00:24:47,654
If you want to live in
the same home as my kid,

658
00:24:47,687 --> 00:24:52,224
you can't keep pulling
stunts like this.

659
00:24:52,258 --> 00:24:53,793
Fine.

660
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:55,194
I'll move out.

661
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:56,563
Since none of you
want me here anyway.

662
00:24:56,596 --> 00:24:57,864
That's not what I'm saying.

663
00:24:57,897 --> 00:24:59,532
No.

664
00:24:59,566 --> 00:25:03,135
No, you would all love me
to be something I'm not.

665
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:05,938
Well, I am not a babysitter.

666
00:25:05,972 --> 00:25:07,607
I am not a roommate.

667
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,977
And I am sick of your
Goody Two-shoes ex-wife,

668
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,946
and that stupid little brat
of yours anyway.

669
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,082
(quietly):
Maze.

670
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,691
Classy.

671
00:25:25,992 --> 00:25:27,259
PIERCE:
So Neil isn't our killer.

672
00:25:27,293 --> 00:25:30,096
No, he's just an obsessed
tour guide

673
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:32,632
who legally obtained
crime scene photos.

674
00:25:32,665 --> 00:25:34,867
So we don't have any suspects.
CHLOE: Yeah, and our killer

675
00:25:34,901 --> 00:25:35,968
could be trying
to find his next victim.

676
00:25:36,002 --> 00:25:37,236
We need a lead.

677
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,871
Hold on.

678
00:25:38,905 --> 00:25:42,074
You said your grandfather kept
copies of all his files.

679
00:25:42,108 --> 00:25:43,242
Do you still have them?

680
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:44,877
Somewhere in the back, yeah.

681
00:25:44,911 --> 00:25:46,746
My mom didn't have the heart
to throw them out.

682
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:48,014
You mind if I take a look?

683
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:49,749
Sure.

684
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:53,052
Chloe, meet me at The Adams.

685
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:54,654
I may have something.

686
00:25:54,687 --> 00:25:56,022
Yeah. I'm on my way.

687
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:57,924
LUCIFER: Ah. I
know that look.

688
00:25:57,957 --> 00:25:59,892
Either there are new sandwiches
in the vending machine,

689
00:25:59,926 --> 00:26:00,993
or you have a lead.

690
00:26:01,027 --> 00:26:02,762
Actually, Pierce has a lead.

691
00:26:02,795 --> 00:26:04,330
Oh, for goodness' sake.

692
00:26:04,363 --> 00:26:05,865
He wants us to meet him.
Why?

693
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,166
So we can watch him pontificate

694
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:08,868
while leading us down
another blind alley?

695
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,903
What is your problem today?

696
00:26:10,937 --> 00:26:14,006
My problem, Detective, is that
we don't need a third party

697
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,608
interfering with
our partnership.

698
00:26:15,642 --> 00:26:16,909
You know what?
Maybe it's best

699
00:26:16,943 --> 00:26:18,277
if I meet Pierce alone.

700
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,312
We don't have time
to make this about you.

701
00:26:20,346 --> 00:26:22,649
There is a serial killer
on the loose.

702
00:26:22,682 --> 00:26:24,651
Uh... Detective.

703
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,792
KAY: To wrapping up
your latest case.

704
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:34,326
Sayonara, Broken Hearts Killer.

705
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,928
Well, Ray was actually
the one to catch him,

706
00:26:35,962 --> 00:26:38,330
but I'm happy
to drink to that anyway.

707
00:26:40,967 --> 00:26:43,102
(sighs)

708
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:46,639
Now, maybe you can take me
on a real date,

709
00:26:46,673 --> 00:26:49,041
instead of just pie
and drinks here.

710
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:54,346
(sighs, clears throat)

711
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:57,917
Let me guess,
you already have your next case.

712
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,285
No, not this time.

713
00:26:59,318 --> 00:27:02,789
Um...

714
00:27:02,822 --> 00:27:04,791
I'm transferring.

715
00:27:04,824 --> 00:27:05,892
Out of state.

716
00:27:05,925 --> 00:27:07,727
Transferring?

717
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,795
Why?

718
00:27:08,828 --> 00:27:11,998
It's just... time.

719
00:27:12,031 --> 00:27:13,733
I don't understand.

720
00:27:13,766 --> 00:27:16,002
This is what I do. I move
forward and I never look back.

721
00:27:16,035 --> 00:27:18,270
But I thought we...
you and I were...

722
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:19,972
I deal with death
every day,

723
00:27:20,006 --> 00:27:22,008
and someday, you're gonna die,
too, and I just...

724
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:23,676
You have these
walls up,

725
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:26,813
and I thought it was part
of your whole tough guy act,

726
00:27:26,846 --> 00:27:31,417
but now I see what it is:
you're scared.

727
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,920
But you know what
the sad truth is?

728
00:27:33,953 --> 00:27:35,788
If you don't
learn to open up,

729
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:39,258
nobody will ever love you.

730
00:27:41,728 --> 00:27:43,095
I know.

731
00:27:43,129 --> 00:27:44,764
CHLOE:
Pierce, look at this.

732
00:27:46,866 --> 00:27:48,434
Hey.

733
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:49,902
Pierce.

734
00:27:49,936 --> 00:27:51,037
Are you okay?

735
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,338
Yeah, sorry. Um...

736
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:53,940
(clears throat)
What were you saying?

737
00:27:53,973 --> 00:27:55,307
Your mentor,

738
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:57,877
look at all this stuff
that he found, like,

739
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,311
look-- these call logs.

740
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:01,480
They prove that the
original killer's victims

741
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,784
all had spouses that called
into the Dear Dottie radio show.

742
00:28:04,817 --> 00:28:08,020
That was a radio show about
love and relationship advice.

743
00:28:08,054 --> 00:28:09,255
Yeah.

744
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:10,489
Yeah. You really know
your history.

745
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,491
(chuckles softly)
A-Anyway,

746
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,194
it's the only connection that
was found between the victims.

747
00:28:15,227 --> 00:28:16,796
But that show went off the air
years ago.

748
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:18,464
I'm not sure
how it's gonna help us now.

749
00:28:18,497 --> 00:28:21,200
Well, if the original killer
listened to the radio show

750
00:28:21,233 --> 00:28:22,434
to find his victims, then maybe

751
00:28:22,468 --> 00:28:24,203
the copycat's doing
the same thing.

752
00:28:24,236 --> 00:28:26,973
So the question is what
radio show would that be now?

753
00:28:27,006 --> 00:28:28,507
Oh, my God. Chance's Chocolates?

754
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,076
I'm obsessed.

755
00:28:30,109 --> 00:28:33,279
It's a radio show that sets up
cheating couples.

756
00:28:33,312 --> 00:28:35,247
See, Chance brings
someone on who thinks

757
00:28:35,281 --> 00:28:37,216
their spouse is
cheating, and then,

758
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:40,419
he calls the cheater pretending
to be a candy shop

759
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:42,321
giving away free chocolates
as a promotion,

760
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:44,323
and asks
who they should send it to.

761
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:46,325
How thrilling.
Huh.
Right?

762
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:48,360
And then, the person
either names their partner

763
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:52,264
and "Aw, happy ending,"
or... they name someone else,

764
00:28:52,298 --> 00:28:54,100
and expose
their dirty,

765
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:55,101
cheating ways.

766
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:56,202
Oh, it's so juicy.

767
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:58,204
So it turns out, both couples

768
00:28:58,237 --> 00:28:59,772
had a significant other
that appeared on the show.

769
00:28:59,806 --> 00:29:01,340
LUCIFER: So
we're assuming

770
00:29:01,373 --> 00:29:03,976
that our killer listens
to this juvenile program?

771
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:05,544
We've narrowed
our suspects down to anyone

772
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,247
who doesn't have
satellite radio, and Ms. Lopez.

773
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,249
Actually, the addresses
are beeped out.

774
00:29:10,282 --> 00:29:12,518
Probably for reasons like this.

775
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:15,254
Okay, so the killer has to be
somebody that works on the show.

776
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:16,823
Someone with access
to this info?

777
00:29:16,856 --> 00:29:19,926
Right. So we need to make
ourselves the target,

778
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:21,260
and flush the killer out.

779
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:22,862
Great idea.
Decker and I will do it.

780
00:29:22,895 --> 00:29:24,096
We'll give out
my home address

781
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,097
and lure the killer there.

782
00:29:25,131 --> 00:29:26,398
Sure.

783
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:28,868
That could work.
ELLA:
Oh, man.

784
00:29:28,901 --> 00:29:30,436
You guys are totally gonna be
the cheating lovers.

785
00:29:30,469 --> 00:29:33,005
Marvelous. Well,
since that's been sorted,

786
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,207
I assume my services
are no longer needed.

787
00:29:35,241 --> 00:29:36,408
Uh, actually,

788
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:38,277
there is one
more piece

789
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,879
of the sting we'll need.

790
00:29:39,912 --> 00:29:42,414
CHANCE: And we are here
with our jilted lover, Lucifer.

791
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:43,983
(laughing):
Now, first off,

792
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:46,118
what is up with that name?
"Lucifer"? I-I...

793
00:29:46,152 --> 00:29:47,820
You think maybe

794
00:29:47,854 --> 00:29:49,421
that is part of the reason
that's driving a wedge

795
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:50,890
between you and your old lady?

796
00:29:50,923 --> 00:29:53,459
Well, first off,
I am not a "jilted lover."

797
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:56,062
No, no. No one ever wants
to believe that, do they?

798
00:29:56,095 --> 00:29:58,297
But you wouldn't be here
if you probably didn't think

799
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,899
something was going on, right?

800
00:29:59,932 --> 00:30:02,168
And we're gonna find out
exactly what that is

801
00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:03,502
when we come back.

802
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:05,004
(clears throat, sniffles)

803
00:30:05,037 --> 00:30:06,172
You're doing great, by the way.

804
00:30:06,205 --> 00:30:07,907
You're late!

805
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:10,209
BRANDON: Yeah, sorry I'm late.
Traffic was just awful.

806
00:30:11,277 --> 00:30:12,344
Stop.

807
00:30:12,378 --> 00:30:14,413
I ordered a pastrami.

808
00:30:14,446 --> 00:30:17,183
Is this pastrami?
No, it is not pastrami!

809
00:30:17,216 --> 00:30:18,584
Now get out of here!

810
00:30:18,617 --> 00:30:21,453
And we are back
with our guest Lucifer,

811
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:24,456
who is now gonna tell us
all about his girl Chloe.

812
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:29,595
Uh, right. Well, um,
she's my partner.

813
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:30,930
At work.

814
00:30:30,963 --> 00:30:32,464
Oh, so it's
a workplace thing, huh?

815
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:34,300
When did things change?

816
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:38,470
Well, she's been spending quite
a bit of time with our new boss.

817
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:40,239
Cheating on you with the boss?

818
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:41,440
Oh, that's low.

819
00:30:41,473 --> 00:30:43,109
Well, it's quite
a bit more complex

820
00:30:43,142 --> 00:30:45,144
than your obnoxious braying's
making it out to be.

821
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:46,512
Well, let's find out, shall we?

822
00:30:46,545 --> 00:30:48,247
Let's get Chloe on the line.

823
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:50,582
Uh, yes?

824
00:30:50,616 --> 00:30:52,184
CHANCE (Swiss accent):
Uh, hello, uh, Chloe?

825
00:30:52,218 --> 00:30:54,486
Uh, this is, uh, Pop Sugar.

826
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,356
We are a new Swiss chocolate
shop in Los Feliz,

827
00:30:57,389 --> 00:30:59,558
and we are, uh,
running a big promotion.

828
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:02,328
Yeah, we are going to send, uh,
a free box of chocolates

829
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:04,563
to, uh, your special someone,

830
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:06,465
if you have
a special someone somewhere?

831
00:31:06,498 --> 00:31:08,267
CHLOE:
Oh, wow.

832
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,601
Wow, yeah, that's awesome. Um...

833
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:12,004
and-and actually,
it's perfect timing.

834
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:14,340
Um, as we're having, um,
a date night tonight.

835
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:15,607
Oh! Wonderful.

836
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:17,910
All we need, then,
is his name and address.

837
00:31:17,944 --> 00:31:20,446
Yeah, his name is Marcus,
and he lives at...

838
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:23,149
(old-fashioned car horn
sound effect brays)

839
00:31:23,182 --> 00:31:25,084
Okay, Chloe, that is good.

840
00:31:25,117 --> 00:31:26,452
Listen, I'm just curious,

841
00:31:26,485 --> 00:31:29,188
because we're all
such romantics here,

842
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:31,590
what is it about, uh,
t-this, uh, guy

843
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:33,960
that gives you the goose bumps?

844
00:31:33,993 --> 00:31:37,029
Uh...

845
00:31:37,063 --> 00:31:38,297
um...

846
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,933
well, he's, um...

847
00:31:40,967 --> 00:31:43,302
he's...

848
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:45,037
he's very handsome.

849
00:31:45,071 --> 00:31:47,706
Yeah, but isn't there anything,
uh, more than just looks?

850
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,442
Um, well, he's very brave,

851
00:31:50,476 --> 00:31:54,180
and we both care
about the same sorts of things,

852
00:31:54,213 --> 00:31:56,482
like, well, doing what's right,

853
00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:58,717
and, uh,
and helping other people.

854
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,187
I think he's a good person.

855
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,588
Sounds like
a hell of a guy.

856
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:05,191
Uh, and we'll make sure
to get that package to him

857
00:32:05,224 --> 00:32:08,194
uh, before the end of the night.

858
00:32:08,227 --> 00:32:10,162
Okay, thanks.

859
00:32:10,196 --> 00:32:12,498
(normal voice):
And there you have it, everyone.

860
00:32:12,531 --> 00:32:14,666
Another cheater exposed.

861
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,435
(chuckles) Sometimes,
chocolate can be dark,

862
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:18,037
but you know what?

863
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:20,206
Isn't better to always know
the... truth?

864
00:32:20,239 --> 00:32:22,474
Where the hell did he go?

865
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:31,150
Welcome to my humble abode.

866
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:32,484
Um...

867
00:32:32,518 --> 00:32:33,685
I like rocks.

868
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:36,622
You have a
rock collection?

869
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:38,257
Well, the thing about rocks
is they're old.

870
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,226
They never change.

871
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:43,162
I've taken one from all
the places I've visited.

872
00:32:43,195 --> 00:32:46,532
You've been a lot
of places, huh?

873
00:32:46,565 --> 00:32:49,501
Well, gather no moss
and all that.

874
00:32:49,535 --> 00:32:51,503
I know I don't have
a lot of things,

875
00:32:51,537 --> 00:32:55,374
but what I love about this place
is the killer view.

876
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:59,078
Oh, my God.

877
00:32:59,111 --> 00:33:01,013
This is beautiful.

878
00:33:01,047 --> 00:33:03,115
(Pierce chuckles)

879
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:04,150
Decker, listen.

880
00:33:04,183 --> 00:33:07,086
I know that our, uh,
opportunity for a second date

881
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,287
was interrupted earlier.

882
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,389
Hopefully this will
make up for it.

883
00:33:10,422 --> 00:33:12,558
DAN:
Hey, you guys all set?

884
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:15,061
(clears throat)

885
00:33:15,094 --> 00:33:17,296
Hey, Dan. Yeah.
We're all set here.

886
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:19,031
Coast is clear on my end.

887
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:22,734
Ah, excellent. Daniel.
You're here.

888
00:33:22,768 --> 00:33:25,104
Hey, pal. I didn't know you
were coming in for this one.

889
00:33:25,137 --> 00:33:29,075
I wasn't, but, um, I wanted
to ask you something.

890
00:33:29,108 --> 00:33:30,409
Okay.

891
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:32,811
How did you move on
from the detective

892
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,480
when I showed up
and replaced you?

893
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:37,249
And please,
don't say improv.

894
00:33:37,283 --> 00:33:39,551
You didn't replace me.
Well, true, true.

895
00:33:39,585 --> 00:33:41,053
I suppose that would imply
we're on the same level.

896
00:33:41,087 --> 00:33:44,390
(sighs) Look, I get
it. All right?

897
00:33:44,423 --> 00:33:46,425
I get how you feel with this
whole Pierce and Chloe thing.

898
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:48,294
Mm.
And, yes,

899
00:33:48,327 --> 00:33:51,597
I admit, I did feel a little
jealous when you showed up.

900
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,265
Well, justifiably so.

901
00:33:53,299 --> 00:33:56,268
(sighs) But then I realized
you had nothing to do

902
00:33:56,302 --> 00:33:57,436
with why my marriage ended.

903
00:33:57,469 --> 00:33:59,071
You and I are
different people.

904
00:33:59,105 --> 00:34:01,107
We each have our own
relationship with Chloe.

905
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,209
Once I came to terms
with that, I was fine.

906
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:08,080
I hope you don't mind.

907
00:34:08,114 --> 00:34:10,749
I asked Lopez what
your favorite dish was.

908
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:14,720
No, it's, um, it's great.

909
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:18,224
Is something wrong?

910
00:34:18,257 --> 00:34:19,625
Um...

911
00:34:19,658 --> 00:34:23,295
um, Marcus, maybe we
shouldn't do this.

912
00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:25,231
Are we too visible?

913
00:34:25,264 --> 00:34:26,832
No.

914
00:34:26,865 --> 00:34:28,700
Is the plan too obvious?
No, no, no.

915
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:30,369
I mean you and me.

916
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,471
You know, we work together
and things could get weird.

917
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:33,739
That's all.

918
00:34:33,772 --> 00:34:36,142
Look, you asked me
out first, Decker.

919
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:41,213
I, uh... I did

920
00:34:41,247 --> 00:34:42,781
and you turned me down.

921
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:47,353
And I... I was disappointed,
but, you know, I got it.

922
00:34:47,386 --> 00:34:50,222
And you're the one who said
you're, you know,

923
00:34:50,256 --> 00:34:51,623
"not relationship material."

924
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:57,396
You're a good man
and I really like you,

925
00:34:57,429 --> 00:35:02,134
but I, uh, I-I need somebody
who can let me in

926
00:35:02,168 --> 00:35:05,737
and I just don't know
if that's... you.

927
00:35:15,281 --> 00:35:17,483
Hello, shadowy figure.

928
00:35:17,516 --> 00:35:19,685
Here to spoil the date?

929
00:35:21,487 --> 00:35:22,688
(grunting)

930
00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:24,890
God! God!

931
00:35:24,923 --> 00:35:27,559
LAPD. You're under arrest.

932
00:35:27,593 --> 00:35:29,295
I know my rights, okay?

933
00:35:29,328 --> 00:35:32,164
Fair use, I want a lawyer.

934
00:35:32,198 --> 00:35:33,799
Pastrami boy?
(chuckles)

935
00:35:33,832 --> 00:35:36,368
You're the killer?
Killer? What?

936
00:35:36,402 --> 00:35:38,170
What are you talking about?
Dude, I'm here for the show.

937
00:35:38,204 --> 00:35:40,272
What show?
The show, the show.

938
00:35:40,306 --> 00:35:43,175
I-I-I try to film an angry ex
busting in on their spouse.

939
00:35:43,209 --> 00:35:45,811
Like you and then I
put it up on my Web site

940
00:35:45,844 --> 00:35:48,680
as a bootleg
after show. Hey!

941
00:35:48,714 --> 00:35:50,749
Hey, look, I'm trying
to be a producer, man.

942
00:35:50,782 --> 00:35:52,584
The only reason
I'm interning

943
00:35:52,618 --> 00:35:54,186
is so I can get access
to those tapes

944
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,288
and I post those tapes raw
and unedited on my Web site.

945
00:35:56,322 --> 00:35:57,589
Unedited?

946
00:35:57,623 --> 00:35:59,191
Without the addresses
censored out?

947
00:35:59,225 --> 00:36:00,859
Well, yeah, I mean,
that's what unedited means.

948
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:02,761
I'm showing life
at its most raw.

949
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:06,432
Ow.

950
00:36:06,465 --> 00:36:08,367
The killer could be listening
to those tapes.

951
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,868
Could be anyone.

952
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:41,633
* Waiting in the shadows

953
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:46,405
* Till the sun goes down...

954
00:36:46,438 --> 00:36:50,008
Maybe I should've waited
until after dinner

955
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,810
to say all that.

956
00:36:51,843 --> 00:36:53,612
No, you're right.

957
00:36:53,645 --> 00:36:55,247
I do have walls up.

958
00:36:55,281 --> 00:36:57,549
I've had them up
for a long, long time.

959
00:36:57,583 --> 00:36:59,451
When I feel like someone's

960
00:36:59,485 --> 00:37:01,553
getting past them, I run.

961
00:37:01,587 --> 00:37:05,023
But with you, Chloe, I don't
want those walls up anymore.

962
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,725
I don't want to run anymore.

963
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:09,428
You deserve someone
who's gonna let you in

964
00:37:09,461 --> 00:37:11,630
and I want to do that
if you'll give me the chance.

965
00:37:11,663 --> 00:37:14,232
(stammers) That's...

966
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:17,936
Chloe?

967
00:37:19,605 --> 00:37:22,608
You all right?

968
00:37:22,641 --> 00:37:23,975
Chloe!

969
00:37:24,009 --> 00:37:26,912
Chloe.

970
00:37:42,428 --> 00:37:43,662
*

971
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:05,751
You shouldn't have hurt him.

972
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:10,556
(grunting)
Too bad.

973
00:38:10,589 --> 00:38:13,359
If you'd started with him,
I would've let you swing.

974
00:38:13,392 --> 00:38:15,827
You... you're the... you're
the guy from the radio.

975
00:38:15,861 --> 00:38:17,563
Yes, and you're the chap

976
00:38:17,596 --> 00:38:19,030
who bought the original
killer's house.

977
00:38:19,064 --> 00:38:20,899
How remarkably
method of you.

978
00:38:20,932 --> 00:38:22,634
Don't-don't-don't
you get it?

979
00:38:22,668 --> 00:38:24,102
I-I-I-I did this for you.

980
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:27,105
I-I... these-these two,
they-they-they betrayed you.

981
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,107
(chuckles) I didn't
ask for this.

982
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:29,741
But you deserve it.

983
00:38:29,775 --> 00:38:31,610
I found Hoffman's journals

984
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:33,078
hidden in the attic.

985
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:35,814
He understood how hard it is
to lose someone you care about.

986
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:37,048
We wanted to show the world

987
00:38:37,082 --> 00:38:39,050
that you-you can't
just leave people.

988
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:45,090
You don't get to decide who
someone wants to be with.

989
00:38:48,694 --> 00:38:50,496
And neither do I.

990
00:38:52,631 --> 00:38:54,866
Does this mean you're-you're
not, you're not gonna...

991
00:38:56,902 --> 00:38:58,904
Detective.

992
00:39:03,575 --> 00:39:05,877
Oh, my God. Are they okay?

993
00:39:05,911 --> 00:39:08,880
They're fine.
They're fine.

994
00:39:08,914 --> 00:39:10,682
Come on. Wakey-wakey, Detective.

995
00:39:10,716 --> 00:39:12,651
DAN:
Come on, pal.

996
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:15,521
Lieutenant Pierce.

997
00:39:22,661 --> 00:39:24,996
BARISTA: I've got a
wake-up for Charlotte.

998
00:39:33,572 --> 00:39:35,373
(sighs)

999
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,645
You are following me.

1000
00:39:39,678 --> 00:39:42,448
No, this-this is, this is just
where I come to read the paper.

1001
00:39:42,481 --> 00:39:45,016
I know when people
are lying to me.

1002
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:48,687
Honestly, this is just,
um, all... it's really...

1003
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,756
all a big misunderstanding.

1004
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:55,861
(chuckles) So all the crazy
stuff you said earlier...

1005
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:57,496
is a misunderstanding?

1006
00:39:57,529 --> 00:40:00,499
Please, I just...

1007
00:40:02,468 --> 00:40:06,438
You don't understand
what it's like

1008
00:40:06,472 --> 00:40:07,939
not remembering
what you did,

1009
00:40:07,973 --> 00:40:11,009
not knowing who you were.

1010
00:40:11,042 --> 00:40:15,681
All I want is the truth.

1011
00:40:15,714 --> 00:40:18,049
How do we know each other?

1012
00:40:19,951 --> 00:40:22,053
You were my mom.

1013
00:40:24,723 --> 00:40:26,492
I know.

1014
00:40:26,525 --> 00:40:28,860
I know.

1015
00:40:28,894 --> 00:40:32,063
Please, have a seat.

1016
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:35,901
There is, uh, there is
so much to explain.

1017
00:40:49,014 --> 00:40:51,082
Olga? Wait, I'm sorry.

1018
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:53,785
I thought that Maze was gonna
be here watching Trixie.

1019
00:40:53,819 --> 00:40:55,253
No Maze.

1020
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:59,090
She said mean thing
to me and then she go.

1021
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:01,192
What do you mean, "she go"?

1022
00:41:01,226 --> 00:41:04,796
She take her knives
and she move out.

1023
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:07,232
Oh.

1024
00:41:07,265 --> 00:41:09,868
Thank you, Olga.
(grunts)

1025
00:41:09,901 --> 00:41:11,703
I know. Thank you, though.

1026
00:41:17,843 --> 00:41:19,811
(knocking at door)

1027
00:41:19,845 --> 00:41:21,647
Olga, did you forget something?

1028
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,948
Well, that's a new one.

1029
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:24,783
Never been mistaken
for an Olga before.

1030
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:26,685
(chuckles)

1031
00:41:26,718 --> 00:41:28,954
What are you doing here?

1032
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:32,123
I, um...

1033
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:33,859
I wanted to explain.

1034
00:41:33,892 --> 00:41:36,862
Look, I know that
I've been acting...
Insecure.

1035
00:41:36,895 --> 00:41:39,164
Childish. Possessive.

1036
00:41:39,197 --> 00:41:40,732
Well, I was going
to say strangely, but...

1037
00:41:40,766 --> 00:41:42,701
(sighs)
...never mind.

1038
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:46,137
The truth is that perhaps
I was slightly insecure

1039
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:48,640
about Pierce moving in
on our partnership.

1040
00:41:48,674 --> 00:41:49,975
Oh, Lucifer, that's
not what's happening.

1041
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:51,743
No, I know,

1042
00:41:51,777 --> 00:41:53,612
because I've realized that
there's room in your life

1043
00:41:53,645 --> 00:41:57,749
for all sorts
of relationships,

1044
00:41:57,783 --> 00:42:01,019
even if one of them
is with... with him.

1045
00:42:01,052 --> 00:42:03,088
I know...
Just...

1046
00:42:03,121 --> 00:42:05,090
please, be careful.

1047
00:42:05,123 --> 00:42:07,859
(chuckles softly)

1048
00:42:07,893 --> 00:42:10,195
Okay.

1049
00:42:10,228 --> 00:42:12,831
Do you want to stay?
I can make some coffee

1050
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:15,300
and we can...
Ah, I can't,
unfortunately.

1051
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:18,870
There's a bachelorette party
at Lux and... well.

1052
00:42:18,904 --> 00:42:20,839
Okay, another time.

1053
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:22,307
Yes.

1054
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:27,713
Okay, well... have fun.

1055
00:42:30,782 --> 00:42:32,050
(mutters under breath)

1056
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:35,921
* Bring on your
forces of nature *

1057
00:42:35,954 --> 00:42:38,323
* Mm, mm, mm

1058
00:42:38,356 --> 00:42:43,795
* Bring on the storm
that's raging *

1059
00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:45,030
* Mm, mm, mm...

1060
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:46,197
CHLOE:
Dinner sounds great.

1061
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:47,799
How about tomorrow?

1062
00:42:47,833 --> 00:42:49,701
That's perfect.
Good. I'll pick you up at 7:00?

1063
00:42:49,735 --> 00:42:52,638
Yeah.
I'll see you then, Chloe.

1064
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,042
Someone special, I assume?

1065
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:58,944
Yes, she is.

1066
00:42:58,977 --> 00:43:01,713
And for the first time in
my life, I'm gonna go for it.

1067
00:43:01,747 --> 00:43:03,214
Good for you.

1068
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:04,816
You have to risk
a broken heart

1069
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:06,618
if you want to get something
out of this life, right?

1070
00:43:06,652 --> 00:43:08,586
It's not my heart
I'm risking.

1071
00:43:10,021 --> 00:43:11,957
She's the key to finally getting
what I've always wanted.

1072
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:13,224
* Torches

1073
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:15,761
* Ooh, ooh.
