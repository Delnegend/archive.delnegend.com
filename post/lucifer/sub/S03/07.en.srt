1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,109
(inhales deeply)

2
00:00:13,414 --> 00:00:17,051
(exhales)

3
00:00:17,085 --> 00:00:19,653
Welcome back to the land
of the living, Mr. Getty.

4
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:29,597
What...?

5
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,133
What happened?

6
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:34,368
Just a little brush with death.

7
00:00:34,402 --> 00:00:37,138
You had us worried there
for a while.

8
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:38,506
Oh.

9
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:41,275
(groans softly)

10
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:43,277
Is my wife here?

11
00:00:43,311 --> 00:00:45,479
No.

12
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:48,649
I'm sorry, you haven't
had any visitors.

13
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:51,219
Well...

14
00:00:51,252 --> 00:00:54,322
we have been having
some trouble lately.

15
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,159
But you know what?

16
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:00,494
Second chance on life.

17
00:01:00,528 --> 00:01:03,831
Maybe it's not too late
to turn things around.

18
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:05,433
* Hey!

19
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:15,343
(woman giggling)

20
00:01:15,376 --> 00:01:16,644
(man and woman chattering)

21
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:18,146
(quietly):
No, you wouldn't.

22
00:01:18,179 --> 00:01:19,847
(woman giggling)

23
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,149
No.

24
00:01:21,182 --> 00:01:24,352
(woman laughs)

25
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:25,353
(door unlocks)

26
00:01:25,386 --> 00:01:28,422
So, sorry to shag and run,
darling, but, uh,

27
00:01:28,456 --> 00:01:30,691
I'll see you
next time.

28
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:32,360
All right.

29
00:01:32,393 --> 00:01:35,229
Ah. Lovely.

30
00:01:35,263 --> 00:01:38,399
* Aren't you really tired
of taking your clothes off *

31
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:43,671
* Making people think
that you're so tough *

32
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:44,905
* Hey!

33
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,241
* Oh, oh

34
00:01:47,275 --> 00:01:49,177
* Give it up

35
00:01:52,313 --> 00:01:54,715
* Please...

36
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:57,718
Who the hell
does he think he is?

37
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:59,253
Lucifer Morningstar.

38
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:01,289
You're serious?
That's his name?

39
00:02:01,322 --> 00:02:03,557
What kind of idiot
calls himself that?

40
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:06,126
The kind who owns this place.

41
00:02:10,298 --> 00:02:12,233
Don't think I haven't noticed
you watching me.

42
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:14,268
I know what
this is about.

43
00:02:14,302 --> 00:02:15,703
You do?

44
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:17,371
Yes,

45
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:18,739
and the answer is no.

46
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:20,241
I will not sleep with you.

47
00:02:20,274 --> 00:02:21,742
Excuse me?

48
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:24,278
It's not because you're a man.
It's just because...

49
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:25,546
Well, I don't
find you attractive.

50
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:27,281
But maybe I could

51
00:02:27,315 --> 00:02:30,318
introduce you to someone more,
you know, your league?

52
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:31,585
There's a chubby fellow
over there.

53
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:33,587
I'm sure he wouldn't mind giving
you a reach-around or something.

54
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:36,390
I'm married... to a woman,
thank you very much.

55
00:02:36,424 --> 00:02:37,725
Oh. Does she know you're gay?

56
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:38,792
My wife,

57
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:42,896
who's the smartest
and funniest person I ever met,

58
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,266
and the only woman
that I've ever loved,

59
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:47,301
is sleeping with another man.

60
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:51,739
A sleazy, arrogant,
womanizing piece of garbage.

61
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:54,442
Well, then, why are you wasting
time trying to pick me up?

62
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:56,444
You should be punishing him.

63
00:02:56,477 --> 00:02:57,911
Oh, don't worry.
I'm going to.

64
00:02:57,945 --> 00:02:58,812
Oh, are you? Great.

65
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:00,681
What are you gonna do,
spoons to the eyes?

66
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:01,582
Ants inside his urethra?

67
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:04,485
A Urethra Franklin,
as I like to call it.

68
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,320
I think I'm just gonna
punch him in the face.

69
00:03:06,354 --> 00:03:09,290
Well, that's not enough
for someone who stole your wife.

70
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:11,325
You're right.
Yeah.

71
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:13,361
You should destroy him.

72
00:03:13,394 --> 00:03:17,698
Tear his very life apart
piece by piece.

73
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,934
And normally,
I'd help you do that,

74
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:23,304
but I've picked up a new hobby
recently. Detective!

75
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:25,005
REESE:
Detective?

76
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,475
Yes. LAPD,
and I'm a consultant.

77
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:29,343
You? You work with the police?

78
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:31,712
Started a couple of weeks ago.
It's quite fun, actually.

79
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:33,947
Hey, you know,
I've been trying to reach you.

80
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:35,816
Detective, meet
my new friend. Uh...

81
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,818
Uh, Reese.
Hi.

82
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:40,654
Ah. Owner of the pieces.
(Reese chuckles)

83
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:41,822
Good to meet you.

84
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:43,491
Uh, sorry to interrupt,
but I need

85
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:46,727
my consultant to sober up
and join me at a crime scene.

86
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,962
Oh, sounds lovely. All right.

87
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:49,963
Nice meeting you.

88
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:50,931
LUCIFER:
Yes. Oh.

89
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,501
Good luck with the punishing.
(clicks tongue)

90
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:56,504
REESE:
Hey, boss, I got something.

91
00:03:56,537 --> 00:03:58,339
Sleeping in your
office again?

92
00:03:58,372 --> 00:03:59,740
No, I'm working
on my new story.

93
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:01,141
It's about
a shady nightclub owner.

94
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:04,312
(laughs)
My top investigative reporter
wants me to approve a piece

95
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:06,514
about overpriced booze
and go-go dancers?

96
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:08,048
No, no, it's a con man.

97
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,750
On paper, didn't even exist
five years ago.

98
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:11,985
Tells everyone
he's the Devil.

99
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:14,355
(scoffs) So he's a weirdo.
I don't see a story.

100
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:15,356
He's consulting for the LAPD.

101
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:18,025
I've got a bad feeling
this guy's up to no good.

102
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:20,027
Remember the last time
I had a bad feeling?

103
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,295
How can I forget your Pulitzer

104
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:22,496
when you won't stop
reminding me?

105
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,332
This son of a bitch
is hiding something.

106
00:04:24,365 --> 00:04:27,368
Who he is,
how he's exploiting the police.

107
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:31,004
Whatever it is, the people
deserve to know the truth.

108
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:32,239
Bringing this guy down,

109
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,775
there wouldn't be a personal
reason behind it, would there?

110
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:37,411
No. Of course not.

111
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,921
Lucifer!

112
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:52,025
Reese. Excuse me.

113
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:53,794
What are you
doing here?

114
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:55,929
Have you come to tell me about
the punishment you delivered?

115
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:58,466
Probably not best to go into
detail in a police station.

116
00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:01,769
No. After we met last night,
I realized how...

117
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,404
fascinating you are.

118
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:05,406
Oh, well, I can't
argue with that.

119
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:06,674
I'm a journalist
for the LA Telegraph.

120
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:09,910
So I pitched my editor, and she
said I could do a piece on you.

121
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:13,414
No. What, an entire
article dedicated to me?

122
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:14,648
(laughs)

123
00:05:14,682 --> 00:05:16,116
Right. Well, let's
start with a talk.

124
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,085
Gosh, this'll be fun.

125
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:24,024
*

126
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:33,467
REESE: Can you tell me
about this guy, Lucifer?

127
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:34,402
Yeah, he calls himself
"the Devil."

128
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:36,404
He helped me out
with some gambling debts.

129
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:37,538
Saved my life.

130
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:38,806
Five years ago?

131
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,542
I heard he was somewhere
terrible down south.

132
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:42,943
He introduced me to my husband.

133
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:43,944
And my horse.

134
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:45,546
Maybe Florida?

135
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:47,581
It's weird, but this is L.A.

136
00:05:49,517 --> 00:05:51,118
I don't know what to tell you.
I love the guy.

137
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:52,520
Just love that guy.

138
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:54,955
Everyone here
just loves Lucifer.

139
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:56,524
I don't like Lucifer.

140
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:58,659
Really?

141
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,661
For starters,

142
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,496
someone's been
stealing my pudding.

143
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,532
And I don't think
it's a coincidence

144
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:05,666
that it all started
when he showed up.

145
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,000
No.

146
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:09,136
And I'm not exactly in love
with the idea of my wife

147
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:11,505
putting herself in danger
just so some club owner

148
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:13,507
can have fun playing cop.

149
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,108
You and Detective Decker
are married?

150
00:06:16,444 --> 00:06:18,045
We're separated.

151
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:19,547
Oh, but still,

152
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,514
that's got to be hard
watching them

153
00:06:20,548 --> 00:06:21,749
frolic around in front of you.

154
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:24,585
I wouldn't say "frolic."

155
00:06:25,953 --> 00:06:27,421
(button clicks)

156
00:06:27,455 --> 00:06:29,590
Happy to keep this
off the record.

157
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:32,993
Separated is not divorced.
There's still time.

158
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:34,762
Excuse me. Hi.

159
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:36,464
Uh, I know you.

160
00:06:36,497 --> 00:06:37,765
Aren't you the
guy from Lux?

161
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:41,569
Reese Getty,
LA Telegraph.

162
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:43,704
I'm here to write a story
about you and Lucifer.

163
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,072
Oh, right.

164
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:47,541
"Former B-movie Actress
Turned Detective

165
00:06:47,575 --> 00:06:49,076
Works With a Whack-Job
Consultant."

166
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:50,578
Sounds about right.

167
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:51,712
Yeah. No thanks.

168
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,714
Detective Chloe Decker.
I did my research.

169
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:57,551
Hot Tub High School,
your dad, I get it.

170
00:06:57,585 --> 00:06:59,553
You don't like the press.

171
00:06:59,587 --> 00:07:00,754
I don't have time for this.

172
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:03,557
I have work to do that actually
contributes to society.

173
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:05,559
I hate to be the one
to break it to you,

174
00:07:05,593 --> 00:07:07,227
but your lieutenant
and my editor are like this.

175
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,062
I've been assigned to ride along
with you, Detective.

176
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:11,632
So we can either
make this a pleasant experience,

177
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:14,568
or we can do it the hard way.

178
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:16,504
I'll pick the hard way.

00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:26,146
* Yes, I'm dancing
in the fire *

181
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:28,649
REESE: So, you just started
showing up at crime scenes,

182
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:30,584
and eventually,
she let you work with her?

183
00:07:30,618 --> 00:07:32,252
LUCIFER:
Uh, more or less.

184
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,522
Yeah. Um, excuse us.
(clears throat)

185
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:36,790
No, no, no, just--
I'll stay out of your way.

186
00:07:36,824 --> 00:07:39,226
Just pretend
I'm not here.

187
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:40,594
Here you go.

188
00:07:40,628 --> 00:07:42,663
What am I supposed
to do with these?

189
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:44,632
Wear them... like
you always do.

190
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:46,534
Oh, right, yeah.
Mm-hmm.

191
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:48,068
I don't.
Hi.

192
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:49,670
DAN: Our victim's name
is Poppy Parker.

193
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:51,505
She owns an organic
cosmetics line.

194
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:54,608
Sort of a local celebrity
for all-natural skin care.

195
00:07:54,642 --> 00:07:56,510
CHLOE:
And, uh, what are all these?

196
00:07:56,544 --> 00:07:59,680
These are boobs.
Yes, I'd know them anywhere.

197
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:01,615
C-cups to be precise.

198
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:02,683
Oh, look at these.

199
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:03,951
CHLOE:
Please don't...

200
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,654
juggle the evidence, Lucifer.

201
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:08,622
(Lucifer sighs)
But it's fine if
he does, 'cause,

202
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:09,657
you know,
they've already been processed.

203
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,959
LUCIFER: They're called
"fun bags" for a reason.

204
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,261
Actually, this one is
a calf implant, so you should

205
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:15,629
have that,
Detective Douche.

206
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:16,964
Looks like
you've been skipping leg day.

207
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:20,033
Yeah, they're very, um,
low quality, actually.

208
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:21,101
More outdated

209
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:23,270
than Dan's flip phone.

210
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:24,638
Don't think any

211
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:26,006
surgeon in L.A. would use these.

212
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,941
CHLOE: Hmm. Okay.
We'll look into it.

213
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:30,143
Lucifer, he does this.

214
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:33,814
He notices things
that normal people are too...

215
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,683
normal to notice,

216
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:36,817
but it, uh,

217
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,318
has a tendency of paying off.

218
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,653
It does.
(clicks tongue)

219
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:40,520
DAN:
Why would he do this

220
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:42,155
to someone
who values natural beauty?

221
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,657
To punish her?

222
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:45,325
Well, that is
a very good question, Daniel,

223
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,827
but as an expert in punishment,

224
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,895
because I'm the Devil...

225
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:49,663
Hmm.
...this isn't punishment.

226
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:50,564
This looks like

227
00:08:50,598 --> 00:08:52,833
someone making a statement.

228
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,168
Well, maybe you're right.

229
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:56,837
Needle mark on the lip,

230
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,973
bruising around the injection.
This wasn't postmortem.

231
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:02,676
Poppy wasn't as all-natural as
she wanted everyone to believe.

232
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,944
She's a fraud.

233
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:06,714
Someone wanted

234
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:08,749
to reveal that the people
around her can't trust her.

235
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:11,018
Ah.

236
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,586
If that's the case,
I've seen this before.

237
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,689
Oh, very good.
Go, Reese Lightning.

238
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:16,990
(laughs)

239
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:19,359
CHLOE:
So, Daniel Moore, vegan chef.

240
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,161
Curiously found with
raw meat in his mouth.

241
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:24,231
Ah. So vegans can't enjoy
a healthy sex life? (laughs)

242
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:26,900
Tough crowd.

243
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:28,702
Turns out, he
owns a cattle ranch

244
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:31,004
in Montana, and the
environmentalist who was found

245
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:33,774
drowned in jet fuel, he
actually owned a private plane.

246
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:35,776
So, someone's killing
charlatans. Ah.

247
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,711
The worst kind of scum.

248
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:39,079
Next to boy bands.

249
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:41,014
All three victims
had trace amounts of

250
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:42,750
the exact same poison
in their system.

251
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:44,351
Same profile, same M.O.

252
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:46,720
This is a serial killer.

253
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:48,722
Yes. The Completely Justified
Killer of Phonies.

254
00:09:48,756 --> 00:09:50,624
If that's what you name him,
I want credit.

255
00:09:50,658 --> 00:09:53,226
The first scene was
found over a month ago.

256
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,762
Mm-hmm.

257
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:56,730
The environmentalist,
a week ago.

258
00:09:56,764 --> 00:10:00,367
And Poppy here was found
just a few days later.

259
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,203
I think the killer is
becoming more obsessed.

260
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:05,038
He's accelerating
his timeline.

261
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:07,908
We have to catch this guy
before anyone else dies.

262
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,176
Why does Lucifer work with you?

263
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,914
CHLOE:
I told you, it's an...

264
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,415
unconventional partnership,
and it just...

265
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,750
That's not it.

266
00:10:16,784 --> 00:10:18,151
What's he get out of it?

267
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:21,855
You'll have to ask him.

268
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:41,809
Hi, hon.

269
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:44,945
I know you've been avoiding me.

270
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:48,081
I mean, things have
been... off lately.

271
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:52,285
But I want to try
and turn things around.

272
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:55,322
Can we talk?

273
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:57,958
I miss you.

274
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,903
Leave Lucifer Morningstar alone.

275
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,973
Or you'll be too dead
to regret it.

276
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,708
I'm onto something, aren't I?

277
00:11:14,742 --> 00:11:15,943
You can't scare me off.

278
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:17,410
I've been threatened
by worse than you.

279
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:21,815
I guarantee you haven't.

280
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:23,717
(grunts)

281
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,332
Oh, Mr. Getty.

282
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,201
I need you to look up
this address.

283
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:42,836
Something shady

284
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,838
going on here.
O-Okay, but there's, uh...

285
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:46,506
Got to be a drug den,
human trafficking...

286
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,508
Mr. Getty, your wife's
in your office.

287
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,877
Really?

288
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,278
My wife?

289
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,848
How do I look?

290
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:56,850
Uh...

291
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:58,118
(sighs)

292
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,860
Reese.

293
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:08,461
We need to talk.

294
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:12,933
Linda.

295
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:15,769
You look... wow.

296
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:19,006
We should go to dinner.

297
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,908
Our favorite Italian
place is still open.

298
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:22,409
I'll make reservations.

299
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:25,813
Reese, why are people in your
office calling me your wife?

300
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:28,348
Because you are my wife.

301
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:30,317
No. We're separated.

302
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:34,454
It's been two years.

303
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,456
That's actually why I'm here.

304
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:40,828
I have been more
than patient, but it's time.

305
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:48,902
Sign the divorce papers, please.

306
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:53,206
(sighs) Is this because
you're seeing someone else?

307
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,543
No. No, this isn't because
I'm seeing someone, Reese.

308
00:12:56,576 --> 00:13:00,914
You can't keep leaving me
voicemails like that.

309
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:04,517
Things are not "off lately,"
things are over.

310
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:06,553
You need to move on.

311
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:09,056
I can't move on.

312
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:11,391
Don't you know
how much I love you?

313
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:14,828
You never give up.

314
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:17,797
It's one of the reasons
I fell in love with you.

315
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,134
But that was a long time ago.

316
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:23,070
Not that long ago.

317
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:24,404
This is classic denial.

318
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:26,139
It's a self-defense mechanism
that you...

319
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:27,307
Don't analyze me, Linda.

320
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:30,410
Sorry.

321
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:35,315
We're over.

322
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:39,286
Sign them.

323
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:45,258
I'm working on something,
and I need a little more time.

324
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:49,096
Why? Nothing you're working on
is gonna change anything.

325
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:50,597
24 hours, that's all
I'm asking for.

326
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,600
Okay, if I do...

327
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:56,069
you'll finally sign the papers?

328
00:13:56,103 --> 00:13:57,871
I promise.

329
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:15,889
Hey. Did you find anything
about that address yet?

330
00:14:15,923 --> 00:14:17,891
It's a known hot spot
for trading stolen goods.

331
00:14:17,925 --> 00:14:19,126
I knew he was up to something.

332
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,627
Fencing? Smuggling? Or worse?

333
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,962
Well, I can do some research
on the building.

334
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:23,163
No, I need proof right now.

335
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:26,033
Lucifer's duffel bag.

336
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:28,301
I need to get it.

337
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:31,438
* Just keep telling yourself
there's no shame *

338
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,974
* They don't know
'bout who we are *

339
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:37,210
* They don't know
'bout you and I *

340
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:42,582
* They ain't know 'bout
the stars of your eyes *

341
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:47,988
* Hot blood love
is gonna get you *

342
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:54,494
(elevator bell dings)

343
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:01,501
(scoffs)
Another piano?

344
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:07,274
(woman whimpers)

345
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:12,079
(whimpering continues)

346
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:18,585
REESE:
What the... ?

347
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:21,321
Uh, uh, don't worry.

348
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:23,023
I'm gonna get you out of here.

349
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:24,424
(whimpers)

350
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:26,359
LUCIFER:
Well, hello.

351
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:27,594
What the hell are you
doing here?

352
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:30,497
Well, it appears I've caught you
sneaking into my penthouse.

353
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,699
So perhaps you should
answer that question.

354
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:37,204
What story are you really
looking for, reporter?

355
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:39,039
I'm gonna expose you
for the fraud you are.

356
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:40,007
(laughs)

357
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,074
And save this woman.

358
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:42,342
Don't you try and stop me.

359
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,177
I won't. She
might, though.

360
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:46,379
Who is this guy, Lucifer?

361
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:48,081
He doesn't seem very fun.

362
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:50,350
REESE: You're not tied up
against your will?

363
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:52,152
Um, no.

364
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:53,353
I'm pretty into this.

365
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:55,055
At least I was
until you got here.

366
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:57,057
All right, that
doesn't matter.

367
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,691
I know I'm onto something.

368
00:15:58,725 --> 00:16:01,694
Otherwise, why would you send
that crazy ninja woman after me?

369
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:04,097
Crazy ninja wom-- oh, Maze?

370
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:05,065
No, I didn't send her.

371
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:07,567
She's just a tad
overprotective, that's all.

372
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,003
Demon bartenders,
you know how they can be.

373
00:16:10,037 --> 00:16:11,638
What about that pile of cash
I saw you give that cop?

374
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:13,240
Yes, to buy his duffel bag.

375
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:15,042
Hard to find
quality leather

376
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:16,243
with such tensile strength.

377
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:17,144
The bag.

378
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:19,112
That's right.

379
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:21,048
This will prove everything.

380
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:22,282
What is this?

381
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:28,655
Are these sex toys?

382
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:29,756
LUCIFER:
Edible sex toys,

383
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:31,091
to be precise.

384
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:32,592
Not exactly FDA approved,

385
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,094
so I had to sneak
the delicious things

386
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:35,495
through customs.

387
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:37,497
How could I be so wrong?

388
00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:41,434
About so many things?

389
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:43,103
(sighs)

390
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:45,605
Look, I know why
you're upset.

391
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:49,676
You thought you had a nice,
juicy scoop for your paper.

392
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:52,579
And I don't blame you.
You're just doing your job.

393
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:55,482
Unfortunately for you,
the only juicy thing here

394
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,650
is the, uh...
Watermelon Willies.

395
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:58,585
(chuckles)

396
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:00,287
They're pretty good.
You should try one.

397
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,788
Mm.
I'm allergic to watermelon.

398
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:07,160
Oh. Look, why don't
you come with me?

399
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:08,628
The detective just called
with some sort of lead.

400
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:11,064
I always find
catching a killer cheers me up.

401
00:17:11,098 --> 00:17:13,266
I mean, I was gonna
do Veronica first, but...

402
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,667
you don't mind waiting,
do you, darling?

403
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,136
Not at all.
Good.

404
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:17,170
Come on.

405
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:19,139
Excuse me.

406
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:20,240
Do you mind?

407
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:26,179
(muffled):
Thank you.

408
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:27,647
CHLOE: You were right
about the implants.

409
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,151
They were pulled from the market
years ago due to rupturing.

410
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:33,720
Oh, a moment of silence for all
those poor, mishandled breasts.

411
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:35,722
CHLOE: They're illegal
to sell anywhere,

412
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:37,557
but we pulled a
partial serial number

413
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,159
that pointed to a
plastic surgeon's office

414
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:40,727
in Beverly Hills.

415
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,230
Wait, you, Scarface?

416
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:48,168
You resent your clients,
don't you?

417
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:49,602
I don't...
You want them to suffer.

418
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:52,672
I do.

419
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:55,308
I want all of them to suffer.

420
00:17:55,342 --> 00:17:57,210
DAN:
Good work on the case.

421
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:58,745
Realizing
that his scar

422
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:01,681
made him resent other
people around him...

423
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:03,350
that was good.

424
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:05,252
Good detective work.

425
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:06,853
CHLOE:
Reese, you okay?

426
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:08,221
Reese.

427
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:12,192
REESE:
You were right.

428
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:13,293
About?

429
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:17,597
I wanted to write a piece that
showed that your partnership

430
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,432
was a dangerous joke.

431
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:22,602
That Lucifer was a fraud.

432
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:24,837
But the truth is

433
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:28,508
he's just frustratingly,
annoyingly...

434
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:29,876
a charming guy.

435
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:32,612
And you and him...

436
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:36,416
(sighs) you two work
well together.

437
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,318
There's no story here.

438
00:18:38,351 --> 00:18:39,852
I'm just gonna drop it.

439
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:41,388
Is this some weird
journalist tactic

440
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:42,855
to get me to
lower my guard?

441
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:43,856
I wish.

442
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,525
No, this is just me
getting out of the way,

443
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:47,460
so you can do your job.

444
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:48,895
Catch more killers.

445
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:51,198
CHLOE: Unfortunately,
Barry's not our killer.

446
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:53,400
He sold expired
medical goods

447
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:55,735
from the office,
including some tainted Botox

448
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:57,337
that poisoned a few people.

449
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,205
And although

450
00:18:58,238 --> 00:18:59,939
he'll spend a very
long time in jail,

451
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,241
he's not our guy.

452
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:02,475
But if he sold supplies
to the killer,

453
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:04,211
he should
know something.

454
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:06,313
Well, he wouldn't give us
any information on the buyer.

455
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:08,481
Probably scared, but
we'll get it out of him.

456
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:11,384
Detective, the lieutenant's
asking for you.

457
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:12,452
Okay.

458
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:13,453
Uh, excuse me.

459
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,288
Be right back.

460
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:16,356
Thank you.

461
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:22,829
LUCIFER:
Right.

462
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:24,831
Now the detective's gone,
let's have a chat.

463
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:26,599
Just the two
of us, shall we?

464
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:28,668
BARRY: Look, I don't
know anything, okay?

465
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:30,303
Yes, yes, you plead ignorance,

466
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:32,405
and then we sweat you until
you finally give us a name.

467
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:34,374
I'm sorry, I don't
have time for that.

468
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:36,243
I've got a lovely lady
tied up back at my place.

469
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:37,910
So I'd like to speed things up.

470
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:38,878
(Barry yells)

471
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:43,950
BARRY:
Listen, listen, man,

472
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:46,286
I-- wait...
(stammers)

473
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,320
Please stop! I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!

474
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:48,154
I don't know his name!

475
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,623
I only know his,
his username, okay?!

476
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:52,459
"TruthDog21"!

477
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:54,361
Please! Stop!
(cries)

478
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:56,363
Oh, oh!

479
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:00,367
(panting):
Oh.

480
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:17,917
Oh...

481
00:20:21,988 --> 00:20:23,222
(gasps)

482
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:31,498
You have to stop seeing
Lucifer Morningstar.

483
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:33,333
How did you get that name?

484
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:34,667
Uh...
Okay, invading my privacy

485
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:36,035
is one thing,

486
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,404
but if you're stalking
my clients...

487
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:38,471
I'm not stalking him.

488
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:40,840
I was working on a story
with him.

489
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:43,710
Oh, okay, so you just happened
to be working on a story

490
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:44,844
with Lucifer.

491
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:46,513
Okay, I know
this sounds crazy, it...

492
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:48,981
He's the Devil.

493
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:50,583
And I-I don't
mean in-in a,

494
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:52,018
in a douchebag,
club-owning kind of way.

495
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:54,020
I mean...

496
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:55,087
he's the actual Devil.

497
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:59,459
Yes, Lucifer is insistent
on this Devil persona.

498
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:00,460
No, he isn't some patient.

499
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:02,762
That's just a ploy that
he used to seduce you.

500
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:06,366
Okay, so that's
what this is about.

501
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:07,767
It is none of
your business

502
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,436
who I sleep with.

503
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:11,270
It is if it's Satan himself.

504
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:16,042
I don't think you've understood
exactly what it is you're doing.

505
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:18,411
Oh, I know exactly
what I'm doing.

506
00:21:19,546 --> 00:21:20,613
I'm enjoying myself with someone

507
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:22,715
who doesn't make me
feel trapped.

508
00:21:24,651 --> 00:21:26,386
Lucifer is someone who is

509
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:29,422
completely present
in the moment.

510
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:31,891
Who gives me 100%
of his attention.

511
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:34,394
And doesn't demand
anything from me.

512
00:21:34,427 --> 00:21:36,363
I guess if you want
to vilify him

513
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:38,431
and call him the Devil...

514
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:39,332
No, he is the Devil.

515
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,736
But being with him

516
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:48,040
is the most liberating
experience of my life.

517
00:21:48,074 --> 00:21:50,543
I see, he's-he's got you
under some sort of spell.

518
00:21:50,577 --> 00:21:54,581
You know, I've been
incredibly patient with you,

519
00:21:54,614 --> 00:21:58,084
because I still care about you,

520
00:21:58,117 --> 00:22:01,087
still worry about you.

521
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,523
But I just can't take it
anymore.

522
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:05,558
Okay, if I can come up with
proof that he is the Devil...

523
00:22:05,592 --> 00:22:07,594
Sign the papers!

524
00:22:16,102 --> 00:22:18,671
You've got a lot
you need to figure out, Reese.

525
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,976
You're right.

526
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,345
I do.

527
00:22:36,556 --> 00:22:38,491
*

528
00:22:47,434 --> 00:22:49,869
* La la, no, no, no

529
00:22:49,902 --> 00:22:52,505
* La la,
no, no, no *

530
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:53,973
* La la, no, no, no

531
00:22:54,006 --> 00:22:56,509
* Nah-no, nah-no,
no, no, no, no *

532
00:22:56,543 --> 00:23:01,981
* Keep my head down,
burn underneath the sun *

533
00:23:02,014 --> 00:23:04,517
* Caked in coarse ground

534
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:06,586
* Skin, leather-baking brown

535
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:09,789
* You better roll with it

536
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:12,158
* Bury the guilt

537
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:13,926
* Underneath the sun

538
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:20,166
* Keep my head down

539
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:23,002
* Shovel beyond the throes

540
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:25,672
* Devil's whistlin' now

541
00:23:25,705 --> 00:23:27,540
* We are what even knows

542
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:30,610
* You better roll with it

543
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:33,012
* Bury the guilt

544
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:36,683
* Underneath the sun

545
00:23:36,716 --> 00:23:38,585
* Nah-no, nah-no,
no, no, no, no, no *

546
00:23:38,618 --> 00:23:40,019
* No, no, no, no, no

547
00:23:40,052 --> 00:23:41,454
* La la, no, no, no

548
00:23:41,488 --> 00:23:42,689
* La la,
no, no, no *

549
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:44,824
* La la, no, no, no

550
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:46,192
* La la,
no, no, no *

551
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:49,662
* La la,
no, no, no. *

552
00:23:49,696 --> 00:23:53,032
(knocking)

553
00:23:56,569 --> 00:23:58,571
CHLOE:
Reese?

554
00:23:58,605 --> 00:24:00,573
It's Detective Decker.

555
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:02,609
We could really
use your help.

556
00:24:02,642 --> 00:24:04,477
(sighs)

557
00:24:11,918 --> 00:24:13,653
How can I help you, Detective?

558
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:15,655
Shower and a shave,
maybe. (chuckles)

559
00:24:15,688 --> 00:24:18,591
We're here about the serial
killer case from last year.

560
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:19,859
I thought
the killer went dormant.

561
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:21,093
He has,

562
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:24,230
but we're still investigating
the case, and we've had a break.

563
00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:25,565
All the victims were

564
00:24:25,598 --> 00:24:26,899
local celebrities
who were featured

565
00:24:26,933 --> 00:24:28,601
in the Telegraph's
style section.

566
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:29,902
You think he read the article?

567
00:24:29,936 --> 00:24:31,638
And we hope he commented
on them. We have a handle

568
00:24:31,671 --> 00:24:34,240
we think he used, TruthDog21.

569
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:36,576
Well, the comments are public.
You can search them.
We have.

570
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:38,578
We didn't find anything,
but we want...

571
00:24:38,611 --> 00:24:40,580
But I was complaining
to the detective

572
00:24:40,613 --> 00:24:42,615
about some posts of mine
that have been removed

573
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:45,084
from a web site for roosters
of award-winning size.

574
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:46,719
(laughs): You see, I was
posting pictures of my...

575
00:24:46,753 --> 00:24:47,887
CHLOE:
Okay.

576
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,056
Okay.

577
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:54,093
Does your paper archive
redacted comments?

578
00:24:54,126 --> 00:24:56,663
Uh, anything that's threatening
or violent.

579
00:24:56,696 --> 00:24:57,830
Or of award-winning size.

580
00:24:57,864 --> 00:24:59,599
REESE:
Uh, yeah, sure.

581
00:24:59,632 --> 00:25:01,634
Just give the information
to my assistant.

582
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:04,170
He'll gather the info.
It might take a day or two.

583
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:06,606
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

584
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:08,775
(both chuckle)

585
00:25:10,643 --> 00:25:12,278
You still haven't
destroyed him, have you?

586
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:13,613
Excuse me?

587
00:25:13,646 --> 00:25:15,748
That sleazy piece of garbage

588
00:25:15,782 --> 00:25:17,617
who was sleeping
with your wife.

589
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,118
No.

590
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:20,653
I'm starting to think

591
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:23,756
that he might be undestroyable.
(chuckles)

592
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:25,124
Well, perhaps you're not

593
00:25:25,157 --> 00:25:27,259
thinking outside the box
enough, Reesey.

594
00:25:27,293 --> 00:25:29,128
Don't be afraid to
take a big swing.

595
00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:30,597
It can be therapeutic.

596
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,298
Oh, speaking of...

597
00:25:32,331 --> 00:25:36,135
(groans) I'm late
for my own therapy. Again.

598
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:38,070
(chuckles)
She's gonna kill me.

599
00:25:52,785 --> 00:25:54,621
She said that was
a ridiculous idea...

600
00:25:54,654 --> 00:25:56,656
Linda.
LUCIFER AND LINDA: Reese.

601
00:25:56,689 --> 00:25:58,791
What, you know him as well?

602
00:25:58,825 --> 00:26:01,327
My ex-husband, Reese...
Linda.

603
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,062
Stay back.
Your ex-husband?

604
00:26:03,095 --> 00:26:05,297
So we're tunnel buddies.

605
00:26:05,331 --> 00:26:06,198
Hey.
(gun cocks)

606
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,141
You realize what
you just did?

607
00:26:16,843 --> 00:26:19,145
You just ruined
a perfectly good Burberry.

608
00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:21,080
What kind of monster
are you?
REESE: See?

609
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:23,716
He's the Devil! I told you.
Y-You tried to kill him.

610
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,918
Yeah, but I didn't.
He's invincible because
he's the Devil.

611
00:26:25,952 --> 00:26:27,887
See? There's your proof.
Reese...

612
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,888
You're lucky the detective
isn't here.

613
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:30,890
You'd be cleaning my blood
out of the couch.

614
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,625
Put the gun down, Reese.

615
00:26:32,659 --> 00:26:34,293
Right, I don't need it anymore.
Look, I...

616
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:37,730
I know it's a lot to process,

617
00:26:37,764 --> 00:26:39,265
but you've got to believe me.

618
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:40,767
Reese, I know he's the Devil.

619
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,401
What?

620
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:45,404
You... you... you do?

621
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,740
Is this what you were trying to
tell me all those months ago?

622
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:51,410
(gasps)
I saw his real face.

623
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,645
If you see it,
then you'll know.

624
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:53,646
I have seen it.

625
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,914
And I know.

626
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,783
I know

627
00:26:56,816 --> 00:26:58,350
how unsettling
it can be.
LUCIFER: Yes.

628
00:26:58,384 --> 00:26:59,719
And if you're
this unsettled by me,

629
00:26:59,752 --> 00:27:00,820
I'd hate to see
what you're gonna do

630
00:27:00,853 --> 00:27:02,088
to the scoundrel who's
been sleeping

631
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:03,355
with your wife.

632
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:05,191
LINDA:
I'm so sorry.

633
00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:07,660
I didn't realize
what you were going through.

634
00:27:08,895 --> 00:27:11,931
I didn't know the truth,

635
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:13,866
and I didn't think
you did either.

636
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,268
But you know now.

637
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:17,804
And you're still seeing him?

638
00:27:17,837 --> 00:27:19,839
LUCIFER:
Only professionally, Reese,

639
00:27:19,872 --> 00:27:20,773
much to my disappointment.

640
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:25,011
When I first learned
who he really was, it...

641
00:27:25,044 --> 00:27:27,680
(sighs) it-it turned my
world upside down.

642
00:27:28,848 --> 00:27:30,683
But he's not
what you think.

643
00:27:30,717 --> 00:27:31,550
He's the Devil!

644
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:32,985
Oh, it's not like I've
hidden that fact.

645
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:34,954
He's evil incarnate!
No.

646
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:38,190
No, he's a good man.

647
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,762
He's my friend.

648
00:27:44,897 --> 00:27:48,300
All this time I've been...

649
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:51,838
trying to prove to you
who he really is.

650
00:27:51,871 --> 00:27:53,172
And not only

651
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:56,843
did you already know...

652
00:27:56,876 --> 00:27:57,777
you didn't care.

653
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,779
Sit down, Reese, let's
talk this through.

654
00:27:59,812 --> 00:28:00,780
No, no.
Please, Reese.

655
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:11,157
(knock on door)

656
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:14,060
Your assistant left
your redacted comments research

657
00:28:14,093 --> 00:28:16,362
on my desk.

658
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:20,867
Are you still working on
this nightclub owner thing?

659
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,169
He's not just
a nightclub owner.

660
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:26,038
So do you have a story for me,
something I can actually print,

661
00:28:26,072 --> 00:28:27,239
or just arts and crafts?

662
00:28:27,273 --> 00:28:28,374
This has to stop.

663
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:29,942
Now.
I can't.

664
00:28:31,477 --> 00:28:33,112
I can't let this guy win.

665
00:28:33,145 --> 00:28:35,047
You have filed, barely,

666
00:28:35,081 --> 00:28:37,349
a dozen other stories
this year.

667
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:39,218
And you have nothing to show
for all this work.

668
00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:41,320
Reese!
(sighs)

669
00:28:43,923 --> 00:28:46,392
This guy has won.

670
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:48,460
I'm telling you this
as your friend.

671
00:28:48,494 --> 00:28:49,595
If you don't

672
00:28:49,628 --> 00:28:52,298
let this go, it's going to be
the end of your career.

673
00:29:00,272 --> 00:29:02,208
* Are you ready
for the Devil, man? *

674
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:05,044
* Are you ready for
the Devil, man? *

675
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:08,948
* Are you ready
for the Devil? *

676
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:10,850
* Are you ready
for the Devil, man?

677
00:29:10,883 --> 00:29:12,985
* Are you ready for the Devil?

678
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:25,331
* Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha

679
00:29:33,973 --> 00:29:36,008
LUCIFER (echoing): You're lucky
the detective isn't here.

680
00:29:36,042 --> 00:29:37,810
You'd be cleaning my blood
out of the couch.

681
00:29:37,844 --> 00:29:40,813
* No mercy, no mercy

682
00:29:43,482 --> 00:29:45,952
* Are you ready
for the Devil, man? *

683
00:29:45,985 --> 00:29:48,520
* Are you ready for
the Devil? *

684
00:29:48,554 --> 00:29:51,157
* Are you ready
for the Devil, man? *

685
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,794
(knocks)

686
00:30:05,004 --> 00:30:07,173
Alvin Kapitski?
Yeah.

687
00:30:07,206 --> 00:30:09,308
Registered on the
LA Telegraph web site

688
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:11,210
as "TruthDog21"?

689
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:14,013
I wanted to ask you
a few questions

690
00:30:14,046 --> 00:30:15,614
about some comments
that you posted

691
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,117
on some stories we ran
about Poppy Parker

692
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,285
and Daniel Moore.

693
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,988
Okay.

694
00:30:22,021 --> 00:30:23,355
Okay.

695
00:30:25,524 --> 00:30:28,360
I knew this day would come.

696
00:30:28,394 --> 00:30:30,129
I'll surrender quietly.

697
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:31,230
Oh, no.

698
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:32,899
I'm not a cop.

699
00:30:32,932 --> 00:30:34,867
I'm a reporter.

700
00:30:34,901 --> 00:30:36,903
I just want to
talk to you.

701
00:30:38,905 --> 00:30:41,140
You're here to
do a story on me?

702
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:44,543
Well, my job is to
dig up the truth.

703
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:47,179
Expose people for
who they really are.

704
00:30:47,213 --> 00:30:49,015
And once I saw your work,

705
00:30:49,048 --> 00:30:50,950
I-I realized that

706
00:30:50,983 --> 00:30:53,019
you were just doing
the same thing.
Yeah.

707
00:30:53,052 --> 00:30:54,453
Yeah, I was.

708
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:58,024
I'm back on my meds now.

709
00:30:58,057 --> 00:31:00,092
I'm trying to be good.
It's hard, but I'm trying.

710
00:31:00,126 --> 00:31:02,028
I'm trying, I'm trying.
I get it.

711
00:31:02,061 --> 00:31:04,964
It's just, I met this guy

712
00:31:04,997 --> 00:31:06,498
recently.

713
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:09,368
Biggest fraud
I'd ever encountered.

714
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:11,203
Yeah?

715
00:31:11,237 --> 00:31:13,906
I tried to expose him,

716
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,608
show everybody the liar
that he really is.

717
00:31:18,077 --> 00:31:19,178
What happened?

718
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:21,180
He won.

719
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:24,583
They always do,
don't they?

720
00:31:27,086 --> 00:31:28,988
Unless someone does something.

721
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:38,097
What's his name?

722
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:40,967
(dance music playing)

723
00:31:43,102 --> 00:31:45,137
Hi.

724
00:31:45,171 --> 00:31:46,572
Thanks for coming.
Hey,

725
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:48,975
you're helping me,
so thanks.

726
00:31:49,008 --> 00:31:52,111
Although I have no idea
why we had to meet here.

727
00:31:52,144 --> 00:31:53,079
Those them?

728
00:31:53,112 --> 00:31:55,247
Yeah, uh,

729
00:31:55,281 --> 00:31:57,249
all the redacted
comments.

730
00:31:57,283 --> 00:32:00,219
*

731
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:03,055
Uh, but first,

732
00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:04,656
I never did get
to interview you.

733
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:07,259
You know, you really
had me fooled.

734
00:32:07,293 --> 00:32:08,961
Thought you were different.

735
00:32:08,995 --> 00:32:11,330
Fine, ask away.

736
00:32:11,363 --> 00:32:12,999
What do you think
Lucifer gets

737
00:32:13,032 --> 00:32:14,333
out of this partnership?

738
00:32:16,168 --> 00:32:17,403
CHLOE:
You already asked me that.

739
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:20,406
Uh, but you never answered.

740
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:24,610
Um... I think,

741
00:32:24,643 --> 00:32:25,677
a long time ago,

742
00:32:25,711 --> 00:32:28,114
somebody wronged Lucifer.

743
00:32:28,147 --> 00:32:29,348
I think he avoided
dealing with it,

744
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:31,150
and he hides

745
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:33,052
behind the partying

746
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:36,188
and the women and the drinking,
and who knows what else.

747
00:32:36,222 --> 00:32:37,990
And with the LAPD,

748
00:32:38,024 --> 00:32:40,459
working on each case,
it gives him an opportunity

749
00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:42,594
to right those wrongs,
to fight back.

750
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:44,296
(chuckles):
Oh.

751
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:46,132
You think that's funny?

752
00:32:46,165 --> 00:32:48,134
Uh, no, no.
I'm sorry.

753
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:50,536
REESE:
I just think, uh,

754
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:52,304
you give him more credit

755
00:32:52,338 --> 00:32:54,106
than he deserves.

756
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,541
Well, I don't think
you give him enough.

757
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:57,443
* After the rain

758
00:32:57,476 --> 00:33:01,147
* Washes away our sins

759
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:06,652
* They never said that
love is a twisted game *

760
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:09,188
* And no one ever wins

761
00:33:09,221 --> 00:33:12,491
You may be right.

762
00:33:12,524 --> 00:33:14,326
* We've been here before

763
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,495
Thanks, Detective.

764
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:19,331
* You want something more

765
00:33:19,365 --> 00:33:21,300
* Lover, best friend

766
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,302
* My worst enemy

767
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:25,037
* You know I won't...

768
00:33:25,071 --> 00:33:26,305
CHLOE:
Um... (clears throat)

769
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:27,639
these, uh...

770
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:29,208
these look incomplete.

771
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:30,576
(woman screams)

772
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:33,079
WOMAN:
Help! Help, help!

773
00:33:34,213 --> 00:33:36,215
Help! Help!
Help! Help!

774
00:33:36,248 --> 00:33:38,084
(crowd murmuring)

775
00:33:44,156 --> 00:33:45,157
She's dead.

776
00:33:45,191 --> 00:33:47,159
(mouths)

777
00:33:47,193 --> 00:33:49,228
CHLOE:
What happened?

778
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:54,600
ELLA:
Yeah, you were right.

779
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:56,135
Looks like the same poison

780
00:33:56,168 --> 00:33:57,369
that was used by that
serial killer

781
00:33:57,403 --> 00:33:58,604
you guys were after.

782
00:33:58,637 --> 00:34:01,373
They did this under
my own roof.

783
00:34:01,407 --> 00:34:02,641
My home.

784
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:09,215
How-how could the killer
be here

785
00:34:09,248 --> 00:34:11,850
the exact same time we were?

786
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,820
Must be something,
must...

787
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:18,257
It must be you.

788
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:20,626
What?
What do you mean?

789
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:22,261
He was here for you.

790
00:34:22,294 --> 00:34:24,130
He must have figured out
that you were gonna

791
00:34:24,163 --> 00:34:26,265
pass over information
about him.

792
00:34:26,298 --> 00:34:28,100
I'm so sorry.

793
00:34:28,134 --> 00:34:29,268
This is... this is all my fault.

794
00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:31,103
I'm to blame.
I put you in danger.

795
00:34:31,137 --> 00:34:33,572
No, no, no,
this is not your fault.

796
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:35,841
There's only one person
who's to blame for this.

797
00:34:38,777 --> 00:34:39,778
Yeah.

798
00:34:49,621 --> 00:34:51,223
I'm in no mood for
whatever it is.

799
00:34:51,257 --> 00:34:52,591
You.

800
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:56,462
This is all your fault.

801
00:35:02,201 --> 00:35:04,803
You ruined my life.
You drove me to do things

802
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:05,804
I never would've done.

803
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:07,606
And now...

804
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:09,575
there's a dead girl
down there because of you.

805
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:12,144
What is it with you humans?

806
00:35:12,178 --> 00:35:14,280
Huh? Always blaming me.

807
00:35:14,313 --> 00:35:18,184
I never make any of you
do anything.

808
00:35:18,217 --> 00:35:19,551
That's not true.

809
00:35:19,585 --> 00:35:20,586
You trick us

810
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:21,753
into sin,

811
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:23,289
damnation.

812
00:35:23,322 --> 00:35:25,324
(sighs)

813
00:35:25,357 --> 00:35:27,826
I have a story for you,
reporter.

814
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:32,798
One I've never told
a human soul before.

815
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:35,901
I take no part
in who goes to Hell.

816
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:37,503
Then who does?

817
00:35:37,536 --> 00:35:38,904
You humans.

818
00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:40,939
(chuckles)
You send yourselves.

819
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,609
Driven down by your own guilt.

820
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,577
Forcing yourselves

821
00:35:45,611 --> 00:35:48,214
to relive your sins
over and over.

822
00:35:48,247 --> 00:35:49,881
And the best part...

823
00:35:51,317 --> 00:35:53,819
the doors aren't locked.

824
00:35:53,852 --> 00:35:55,687
You could leave anytime.

825
00:35:55,721 --> 00:35:57,289
It says something

826
00:35:57,323 --> 00:35:59,291
that no one ever does,
doesn't it?

827
00:35:59,325 --> 00:36:00,926
No.

828
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:01,893
You're to blame.

829
00:36:01,927 --> 00:36:05,331
I am responsible for
a lot of things, Reese,

830
00:36:05,364 --> 00:36:06,465
but not your soul,

831
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:07,799
not your actions,

832
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:10,969
and not whoever killed
that poor girl downstairs.

833
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,305
Eh, you...

834
00:36:13,339 --> 00:36:15,607
you have to be.

835
00:36:15,641 --> 00:36:16,708
Otherwise...

836
00:36:21,747 --> 00:36:24,750
Hurting me is not what you
really want to do, is it?

837
00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:29,321
What are you doing to me?

838
00:36:29,355 --> 00:36:32,358
Oh, you're a complicated one,
aren't you, Reese?

839
00:36:32,391 --> 00:36:33,325
Strong.

840
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,193
Tell me...

841
00:36:36,328 --> 00:36:39,331
what do you truly desire?

842
00:36:39,365 --> 00:36:41,267
I...

843
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,505
I just want Linda to love me.

844
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:48,974
(knife drops)

845
00:36:49,007 --> 00:36:50,642
You're still in love
with your ex?

846
00:36:50,676 --> 00:36:51,810
What about your wife?

847
00:36:51,843 --> 00:36:53,312
She is my wife.

848
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,349
She'll always be my wife.

849
00:36:57,383 --> 00:36:59,285
So... hold on,

850
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:01,653
that-that sleazy,
piece of garbage, that...

851
00:37:01,687 --> 00:37:04,290
(chuckles)
that was me?

852
00:37:04,323 --> 00:37:06,425
(laughs)

853
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:08,760
It was me.

854
00:37:08,794 --> 00:37:10,362
The way she looks at you.

855
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:11,363
Ah...

856
00:37:11,397 --> 00:37:13,332
She cares for you.

857
00:37:13,365 --> 00:37:16,368
How'd you do that?

858
00:37:16,402 --> 00:37:21,673
How did you convince her
that the Devil, of all people...

859
00:37:21,707 --> 00:37:23,008
was good?

860
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:26,412
I don't know.

861
00:37:26,445 --> 00:37:29,715
I just...
showed her my true self.

862
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:33,352
But how could she
accept you after that?

863
00:37:33,385 --> 00:37:37,556
Well, maybe she did...
because of that.

864
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:39,057
(chuckles)

865
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,659
Hmm.

866
00:37:42,494 --> 00:37:44,430
Before you say anything,
hear me out.

867
00:37:44,463 --> 00:37:45,797
There's nothing
you can say.

868
00:37:45,831 --> 00:37:47,333
I was a bad husband.

869
00:37:47,366 --> 00:37:48,567
Put my work
above everything,

870
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,968
above us.

871
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:51,370
Our marriage failing

872
00:37:51,403 --> 00:37:52,571
was all my fault.

873
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:53,605
And I'm sorry.

874
00:37:58,477 --> 00:37:59,778
You deserved better.

875
00:38:02,481 --> 00:38:04,683
Well, if we're...
if we're being honest...

876
00:38:06,852 --> 00:38:10,088
it wasn't all
your fault.

877
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,657
I wasn't perfect either.

878
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:15,894
Truth is...

879
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:18,497
neither one of us could be
what the other one needed.

880
00:38:19,865 --> 00:38:20,932
That's why it's good

881
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:23,469
that we're going
our separate ways.

882
00:38:23,502 --> 00:38:25,837
But, Linda, no, no, I...

883
00:38:25,871 --> 00:38:29,007
I thought me opening up
would bring us closer.

884
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,843
Like it did with
you and Lucifer.

885
00:38:31,877 --> 00:38:33,579
Reese,

886
00:38:33,612 --> 00:38:35,013
that's not how this works.

887
00:38:36,682 --> 00:38:38,584
You forgave the Devil.

888
00:38:38,617 --> 00:38:39,951
Why can't you forgive me?

889
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:41,487
(scoffs)

890
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,522
You know, for a second,

891
00:38:43,555 --> 00:38:47,493
I thought that you were honestly
taking responsibility.

892
00:38:47,526 --> 00:38:50,462
But it's always the same
with you, over and over.

893
00:38:50,496 --> 00:38:53,465
So determined, you never listen,
never learn.

894
00:38:53,499 --> 00:38:54,466
Do you know
how much I love you?

895
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,468
The things that
I've done for you.

896
00:38:56,502 --> 00:38:57,636
I went up against the Devil.

897
00:38:57,669 --> 00:39:00,539
I risked everything getting
involved with a serial killer.

898
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:01,940
A poor girl got killed!

899
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:03,642
Wait, what?

900
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:04,976
I-I can explain...

901
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:05,977
Reese, what have you done?

902
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:07,513
No, it-it wasn't my fault.

903
00:39:07,546 --> 00:39:08,647
I'm calling the police.
No.

904
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,548
It was an accident.

905
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:11,850
I-I didn't mean for
any of this to happen.

906
00:39:13,452 --> 00:39:14,553
Reese.
Stop.

907
00:39:14,586 --> 00:39:16,488
Let me explain.
Reese, let go of me.

908
00:39:16,522 --> 00:39:17,489
Reese.
No, no!

909
00:39:17,523 --> 00:39:19,925
No!
Reese, no!

910
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:24,563
Oh, God.
I'm sorry.

911
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,969
You're right.

912
00:39:31,002 --> 00:39:32,571
Call Detective Decker.

913
00:39:32,604 --> 00:39:34,573
Tell them they can
find me at my office.

914
00:39:34,606 --> 00:39:38,677
I'll give them everything
that I have on Kapitski.

915
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,912
And I'll turn myself in.

916
00:39:40,946 --> 00:39:42,080
I'm sorry.

917
00:39:45,617 --> 00:39:47,853
You were right.

918
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:49,187
Let me make this right.

919
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,557
Good-bye, Reese.

920
00:40:01,467 --> 00:40:02,568
(sighs)

921
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:05,136
(sighs)

922
00:40:09,575 --> 00:40:10,876
(gags)

923
00:40:14,546 --> 00:40:17,849
KAPITSKI: You sent me
to kill the wrong man.

924
00:40:17,883 --> 00:40:20,051
Lucifer wasn't a fraud.
(glass drops)

925
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:21,587
He's an honest man.

926
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,688
As honest as they come.

927
00:40:22,721 --> 00:40:25,724
No, no, the fraud is you!

928
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:28,226
(gags)
Reporter
lying to people.

929
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,796
A coward trying to get another
man to do his dirty work.

930
00:40:30,829 --> 00:40:32,564
You're the one
who deserves to go next.

931
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:36,568
And now you will.

932
00:40:36,602 --> 00:40:38,604
(laughs)

933
00:40:38,637 --> 00:40:39,905
What are you laughing about?

934
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:41,907
I caught you.

935
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,609
(siren chirps)

936
00:40:43,642 --> 00:40:44,576
Crap!

937
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:46,512
(both grunting)
Let go! No!

938
00:40:46,545 --> 00:40:47,613
(wheezes)

939
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:54,920
Stay down.
(handcuffs tighten)

940
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:58,490
(Reese wheezing)

941
00:41:02,628 --> 00:41:05,631
(Reese gasping)

942
00:41:05,664 --> 00:41:07,533
Oh, Reesey.

943
00:41:07,566 --> 00:41:09,501
You laying down on the job?

944
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,071
Don't tell me, asthma.

945
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:15,140
That...

946
00:41:15,173 --> 00:41:17,475
or the poison I drank.

947
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,546
(Lucifer scoffs)

948
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:23,749
Well...

949
00:41:23,782 --> 00:41:25,651
you didn't drink all of it.

950
00:41:25,684 --> 00:41:26,652
(siren approaching)

951
00:41:26,685 --> 00:41:29,588
I set things right.

952
00:41:29,621 --> 00:41:33,191
Maybe this will
turn things around...

953
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:34,526
with Linda.

954
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,494
(wheezing continues)

955
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:49,040
(inhales deeply)

956
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:02,187
Welcome back to the land
of the living, Mr. Getty.

957
00:42:10,662 --> 00:42:13,298
What...

958
00:42:13,331 --> 00:42:14,666
what happened?

959
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,068
Just a little brush with death.

960
00:42:17,102 --> 00:42:19,671
You had us worried there
for a while.

961
00:42:19,705 --> 00:42:21,006
(groans softly)

962
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:25,711
Is my wife here?

963
00:42:26,845 --> 00:42:27,913
No.

964
00:42:29,214 --> 00:42:31,082
I'm sorry, you haven't
had any visitors.

965
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:34,820
Well...

966
00:42:34,853 --> 00:42:36,888
we have been having
some trouble lately.

967
00:42:39,758 --> 00:42:41,159
But you know what?

968
00:42:41,192 --> 00:42:43,094
Second chance on life.

969
00:42:43,128 --> 00:42:44,996
Maybe it's not too late
to turn things around.

970
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,965
* Hey!

971
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:55,874
* Hey! *
* I'm sick of seeing

972
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:58,677
* Your face so much

973
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:00,245
* Television's off

974
00:43:00,278 --> 00:43:03,014
* But you won't shut up

975
00:43:03,048 --> 00:43:06,718
* Hey! *
* Oh, oh

976
00:43:06,752 --> 00:43:07,953
* Give it up

977
00:43:15,393 --> 00:43:16,594
* Hey! *
