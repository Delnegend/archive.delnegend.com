00:00:01,602 --> 00:00:02,703
Previously on Lucifer...

2
00:00:02,736 --> 00:00:03,704
Kane is alive.

3
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:04,605
You know, for an immortal,

4
00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:06,006
you really do bleed a lot,
don't you?

5
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,676
PIERCE:
I still feel all the pain
that comes with death,

6
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:10,144
just the wounds heal.

7
00:00:10,178 --> 00:00:12,113
AMENADIEL:
I am a soldier of God.

8
00:00:12,146 --> 00:00:13,114
His favorite son.

9
00:00:13,147 --> 00:00:14,448
Oh, that's gonna be a thing,
isn't it?

10
00:00:14,482 --> 00:00:16,384
It was weird

11
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:18,286
seeing you and Amenadiel
so chummy.

12
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:20,421
It makes me feel left out.

13
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:22,556
I'm missing time.

14
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,426
It's like someone else
was living my life.

15
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:27,795
I've been pretending
like I remember it all

16
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:30,798
because otherwise, everyone
would think that I'm crazy.

17
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:32,400
My Dad screwed us both.

18
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:35,203
But perhaps there's a way
for us to screw Him back.

19
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:36,404
If we're gonna kill you,

20
00:00:36,437 --> 00:00:38,106
we have got to do it together.

21
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,311
("The Answer" by Aquamoan
playing)

22
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,418
* I'll be *

23
00:00:50,451 --> 00:00:55,123
* The answer

24
00:00:57,225 --> 00:00:59,093
* Ah, ah, ah, ah...

25
00:00:59,127 --> 00:01:00,561
What do you got for me?

26
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:02,563
* Ah, ah, ah, ah

27
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:03,764
* Ah, ah, ah, ah...

28
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:09,737
(phone ringing)

29
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:10,704
I said no phone.

30
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:11,839
Sorry.

31
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:12,840
Thought I turned it off.

32
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:14,308
It's just my sister.

33
00:01:14,342 --> 00:01:15,543
The cops are calling you?

34
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,179
Your sister's a cop?

35
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:19,480
She works in forensics.

36
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:20,714
Trust me, okay?
Just...

37
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:22,416
put the gun down.

38
00:01:24,618 --> 00:01:26,187
(phone beeps)

39
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,589
Come on, Jay, I'm your sister.

40
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:30,858
I'm not supposed to have to
leave a message after the beep,

41
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:32,526
you're supposed to call me back.

42
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,495
(beeps)

43
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,368
LUCIFER:
Take off your shirt.

44
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:42,870
Don't flatter yourself.

45
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:46,607
In my quest to help you die,
I've done some research,

46
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,609
and I think the key
may lie in understanding

47
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:49,710
the mark
that my Father placed on you.

48
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:51,912
Oh, that's a waste of time.
I've already tried

49
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,481
to figure out what it means.

50
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:55,883
I've read every book, I've
analyzed every language.

51
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,818
Well, have you ever let
the Devil take a gander?

52
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:00,621
Didn't think so.

53
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:02,923
(sighs)
Okay.

54
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,892
Well, where's the rest of it?
The tattoo on top.

55
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:06,794
The skull and the spears.

56
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:07,828
Well, my body's
constantly healing.

57
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,897
I have to reapply the tattoo
every few months.

58
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,666
Well, why bother at all?

59
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,935
Because it represents
my immortality, my curse.

60
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,537
I hate it.
Yes, yes.

61
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,272
You hate living forever
'cause you can't see

62
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:19,373
how much fun it is.

63
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:21,775
I'll never understand you.

64
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:22,776
What?

65
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,278
Do you have something?

66
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:29,517
Seriously?
Well, it's worth a try.

67
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,519
God, this was much easier
in The DVC.

68
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,520
DVC?

69
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:34,655
My research text.
Also a movie.

70
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:37,658
By the way, Tom Hanks
is a national treasure.

71
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:39,927
Also a movie.
Not as helpful, though.

72
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,530
Your research was watching
The Da Vinci Code?

73
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:43,597
And the sequels.
No offense, Lucifer,

74
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:45,966
but I don't think
this is in your wheelhouse.

75
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,668
You're right.

76
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,337
Amenadiel's the brainy one.

77
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,838
We should ask him.

78
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:52,673
That's a good idea.
You think he'll help?

79
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:54,808
Well, we've grown
much closer, he and I.

80
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:57,311
I'll convince him.

81
00:02:57,345 --> 00:02:59,513
*

82
00:03:07,255 --> 00:03:09,290
En garde!

83
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:11,559
(English accent): Oh, no!
No, no, no, please. Please,

84
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:13,294
don't harm me,
fierce warrior.

85
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:15,429
I-I-I surrender!

86
00:03:15,463 --> 00:03:16,830
I will spare your life.

87
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,399
This time.

88
00:03:20,468 --> 00:03:22,603
We're wearing the same shirt!

89
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:25,806
Sushi shirt!
Sushi shirt!

90
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:28,842
Come on in.

91
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:29,977
MAZE: I don't know
what's going on out there,

92
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:30,978
but I hate it!

93
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:33,614
(grunting)

94
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,851
Oh.

95
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:38,852
Hey, Ellen.

96
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:40,988
It's Ella.
(grunts)

97
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:41,822
Decker's not here.

98
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:45,859
I'm, um, actually looking
for you.

99
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:48,496
(grunts, panting)

100
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,864
Trix,

101
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:53,867
sever
their Achilles first.

102
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,469
If they can't walk,

103
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:56,870
they can't betray you.
They can't betray you.

104
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:57,871
Got it.

105
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:59,740
Okay.

106
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:01,008
What's up?

107
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:05,379
Um, well, my brother
came into town yesterday,

108
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:06,747
and I can't

109
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,416
get ahold of him.
(grunts)

110
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:10,351
Good talk. See you later.

111
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:11,752
No, wait. I-It's not like him

112
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:13,621
to just disappear.

113
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:15,556
I can't find him.

114
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:16,557
Anywhere.

115
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,625
And everyone says

116
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:20,361
that you are the best
bounty hunter we've got.

117
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:22,396
Ah, so he's a criminal.

118
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,664
No. No, no, no, no.

119
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:26,767
But... I got a bad feeling.

120
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,769
Please, I need
your help.

121
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:29,603
I'll pay!

122
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:33,541
Next time, lead with that.

123
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,312
So, does that mean
you'll help me?

124
00:04:38,346 --> 00:04:39,447
AMENADIEL:
No.

125
00:04:41,549 --> 00:04:42,850
What do you mean, no?

126
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:44,952
God cursed Kane because
he killed his own brother.

127
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:46,520
And you want to
remove that curse,

128
00:04:46,554 --> 00:04:50,924
which God placed on him
for a very good reason.

129
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,393
Does that even sound

130
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:55,062
like something
that I would help you do?

131
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:57,798
Well, it did,
until you put it like that.

132
00:04:57,831 --> 00:05:01,469
Look, this is important to me,
Amenadiel.

133
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:03,404
I need your help.

134
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:04,938
Just take a look
at the mark, and maybe

135
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:07,074
it'll jog something
in that geeky brain of yours.

136
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:08,542
If Father wanted you
to understand Kane's mark,

137
00:05:08,576 --> 00:05:09,477
He simply would've...

138
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,345
Send my angelic brother down
to help me?

139
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:12,480
Nice try.

140
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:17,084
We've been through a lot,
you and I.

141
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:18,719
I thought we were getting along.

142
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:19,987
I thought we were...

143
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,089
well, brothers, for once.

144
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:23,090
We are, Luci.

145
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:24,958
But you're also my test.

146
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,828
The reason Father has placed me
here on Earth without my powers.

147
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:30,964
So I need to protect you
from yourself.
(sighs)

148
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:33,701
I gave my word, Brother.

149
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,569
That's not my problem.

150
00:05:35,603 --> 00:05:37,538
(elevator bell dings)

151
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:42,643
MAZE:
My sources say your brother

152
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,512
had a meeting here last night.

153
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:46,647
Really?
This place belongs
to a diamond dealer.

154
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,382
Fahrid Nasser.

155
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,683
Never heard of him.
But my brother

156
00:05:49,717 --> 00:05:52,453
is a diamond authenticator. I
mean, makes sense he'd be here.

157
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:54,121
(chuckles softly) Well,
apparently, this Fahrid guy,

158
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:55,856
real sketchy dude.

159
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,758
Okay, my brother is
literally the one

160
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,860
who determines
if diamonds are legit.

161
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:02,396
Okay? That's the polar
opposite of sketchy.

162
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,032
So if he was here,
he had his reasons.

163
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:15,142
No.

164
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:17,144
No, no, no. No.

165
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:19,913
(exhales)
Thank God.

166
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:23,617
I mean, too bad for
this dude, but...

167
00:06:23,651 --> 00:06:25,619
thank you, Big Guy.

168
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:27,054
Yeah. Huge relief.

169
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:28,522
Your brother's not dead.

170
00:06:28,556 --> 00:06:30,791
Instead, he might be
the killer.

171
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:36,730
*

172
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:45,038
(indistinct police transmission)

173
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:47,641
Can't believe you
called the cops.

174
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:48,909
Maze, for the last time,

175
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:51,512
stop telling people
not to call the cops.

176
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:53,046
ELLA: And why wouldn't
I call this in, okay?

177
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,081
Even if Jay

178
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:55,549
was here, he's innocent.

179
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,685
Which means he might have seen
who did this.

180
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:00,454
Wait, he might be in danger.

181
00:07:00,488 --> 00:07:01,722
Is this the brother
who steals cars?

182
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:02,856
Oh, no, Jay's the oldest.

183
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,459
And you know
how older brothers are.
LUCIFER: Yeah.

184
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:07,561
Oh. I'm an only child.
Oh.

185
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:09,096
Well, Jay is the good one.

186
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:10,931
The one we all looked up to.

187
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:13,100
I mean, I know
my family's got its issues,

188
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:14,835
but not Jay.

189
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:16,970
I mean,
he really made me believe

190
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:18,672
I could live a good life.

191
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:20,941
Mm, well, that's what eldest
brothers want you to think.

192
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:21,942
Always talking down to you

193
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:24,077
from their pedestals
that they put themselves on.

194
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:27,080
But when you need them
to help you kill someone...

195
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:29,817
(chuckles) where
are they then, hmm?

196
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,485
(scoffs)

197
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,755
We still don't know
for sure, guys,

198
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,223
if he was even here.

199
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:37,691
He was here.
Maze,

200
00:07:37,725 --> 00:07:39,827
I know you've got
your sources or whatever.

201
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,228
But I'm just saying,
until fingerprint

202
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:42,763
and DNA analysis
comes back,

203
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,532
we don't know...
I found his wallet.

204
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:46,700
Maze, where did you get that?

205
00:07:46,734 --> 00:07:48,235
It was in the corner over there

206
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:50,504
when we first
walked in.

207
00:07:50,538 --> 00:07:51,839
What? He's still my bounty,

208
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:52,906
and I haven't
found him.

209
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,608
CHLOE:
"Jay Lopez."

210
00:07:54,642 --> 00:07:56,710
It's your brother.

211
00:07:56,744 --> 00:07:58,579
(sighs) Which means
he's definitely...

212
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:00,748
Not the killer!

213
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:02,916
Based on the blood spatter,
the bullet was fired

214
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,151
from this angle, right?

215
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:05,653
It looks that way.

216
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:07,855
But this looks
like powder burn, okay?

217
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:10,924
So the only way to shoot
from this angle further back

218
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,260
would be if you were a lefty.

219
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:14,862
And-- drumroll,
please-- my brother

220
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,063
is a righty.

221
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:18,999
So, obviously, there must have
been another person here.

222
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:20,868
Uh, okay. Okay.

223
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:24,137
Well, we'll start looking
for this left-handed shooter.

224
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:25,873
But, in the meantime,

225
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:28,141
I really think it's
best for everybody

226
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,877
and-and your brother

227
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,946
if you just step away
from the investigation.

228
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,615
Okay, yeah. I-I get it.

229
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:36,016
But I'm gonna go
and try to find Jay.

230
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,951
I really would prefer you don't.

231
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:39,152
He could be in danger.

232
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,287
Okay, I'll call you

233
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,822
if we find anything.

234
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,291
Great. Now that we're done
with that charade,

235
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:46,760
shall we track down
Ms. Lopez's murderous brother

236
00:08:46,794 --> 00:08:47,895
before she does?

237
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:49,296
I trust Ella's instincts.

238
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:51,031
It does seem like there was
another person here.

239
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:52,165
So, just to be safe,

240
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,300
let's pursue
both scenarios.

241
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:56,069
Brothers can't be trusted,
Detective.

242
00:08:56,103 --> 00:08:59,940
You're just delaying
her inevitable disappointment.

243
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:01,975
Maybe.

244
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:05,813
Maybe not.

245
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:13,721
I've been through some...

246
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:15,255
(sighs)
trauma.

247
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,257
And I've been avoiding it.
(chuckles)

248
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,193
But, recently, um,
events have caused me to realize

249
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,829
that I need to...

250
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:23,931
face my fears.

251
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:27,100
Lucifer mentioned that
you worked wonders with him.

252
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:30,103
I mean, you see someone
who calls himself the Devil.

253
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:33,607
So anything I say can't sound
too crazy, right? (chuckles)

254
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:38,812
I haven't been
to therapy before.

255
00:09:38,846 --> 00:09:41,381
Is this where I start...

256
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,250
telling you
what I'm going through?

257
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:45,886
Um...

258
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,087
a couple of months ago,

259
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,891
I had a near-death experience.

260
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:55,829
And I think that-that
when I was dead, um,

261
00:09:55,863 --> 00:09:57,831
I think that I was in Hell,

262
00:09:57,865 --> 00:09:59,166
reliving the same nightmare...

263
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:00,701
I can't help you.

264
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:02,035
Excuse me?

265
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:04,872
You need to leave.

266
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:06,239
Now.

267
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,241
Oh, I'm...

268
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,043
Of course. I'm s...

269
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:12,245
(chuckles)
I'm so sorry to have...

270
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,981
to have wasted your time.

271
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:15,883
(door opens)

272
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:21,188
I really am beyond help,
aren't I?

273
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:30,130
(door opens)

274
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:31,398
(sighs)

275
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:32,866
Brothers.
(chuckles)

276
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,001
Am I right?

277
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:35,736
I mean, you get it.
You killed yours.

278
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:37,004
I wish I had that option.

279
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:38,739
Amenadiel won't
help, I take it?

280
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:40,140
Nope.

281
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:41,875
No. I mean,
I shouldn't be surprised.

282
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:43,410
Ever since he found out
he's Dad's favorite,

283
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:44,411
he's been a bit of a dick.

284
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:46,413
What do you mean?
Well, lots
of chest puffing

285
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:47,681
and peacocking.

286
00:10:47,715 --> 00:10:51,451
I mean, even more than usual,
with that insufferably smug...

287
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,287
No, I mean, how do you know
that he's God's favorite?

288
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:56,356
It's a long story,
involving a flaming sword

289
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,091
and a space vagina.

290
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,226
But the quick version:

291
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:01,294
a book said it,
so it must be true.

292
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,931
Anyway, not to worry.

293
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:06,399
I'll find a way
to bring him round.

294
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:13,306
Our victim's Fahrid Nasser--
he's an international
diamond salesman.

295
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,175
So it makes sense that
you'd find a loose diamond

296
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:18,045
in his office, but can you skip
to the part where you help us

297
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:20,047
track down Ms. Lopez's
disappointment of a brother?

298
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,448
I thought we were looking
for another suspect.

299
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:23,717
We are. Despite
Lucifer's attempt

300
00:11:23,751 --> 00:11:26,219
to make this case about what's
going on with his own brother.

301
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:28,055
You were saying, Dan?
Well,

302
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:30,791
it would make sense to find
a diamond in a broker's office,

303
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:32,192
unless that diamond
was reported stolen.

304
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:33,326
Fortunately for us,

305
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,328
diamonds are
pretty easy to track.

306
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,397
Each one of them has
a serial number

307
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,332
laser-etched into it.

308
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:42,502
I usually get them to add crude
drawings to the back of mine.

309
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,938
Where was it stolen from?
A diamond boutique

310
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:45,906
in Beverly Hills.

311
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:47,808
Here's the kicker--
Fahrid, our victim,

312
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:49,943
he's one of the store's
diamond brokers.
So, what,

313
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:51,812
he sells to them,
uses that as a cover

314
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:53,513
to the case the joint,
then robs it?
Maybe.

315
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,082
File on the robbery's
pretty thin--

316
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:57,084
no security cameras,
no witnesses,

317
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:59,086
not a lot to go on.
All right,

318
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:00,821
well, maybe Fahrid
had an accomplice?

319
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:02,222
That could be our
other suspect.

320
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,858
Let's go to the jewelry store,
see if we can drum up

321
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:07,427
any new leads now that we
know Fahrid is involved.

322
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,497
("Run Run Run"
by Kari Kimmel playing)

323
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,832
* I'm gonna find ya *

324
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:13,967
* Wherever-ever you are

325
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:15,235
* I'm gonna get ya *

326
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:18,038
* You're never gettin' too far *

327
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,173
* I'm gonna run, run, run... *

328
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:21,842
(sighs):
Ah, the diamond industry--

329
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,011
truly the greatest trick
someone other than me

330
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:25,445
played on the world.

331
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,380
Thousands of dollars
for lumps of old coal.

332
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:28,782
Incredible.

333
00:12:28,816 --> 00:12:31,251
Ah. Hello there.
We're here to...

334
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:33,453
We're here to...

335
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:34,454
to get a ring.

336
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,156
(giggles)
We are?

337
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:39,126
Yes. Yeah, he was
gonna surprise me.

338
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,894
But I knew what
he was up to.

339
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:43,130
(nervous chuckle)
We're engaged.
Oh.

340
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:44,031
How nice.

341
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:45,165
(both chuckle)

342
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:51,038
Mm.

343
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:54,007
Sweetie, I-I don't know
if we came to the right place.

344
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,276
I expect a, a much...

345
00:12:56,309 --> 00:13:00,147
higher clarity,
and-and the color here is blech.

346
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,915
Oh, I see you have
quite a discerning eye.

347
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:04,885
I have some
other wonderful options.

348
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:06,786
Just a moment.
Thank you.

349
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:10,423
I... am confused.

350
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,926
The file said that there was
no security footage.

351
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,495
All these cameras,
they're not new, which means

352
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:18,031
they were here at the time
of the robbery, which means

353
00:13:18,065 --> 00:13:19,466
this is probably
an inside job.

354
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:22,569
Yeah, I got that part--
flush out the accomplice,
et cetera, et cetera.

355
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:24,972
No, how do you know
so much about diamonds?

356
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:26,974
Well, I've watched
enough Real Housewives

357
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:28,842
to fake it with
the best of them.

358
00:13:28,876 --> 00:13:30,510
(laughs):
Oh. Wonderful.

359
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,312
Really?

360
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:35,048
(laughs):
No. No.

361
00:13:35,082 --> 00:13:36,316
These still
won't do.

362
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:40,320
How about this-- why don't
I show you what I don't want?

363
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:43,256
This is what he got me
for Valentine's Day.

364
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,225
I didn't know that
my future husband

365
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:46,459
was that cheap.

366
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,495
I am not cheap.

367
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:53,100
That diamond is
of the highest quality.

368
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:55,368
Is it? Is it of the
highest quality?

369
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:56,536
Mm-hmm.
Let's see.

370
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,405
(chuckles):
Oh.

371
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:04,344
Uh-huh, excellent color, and...

372
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:05,212
And what?

373
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:07,347
Uh, I'm sorry, uh...

374
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,282
I recognize
the serial number.

375
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:12,352
But, uh, this diamond is...

376
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:13,954
stolen.

377
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:15,355
No.
Stolen?

378
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:16,156
LUCIFER:
Can't be.

379
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,357
Stolen?!

380
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,959
You cheap son of a bitch.

381
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:21,094
I... For the last time,
I am not cheap.

382
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:23,096
I'm gonna have
to call the police.
Oh, yes,

383
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,497
please, please

384
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:25,966
call the cops.
(laughs)

385
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:29,369
I want my future
ex-husband arrested

386
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:31,972
for being cheap.
R-Right. For the final time,
d-darling...

387
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:34,641
No need to get
the authorities involved.

388
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:36,576
I'm Tiffany James,
the owner.

389
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,645
Why don't you come with me,

390
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:41,414
and we'll find you
the perfect diamond.

391
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:48,521
So, tell me exactly
what it is you're looking for.

392
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,457
It's funny,
Ms. James,

393
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,193
I was waiting for a clerk
to make a run for it,

394
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,528
or a security guard
to start sweating.

395
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:57,530
But the owner
of the store...

396
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:58,598
Excuse me?

397
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,333
Why rob your own store?

398
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:01,334
(laughs)

399
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:04,204
I don't know what
you're talking about.

400
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,673
I'm LAPD.
And I'm not cheap,
for the record.

401
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:09,276
But let's cut to the chase,
shall we, Tiffany?

402
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:11,478
How did you help Jay Lopez
steal diamonds

403
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:14,081
and murder Fahrid Nasser?

404
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:16,416
Who's Jay Lopez? Wait.

405
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:18,018
Fahrid's dead?

406
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:19,252
Stop prompting the witness.

407
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:22,022
Fine. But the sooner we prove
Ms. Lopez's elder brother

408
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:24,557
is a liar and a disappointment,
the better.

409
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:27,094
Would you excuse us
for a second?

410
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:29,362
Thank you.
(sighs)

411
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:31,031
It's obvious that
you're having

412
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:33,166
some kind of fight
with Amenadiel,

413
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,169
but right now you need
to focus on the case.

414
00:15:36,203 --> 00:15:39,572
Fine.
And for the record...

415
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:42,575
I wish I had a brother
to fight with.

416
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,177
But...

417
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:46,246
So, you admit to
knowing Fahrid.

418
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,448
Of course--
he sold diamonds here.

419
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:50,450
Wow, I can't believe
he's really dead.

420
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:53,320
Oh, a complete shock to you and
all your associates, I'm sure.

421
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:55,188
So let's get on with it,
shall we?

422
00:15:55,222 --> 00:15:57,057
Tell me...

423
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,391
Tiffany,

424
00:15:58,425 --> 00:16:02,262
what is it you desire?

425
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:06,199
To punch every millennial
in the face.

426
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:08,535
Really?
(chuckles)

427
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:09,536
I mean, I
don't disagree,

428
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:11,604
but still.

429
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:14,207
They've ruined
our entire industry.

430
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:17,210
With their social
consciousness and
ethical issues.

431
00:16:17,244 --> 00:16:19,012
Sales are way down
because of them.

432
00:16:19,046 --> 00:16:21,748
Do you know how hard it is
to stay afloat?
So hard

433
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:24,084
that you have to rob
your own store?
No one was supposed

434
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:25,752
to get hurt.

435
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:29,089
We just wanted
the insurance money.

436
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:31,558
(chuckles) This was
an insurance scam?

437
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:34,227
Then why kill Fahrid?
I didn't.

438
00:16:34,261 --> 00:16:36,229
Fahrid was supposed to sell
the diamonds back to us

439
00:16:36,263 --> 00:16:38,098
after he cleaned them, but...

440
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:40,233
now...

441
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:43,403
Well, I mean,
if anyone is cheap...

442
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:45,472
it's her.

443
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,145
Oh, why are we here?

444
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:54,514
Jay would never, ever stay
in a place like this.

445
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:56,516
Two days ago, he
used his debit card

446
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:58,518
at a gas station
around the corner.

447
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:00,787
So? Dude wanted a Slurpee--
it doesn't mean anything.

448
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,522
You don't come into
this neighborhood

449
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:04,257
unless you have a reason--
and if you're here

450
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:07,460
to do criminal activity, you
come to a hotel that takes cash.

451
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:09,262
He is not a criminal.
Yeah.

452
00:17:09,296 --> 00:17:11,198
You've... never seen

453
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:13,533
this guy, right?

454
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:15,402
Have you seen him?

455
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:17,470
Unless you got a warrant,

456
00:17:17,504 --> 00:17:20,140
I ain't answering
either of you.

457
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:20,707
Aah! Aah!

458
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:24,144
I'm gonna give you two choices.

459
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:25,278
I can either
break your arm...

460
00:17:25,312 --> 00:17:26,546
(grunts in pain)

461
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:29,282
...or I can cut your...

462
00:17:29,316 --> 00:17:30,683
Maze! Just...

463
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:33,153
Do you have

464
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:34,621
a brother, sister,

465
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:38,291
anyone who you care about,
who it would just kill you

466
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:40,760
if you didn't know
where they were,
if they were safe?

467
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,829
Threatening his family?

468
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:43,730
Hard-core, Ellen.

469
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:47,434
Ten bucks an hour
ain't worth this.

470
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:48,635
(gasping breath)

471
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:50,570
(groans)

472
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:52,539
(relieved
exhale)

473
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:55,608
No Jay here. See?

474
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,711
Oh, no.

475
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,380
Michael Knight.

476
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:01,581
Who's that?

477
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:03,216
Knight Rider.

478
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:06,353
Jay's favorite show.

479
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:19,666
(knocking)

480
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:21,368
Doctor.

481
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:23,403
I got your text.
What's wrong?

482
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:24,537
Charlotte Richards.

483
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:25,738
What about her?

484
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:28,475
She came to see me--
as a client.

485
00:18:28,508 --> 00:18:30,143
Oh, good, good.

486
00:18:30,177 --> 00:18:31,678
She took my advice.

487
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:33,746
Why would you
send her to me?

488
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,148
Because you're the best.

489
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:36,549
She tried to kill me.

490
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,218
When she stepped
into my office,

491
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:40,487
everything she did
came rushing back.

492
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,888
Doctor...

493
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:44,491
my mother is gone.

494
00:18:44,524 --> 00:18:47,126
Charlotte Richards
has done nothing to you.

495
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:53,500
She's just an innocent woman
who needs help.

496
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:55,568
(exhales)

497
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:57,704
Here.

498
00:18:57,737 --> 00:19:01,208
(sighs) At least she
didn't try and kiss you.

499
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,511
Hey, Chloe.

500
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:06,546
This is Don Zeikel,
the insurance adjustor

501
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:08,548
that covers
Tiffany James's store.

502
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:09,849
I'm in your debt.

503
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:11,451
It's rare we actually catch
insurance fraud.

504
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,586
Makes me miss being a cop.

505
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,256
Bet you don't miss the sad
amounts on the pay stubs.
(chuckles)

506
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:17,724
No. Better Scotch
and stylish clothes
don't make up

507
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:19,792
for that rush you get
when you catch a bad guy.

508
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:22,595
Now that I've gone corporate,
I just pay out the claims.

509
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:24,664
Why's that?
Oh, it's practically
an untraceable crime

510
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:26,266
if the thieves
got a cleaner.

511
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:28,268
A cleaner?
It's someone
who can replace

512
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:31,204
the microscopic
serial numbers
on the diamonds.

513
00:19:31,238 --> 00:19:32,672
Like a diamond
authenticator.
Sure.

514
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:34,541
Why? You know of
an authenticator involved?

515
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:36,809
(sighs)
Not yet.
Well,

516
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,545
please keep me
in the loop.

517
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:39,579
Great. Thank you.

518
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:44,284
Why do I get the feeling that
our two-pronged investigation

519
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:45,818
just lost a prong?

520
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:48,288
We got to find
Ella's brother.

521
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:50,857
*

522
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:57,230
You got any siblings?

523
00:19:57,264 --> 00:19:58,831
Thousands and thousands.

524
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:01,734
(chuckles): Yeah. It could
feel like that sometimes.

525
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:03,570
You close to
any of 'em?

526
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:05,572
My family
doesn't do "close."

527
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:07,307
We mostly tortured
each other.

528
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,375
Aw, man, us, too.

529
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:09,842
My brothers used
to put their knees

530
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,512
on my arms and dangle a
loogie right over my face.

531
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,314
Sounds horrifying.
But then,

532
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:16,316
if I was ever in trouble,

533
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:18,351
they always had my back.

534
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:19,952
No matter what.

535
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:24,257
This is it.

536
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:26,793
Whoa!

537
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:30,363
No need to go all kung fu
on this innocent door.

538
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,903
Well, aren't you full
of surprises.

539
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:40,907
Nice job, Ellen.

540
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,542
It's Ella.

541
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:43,643
(door creaks)

542
00:20:44,511 --> 00:20:46,413
(grunting)

543
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:47,414
(yells)

544
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,017
(choking)

545
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,919
Jay?

546
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:58,391
* I'm all out of love *

547
00:20:58,425 --> 00:20:59,926
* I'm all out of love
for you... *

548
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:04,397
So I finally get to meet
the infamous Amenadiel.

549
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:07,634
Look, I know who you are,
and I know what you want.

550
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:09,502
But I can't help you.

551
00:21:09,536 --> 00:21:11,037
Sorry.
Oh, come on,

552
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:14,040
buddy, I just
want to chat.
Yeah? About what?

553
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:15,542
The weather.

554
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:16,909
Sports.

555
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:19,078
By chance, you have any
idea how annoying it is

556
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,913
to be an immortal
human being?

557
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:22,081
I can't say that I do.

558
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,683
Oh, well, let me
enlighten you.

559
00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:26,519
You see, first you get to
watch everyone you love die,

560
00:21:26,553 --> 00:21:27,787
over and over.

561
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,389
And that sucks.

562
00:21:29,422 --> 00:21:31,958
And on top of that, it's boring.

563
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:34,461
I've been everywhere
there is to go.

564
00:21:34,494 --> 00:21:36,463
Tried every kind of food.

565
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:37,797
Sex. Music.

566
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:40,099
Nothing surprises me anymore.

567
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,402
Have you tried Game of Thrones?

568
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:46,072
It's been a literal
Hell on Earth.

569
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:48,074
Well, the punishment
fits the crime, Pierce.

570
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:50,410
A little harsh
if you ask me.

571
00:21:50,443 --> 00:21:52,679
My Father always
has His reasons.

572
00:21:52,712 --> 00:21:54,080
Right.

573
00:21:54,113 --> 00:21:55,815
I've always wondered

574
00:21:55,848 --> 00:21:58,718
who your Father would assign
such an important task.

575
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:00,953
It must have been someone
He really trusted.

576
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:04,056
Maybe... His favorite son.

577
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,727
You marked me, didn't you?

578
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:14,701
Yeah. It was me.

579
00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:16,703
And you deserved it.
I didn't come here

580
00:22:16,736 --> 00:22:18,571
to argue right or wrong.
In fact,

581
00:22:18,605 --> 00:22:19,972
I just need your help.

582
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:22,975
And, see, the good
news for me is,

583
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:25,011
this can actually hurt you now.

584
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:28,848
You put this mark on me.

585
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:30,683
Now you're gonna tell me
how to get rid of it.

586
00:22:34,487 --> 00:22:36,122
I didn't kill anyone!

587
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:37,490
MAZE:
And what better way

588
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:39,158
to prove it than
by swinging a bat at us?

589
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,760
I thought you were
trying to kill me.

590
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:42,595
No, we're trying
to help you, Jay.

591
00:22:42,629 --> 00:22:44,997
Your wallet was found
at the scene of a murder.

592
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:46,132
What the
hell's going on?

593
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:48,134
Fahrid, the dead guy?

594
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:50,603
Yeah?
He was a gem broker
I worked with in L.A.

595
00:22:50,637 --> 00:22:51,804
a few times in the past.

596
00:22:51,838 --> 00:22:53,473
He hired me to authenticate
some diamonds.

597
00:22:53,506 --> 00:22:55,041
Stolen diamonds.

598
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:57,009
If they were stolen,
I had no idea.

599
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:58,911
But now that I
think about it,

600
00:22:58,945 --> 00:23:01,047
Fahrid was acting
kind of strange.

601
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,884
Strange how?
Jumpy. He must have made me
jumpy, too, cause I had to pee.

602
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:07,019
I was in the bathroom
when it happened.

603
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:09,021
You know how I get
when I'm nervous.

604
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:10,923
When I was in there,
I heard arguing

605
00:23:10,957 --> 00:23:12,625
and then gunshots.

606
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:15,795
After I came out, I saw
Fahrid. He was... dead.

607
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:17,497
I was freaked out,
so I bailed.

608
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,065
Hmm.

609
00:23:20,967 --> 00:23:22,669
(Ella speaks Spanish)
Ella!

610
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:26,205
I work for the cops, Jay!
I could've helped you.

611
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,207
Why? Why did you...?
I didn't want to
worry you. Stop!

612
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,776
Please be civilized.

613
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:32,645
I know it looks bad, but
you got to believe me. I...

614
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:33,946
I didn't kill anyone.

615
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,816
(phone ringing)

616
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:38,050
(phone beeps on)

617
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:39,719
Hey, Chloe.
What's up?

618
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:41,087
So we've had no luck

619
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,589
finding this supposed
other person.

620
00:23:42,622 --> 00:23:43,790
We may need to

621
00:23:43,823 --> 00:23:45,658
consider other scenarios.

622
00:23:45,692 --> 00:23:48,094
Like that maybe Jay...

623
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:50,797
wasn't just a witness
to the murder.

624
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:53,833
Look, I know that this is tough,
but I think it's best

625
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:55,067
if we talk
to Jay first.

626
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:56,869
So, have you had any
luck finding him?

627
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:04,110
No. No luck.

628
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:05,244
Okay.

629
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,546
Okay. Well,

630
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:08,981
let us know if you do.

631
00:24:09,015 --> 00:24:10,617
BOTH:
She's lying.

632
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,619
Who's lying?
Your stylist?

633
00:24:12,652 --> 00:24:14,954
Ella. More and more,
it looks like

634
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:16,856
her brother Jay
might be our shooter.

635
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:18,257
And because she's
too close to it,

636
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,726
she can't see
the facts clearly.

637
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:21,093
We need
to get inside Ella's head,

638
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:22,962
figure out where
she's taking Jay.

639
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:24,831
If you were her,
where would you guys go?

640
00:24:24,864 --> 00:24:26,966
Ooh. Uh... strip club.

641
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:29,101
Comic-Con.
Bar.

642
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:30,603
A forensics
convention.

643
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:32,572
Strip club.
Dude, you already
said that.

644
00:24:32,605 --> 00:24:34,006
Why would Ella take her
brother to a strip club?

645
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,576
For the free buffet.
Above all else,
Ella's dedicated

646
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:39,011
to her job. If she truly thinks
Jay is innocent,

647
00:24:39,045 --> 00:24:41,147
she's gonna want
to prove it, which means...

648
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,815
She'll go back to
the crime scene.

649
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:46,586
So what's it gonna be,
Amenadiel?

650
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:48,988
You gonna help me die,
or vice versa?

651
00:24:49,021 --> 00:24:51,257
Pierce, do as you must,
because I can't help you.

652
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,292
You're proud. I get it.

653
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,127
You don't want to upset Daddy.

654
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:57,630
You might not care
if you get killed.

655
00:24:57,664 --> 00:25:01,033
Are you willing to let an
innocent die for pride?

656
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,738
You wouldn't.

657
00:25:05,772 --> 00:25:07,540
I killed my own brother.

658
00:25:07,574 --> 00:25:08,808
What makes you think

659
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:11,310
I wouldn't kill some random
person to finally have peace?

660
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,780
Maybe the guy wearing
the scarf indoors.

661
00:25:13,813 --> 00:25:15,314
No one'll miss him.

662
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,149
Enough!

663
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:20,753
Yes. I gave you the mark.

664
00:25:20,787 --> 00:25:22,922
But I was only
the messenger, Pierce.

665
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:25,291
I have no idea how to remove it.

666
00:25:25,324 --> 00:25:28,060
Actually, I believe you.

667
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:35,034
Everybody out! Now!

668
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:37,637
(people screaming)
What are you doing?!
I told you everything I know.

669
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,171
I thought you wouldn't
have been of any use,

670
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:41,107
but I needed
to make sure.
(scoffs)

671
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,275
So now what?

672
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:46,178
Well, now I finally get
to kick your angelic ass.

673
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:48,214
(grunts)

674
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:53,686
You know, that didn't feel
as good as I'd hoped.

675
00:25:54,821 --> 00:25:55,788
But you know what they say.

676
00:25:55,822 --> 00:25:56,923
At first you don't succeed...

677
00:25:56,956 --> 00:25:59,191
This won't end well for you.

678
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:01,093
(both grunting)

679
00:26:01,127 --> 00:26:04,063
* Here we go, here we go,
here we go again *

680
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:07,700
* Tell your ma, tell your pa,
tell your girlfriend *

681
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:10,670
* Here we come, here we come,
here we come again *

682
00:26:10,703 --> 00:26:14,206
* Take you on a ride
that never ends... *

683
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,075
Your Shotokan's not bad.

684
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:17,209
How's your hapkido?

685
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:18,978
Better than yours.
Yeah?

686
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:20,813
(grunting)
* Better than who came
before us *

687
00:26:20,847 --> 00:26:22,348
* Don't bore us,
get to the chorus... *

688
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:24,851
This is getting fun.

689
00:26:24,884 --> 00:26:26,118
(both grunting)

690
00:26:26,152 --> 00:26:28,120
* Don't bore us,
get to the chorus *

691
00:26:28,154 --> 00:26:30,957
* Can't stop, can't stop,
can't stop the unstoppable *

692
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:34,393
* Nothing's gonna stand
in our way *

693
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:37,830
* Can't stop, can't stop,
can't stop the unstoppable *

694
00:26:37,864 --> 00:26:39,732
* Nothing's gonna stand
in our way... *

695
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:41,367
Are you still having fun?

696
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,971
* Ooh, ooh-ooh,
ooh, ooh-ooh *

697
00:26:45,004 --> 00:26:48,140
* Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh

698
00:26:48,174 --> 00:26:49,876
(grunting)
* Yeah, we're back *

699
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:52,011
* Yeah, we're back,
yeah, we're back for good *

700
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:55,381
* From New York all the way
out to Hollywood... *

701
00:26:55,414 --> 00:26:56,749
Don't make me do this.

702
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:58,851
Do what?
You gonna kill me?

703
00:26:58,885 --> 00:27:00,386
* Spin you round...

704
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:04,824
(grunting)

705
00:27:14,901 --> 00:27:16,869
(gasps loudly)

706
00:27:16,903 --> 00:27:19,171
(groans)

707
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:26,445
Don't think a little death...
is gonna stop me.

708
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:29,916
* Hey... hey

709
00:27:29,949 --> 00:27:32,218
* Hey... hey.

710
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:39,759
Okay, walk me through
exactly what happened.

711
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:41,761
Like I said, I was
in the bathroom

712
00:27:41,794 --> 00:27:43,462
when I heard
the gunshots.

713
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,331
Then I stayed quiet.

714
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:48,300
After I saw the gunman
leave, I came out.
Whoa, whoa, wait.

715
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:49,802
You saw the shooter?

716
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:51,337
Yeah, I peeked
out from the door

717
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,072
and saw him standing
over Fahrid.

718
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:55,174
Jay, if you saw him,
you can identify him.

719
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:57,476
He wore all black
and a ski mask.

720
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,078
I-I didn't get a
good look at him.

721
00:27:59,111 --> 00:28:00,847
Come on. Think, Jay. Think.

722
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,348
There has to be something
that you remember.

723
00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:05,952
Wingtips. The guy wore
red wingtip shoes.

724
00:28:05,985 --> 00:28:07,086
Does that help?

725
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:09,956
Everything helps.

726
00:28:09,989 --> 00:28:12,691
Okay, so you said you saw him
from the bathroom, right?

727
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:23,102
Jay, the... door opens outward.

728
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:24,503
So?

729
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:28,474
So... Jay,
from your vantage point inside,

730
00:28:28,507 --> 00:28:30,276
it would have been impossible

731
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:32,845
for you to see the killer
standing over the body.

732
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:34,080
Look, I saw what I saw.

733
00:28:34,113 --> 00:28:35,815
Where's the stash room?

734
00:28:35,848 --> 00:28:37,116
If Fahrid is
a diamond thief,

735
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:38,350
he'd definitely have
a stash room.

736
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:40,219
And if I were him,

737
00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:42,254
I would hide it right...

738
00:28:42,288 --> 00:28:44,156
here.

739
00:28:56,903 --> 00:28:59,972
Looks like
laser-engraving equipment.

740
00:29:00,006 --> 00:29:01,874
CHLOE:
Ella?

741
00:29:01,908 --> 00:29:03,409
What the hell, Ella!
Did you call the cops?

742
00:29:03,442 --> 00:29:04,777
I trusted you!

743
00:29:04,811 --> 00:29:06,378
No. I swear,
I didn't call them!

744
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:09,515
This is much more fun
than a strip club.
Is that a stash room?

745
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:12,384
Yeah. Full of laser-engraving
equipment.
LUCIFER:
Ah!

746
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:13,352
Seems that Don Zeikel fellow

747
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:15,521
you were telling me about
was onto something.

748
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:17,857
Who was onto what?

749
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,525
He's the insurance adjuster
for the missing diamonds.

750
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:21,794
He said that equipment replaces
the serial number

751
00:29:21,828 --> 00:29:23,029
on the stolen diamonds.

752
00:29:24,163 --> 00:29:26,298
Is that what you were doing?

753
00:29:26,332 --> 00:29:29,301
Okay, fine.

754
00:29:29,335 --> 00:29:30,870
Yeah, I was in here

755
00:29:30,903 --> 00:29:32,304
cleaning the diamonds.

756
00:29:32,338 --> 00:29:33,772
But it was a one-time thing.

757
00:29:37,476 --> 00:29:40,012
Jay, stay calm.

758
00:29:40,046 --> 00:29:42,314
Relax, Jay. We'll
go to the precinct,

759
00:29:42,348 --> 00:29:44,016
talk about this,
figure it out.

760
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:47,453
But first you need
to put the gun down.

761
00:29:47,486 --> 00:29:50,156
Why? No matter what
I say or do,

762
00:29:50,189 --> 00:29:51,190
you're not gonna
believe me.

763
00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:52,458
So what's the point?

764
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,462
Wait! You don't have to do this.

765
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:58,364
Oh, Ms. Lopez.

766
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,533
You still think he's innocent?

767
00:30:10,376 --> 00:30:12,344
(indistinct chatter,
camera shutter clicking)

768
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,083
Well, Ellen...

769
00:30:18,617 --> 00:30:19,818
...it's been fun.

770
00:30:21,353 --> 00:30:23,122
You can't leave.

771
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,590
Why? Job's done.

772
00:30:24,623 --> 00:30:26,859
But Jay needs our help! I mean,

773
00:30:26,893 --> 00:30:28,194
so he got mixed up
with some bad dudes.

774
00:30:28,227 --> 00:30:29,461
Okay, he's not a murderer.

775
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:32,531
He's like Harrison Ford,
but less growly.

776
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:35,935
The whole police force thinks
that he's guilty now.

777
00:30:35,968 --> 00:30:38,070
We need to get to him first.

778
00:30:38,104 --> 00:30:40,139
You hired me to find
him. I found him.

779
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,541
The fee doesn't include
post-seizure baby-sitting.

780
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:43,876
Please.

781
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:46,012
(scoffs) Fine.

782
00:30:46,045 --> 00:30:48,014
I could stay...

783
00:30:48,047 --> 00:30:50,216
for a price.

784
00:30:50,249 --> 00:30:52,484
But...

785
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:54,486
I thought... you and I...

786
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,155
you know, we-we connected.

787
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:58,424
You really don't care at all

788
00:30:58,457 --> 00:31:00,026
about helping me
find my brother?

789
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:02,028
You mean the brother
who forged diamonds,

790
00:31:02,061 --> 00:31:04,296
pulled a gun on us,
probably killed a guy,

791
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:07,967
and who's definitely been
lying to you all this time?

792
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,468
No, not particularly.

793
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:13,239
Maybe you're right.

794
00:31:13,272 --> 00:31:16,008
Maybe Jay's not who
I thought he was.

795
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:18,110
Maybe it was... all a lie?

796
00:31:18,144 --> 00:31:19,678
No, but you know what?

797
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,181
Family shouldn't do that
to each other.

798
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:24,350
I mean, we're supposed
to help each other.

799
00:31:26,152 --> 00:31:28,120
Okay.

800
00:31:28,154 --> 00:31:29,555
Good talk.

801
00:31:32,158 --> 00:31:33,559
(sighs)

802
00:31:33,592 --> 00:31:35,327
No sign of him.

803
00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:37,129
That was certainly exciting,
wasn't it?

804
00:31:37,163 --> 00:31:39,265
Go ahead. Say it.
I...

805
00:31:39,298 --> 00:31:40,699
"I told you so,
your brother's a killer."

806
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:44,003
Come on, say it-- that you
were right all along.

807
00:31:44,036 --> 00:31:45,437
Ms. Lopez, uh...

808
00:31:45,471 --> 00:31:47,006
(whimpers)

809
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:50,542
How could I have
been so blind?

810
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:53,612
I mean, Jay lied to
me about everything.

811
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:56,348
He obviously lied about
seeing the killer. too.

812
00:31:56,382 --> 00:31:58,584
Not necessarily. Ella?

813
00:32:00,386 --> 00:32:02,621
Wait. Maybe Jay did
see the killer,

814
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:05,291
not from the bathroom,
but from right here.

815
00:32:05,324 --> 00:32:07,493
What exactly
did he say he saw?

816
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:09,195
ELLA:
Uh, a guy wearing a mask

817
00:32:09,228 --> 00:32:11,630
and... red wingtip shoes.

818
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:13,332
LUCIFER:
Wingtips? Oh.

819
00:32:13,365 --> 00:32:16,035
That's oddly strong
footwear game for a murderer.

820
00:32:16,068 --> 00:32:18,170
Yeah. Stylish.

821
00:32:18,204 --> 00:32:21,107
I think I know
who killed Fahrid.

822
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,375
JAY: Fahrid told me
you'd be at this hotel

823
00:32:23,409 --> 00:32:25,344
right before
you killed him.

824
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:29,348
I'm not letting you get away
with this.

825
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:32,451
You're Fahrid's
diamond nerd.

826
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:34,953
I should've figured
you'd be in town.

827
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,260
I'm getting blamed
for what you did.

828
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:43,262
You're gonna confess
to the murder.

829
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:44,463
Whatever you want.

830
00:32:44,496 --> 00:32:46,398
Let-let's go to the police.

831
00:32:46,432 --> 00:32:47,633
I-I'll tell the truth.

832
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:48,767
No!

833
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,536
Do it right now.

834
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:52,404
Call the cops.

835
00:32:52,438 --> 00:32:54,606
Sure thing.

836
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,543
Uh, can I use your phone?

837
00:32:57,576 --> 00:32:59,578
Mine's dead.

838
00:33:04,683 --> 00:33:06,785
Never held a gun
before, have you?

839
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,620
You're gonna kill me now, too?

840
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:11,657
No. Need you to clean
those diamonds, first.

841
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,393
Then I'll kill you.

842
00:33:19,398 --> 00:33:21,267
Ella, you're
too close to it.

843
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,434
No, Chloe, I can help.
It's my brother.
Hey, hey.

844
00:33:22,468 --> 00:33:24,570
Just trust me, okay?

845
00:33:24,603 --> 00:33:26,672
I promise you,
we got this.

846
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:33,579
* I've got all the time *

847
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:35,581
* In the world...

848
00:33:35,614 --> 00:33:37,549
*

849
00:33:45,091 --> 00:33:47,293
(both grunting)

850
00:33:48,827 --> 00:33:50,296
(groans)

851
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:57,303
(groans)
That's gonna leave a mark,

852
00:33:57,336 --> 00:33:59,171
at least for a little while.

853
00:34:00,606 --> 00:34:02,174
(grunts)

854
00:34:05,644 --> 00:34:07,679
We don't have to do this.

855
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:09,281
You didn't have to curse me,
either,

856
00:34:09,315 --> 00:34:10,449
but you did that, didn't you?

857
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:12,718
(screams)

858
00:34:17,123 --> 00:34:18,190
(grunts)

859
00:34:18,224 --> 00:34:20,326
Accept the punishment
that you deserve.

860
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:21,560
You know nothing

861
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:23,362
about what I deserve.

862
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:25,497
Oh, I know that my Father is
punishing you

863
00:34:25,531 --> 00:34:27,199
because you killed
your own brother.

864
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:29,101
Yeah, notice anyone else in here

865
00:34:29,135 --> 00:34:30,836
who plotted to kill
his own brother?

866
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:33,205
No, that was different.

867
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:36,808
Well, it was only different
'cause you failed.

868
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,779
We are nothing alike.

869
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:43,749
Yeah, you're right.

870
00:34:45,384 --> 00:34:47,319
At least I had the balls
to do it myself.

871
00:34:47,353 --> 00:34:48,520
(panting)

872
00:34:48,554 --> 00:34:51,523
You pawned the task off on
someone else, you're worse.

873
00:34:51,557 --> 00:34:54,593
And if this is the punishment
that I get for my crimes,

874
00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:56,228
what do you deserve?

875
00:34:58,564 --> 00:35:00,499
There it is,
that look on your face.

876
00:35:02,568 --> 00:35:05,204
That's what I wanted.

877
00:35:05,237 --> 00:35:07,206
That feels good.

878
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:08,840
(groans)

879
00:35:11,177 --> 00:35:12,744
(panting)

880
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:14,446
Little help?

881
00:35:32,598 --> 00:35:33,865
Jay.

882
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:41,240
JAY: Get the hell
out of here,

883
00:35:41,273 --> 00:35:42,641
crazy woman who I don't know.

884
00:35:42,674 --> 00:35:44,910
And leave you with this psycho
killer, Jay? Are you nuts?

885
00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:46,645
See? Left-handed.

886
00:35:46,678 --> 00:35:48,714
I knew you were innocent.
Are you two done?

887
00:35:48,747 --> 00:35:51,250
LAPD knows that you killed
Fahrid Nasser,

888
00:35:51,283 --> 00:35:52,784
thanks to your
"on fleek" shoe game.

889
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:54,853
Look, Fahrid and I
had a good thing going.

890
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:56,588
For years, he'd
steal the diamonds,

891
00:35:56,622 --> 00:35:58,390
I'd write the claim,
we split the money.

892
00:35:58,424 --> 00:35:59,658
But the bastard
got greedy.

893
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:01,593
Cut me out.
Nobody cuts me out.

894
00:36:01,627 --> 00:36:03,529
Look, man, I'll do
whatever you want.

895
00:36:03,562 --> 00:36:04,863
Just leave her out of this.

896
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:06,865
Sorry. She's
seen my face.

897
00:36:17,243 --> 00:36:18,176
You okay?

898
00:36:23,982 --> 00:36:27,886
That's so Maze.

899
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:29,855
(indistinct police radio
chatter)

900
00:36:33,592 --> 00:36:34,560
Hi.

901
00:36:34,593 --> 00:36:36,562
Hey.

902
00:36:36,595 --> 00:36:38,997
So, the knife...

903
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,967
just came out
of nowhere, huh?

904
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,970
Yep, just random blade
out of thin air.

905
00:36:45,003 --> 00:36:47,506
I mean, anyone
could've thrown it.

906
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:48,840
Crazy.

907
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:49,841
Ella, I know it was Maze.

908
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:52,311
Oh.
Yeah.

909
00:36:52,344 --> 00:36:53,445
She's my roommate.

910
00:36:53,479 --> 00:36:54,613
I recognize the knife.

911
00:36:54,646 --> 00:36:56,848
But don't worry,
she's not in trouble.

912
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:58,717
She was just trying
to protect you, right?

913
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,752
She saved my life.

914
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:10,462
So I doubt the DA
will press charges.

915
00:37:10,496 --> 00:37:12,731
All he did was intend to
change the serial numbers

916
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:13,999
on the stolen diamonds;
it's not a crime.

917
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:15,401
Lucky Jay.

918
00:37:17,035 --> 00:37:18,737
I'm sure if any other cop
had been working this case,

919
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:21,473
he would have ended up
in prison or worse.

920
00:37:21,507 --> 00:37:23,875
So, well done, Detective.

921
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:25,411
Oh, my God.

922
00:37:25,444 --> 00:37:28,347
Did the world just
turn upside down?

923
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,948
Did you just admit
to being wrong?

924
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:31,817
(laughs)
I wouldn't quite
go that far...

925
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,485
(laughs)

926
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:36,688
...but I'm sure if you
had a brother, he...

927
00:37:36,722 --> 00:37:38,824
he would be very proud of you.

928
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:40,759
Thank you.

929
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:43,562
Anyway, this whole torrid affair

930
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:45,831
started with a bag
of stolen diamonds,

931
00:37:45,864 --> 00:37:48,033
so where are the diamonds?

932
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:49,768
Well, we're still
checking Zeikel's stuff.

933
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:51,036
You know, houses, cars.

934
00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:52,504
I'm sure they'll turn up.

935
00:37:52,538 --> 00:37:54,673
(chuckles) Indeed.

936
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:09,054
Uh, did I forget something
at your office?

937
00:38:09,087 --> 00:38:10,922
No. I, uh, I actually,

938
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:12,924
I actually came to apologize.

939
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:15,394
For what?

940
00:38:15,427 --> 00:38:17,863
For refusing to treat you.

941
00:38:17,896 --> 00:38:20,732
My extreme reaction

942
00:38:20,766 --> 00:38:23,735
had nothing to do with
how scary... (chuckles)

943
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:25,604
...your story sounded.

944
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:28,540
Believe me, I've heard
much, much worse.

945
00:38:28,574 --> 00:38:30,075
I was holding you accountable

946
00:38:30,108 --> 00:38:31,943
for things you simply didn't do.

947
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:35,013
I hurt you, didn't I,
during my lost time?

948
00:38:38,717 --> 00:38:40,085
It doesn't matter.

949
00:38:40,118 --> 00:38:41,953
It wasn't you.

950
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:44,556
So if you want to come back
for a session,

951
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:46,958
I'd... I'd like to try and help.

952
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:50,095
I don't need handouts.

953
00:38:50,128 --> 00:38:52,898
I mean, you don't have
to treat me.

954
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:54,032
I think I do...

955
00:38:55,734 --> 00:38:57,035
for both of us.

956
00:38:58,804 --> 00:39:00,338
I just have to
check one thing.

957
00:39:02,941 --> 00:39:03,909
Ow!

958
00:39:04,876 --> 00:39:06,612
(exhales)

959
00:39:08,614 --> 00:39:09,781
Excellent.

960
00:39:16,622 --> 00:39:18,524
(slow hand clap)

961
00:39:21,627 --> 00:39:23,395
LUCIFER:
Ah, the slow hand clap,

962
00:39:23,429 --> 00:39:25,597
it never gets old, does it?

963
00:39:25,631 --> 00:39:27,766
(laughs)
Hey, man.

964
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:29,134
It's not what it looks like.

965
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:30,936
Save it.

966
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:33,071
Evil Lopez.

967
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:35,140
Clearly this wasn't
a "one-time deal."

968
00:39:35,173 --> 00:39:36,942
It seems you're not
quite as virtuous

969
00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:38,877
as your sister would
like to believe.

970
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,912
Whatever, man. You don't know
what it's like

971
00:39:40,946 --> 00:39:42,748
making sure
everyone's looked after.

972
00:39:42,781 --> 00:39:44,015
It all falls on me.

973
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:46,485
Ah, so you felt entitled

974
00:39:46,518 --> 00:39:49,020
to stick your hand in
the proverbial cookie jar

975
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:50,756
because it
"took care of your family"?

976
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:52,924
It started small.

977
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:54,893
I had to bail a brother out.

978
00:39:54,926 --> 00:39:56,628
Then Abuela needed surgery.

979
00:39:56,662 --> 00:39:58,630
Guess who they
all came to.

980
00:39:58,664 --> 00:40:00,031
I didn't choose this.

981
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:03,635
But the Armani suit must help
ease the pain.

982
00:40:03,669 --> 00:40:07,038
(scoffs) I take care
of my family,

983
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:09,775
so if I get a little
bit, too, so what?

984
00:40:09,808 --> 00:40:11,176
I'm not perfect.

985
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:14,179
But you like them to think
that you are.

986
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:16,715
When, really, you're no better
than them.

987
00:40:20,118 --> 00:40:21,987
You're gonna tell Ella,
aren't you?

988
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,523
All right, just...

989
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:26,658
let me do it.

990
00:40:26,692 --> 00:40:28,927
She should hear it from me.

991
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,996
You're not gonna tell her
anything.

992
00:40:32,964 --> 00:40:35,667
And neither am I.

993
00:40:35,701 --> 00:40:38,069
You're not?

994
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:39,938
No.

995
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:42,107
Ms. Lopez puts a lot
of faith in you,

996
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,142
and losing that faith
would hurt her.

997
00:40:45,577 --> 00:40:47,579
And I won't allow
that to happen.

998
00:40:49,581 --> 00:40:52,751
I'll get my act
together, I promise.

999
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,953
No need to promise, Jay Lopez.

1000
00:40:54,986 --> 00:40:56,955
Because I'll be watching you,

1001
00:40:56,988 --> 00:41:00,892
and if you ever
disappoint her again...

1002
00:41:02,628 --> 00:41:04,029
I'll come for you.

1003
00:41:15,073 --> 00:41:17,042
* The mind says no sir

1004
00:41:17,075 --> 00:41:18,977
* But the body says please

1005
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,846
Bloody hell.

1006
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:22,113
* The heart stays silent...

1007
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:24,115
What does the other
guy look like?

1008
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:26,184
Immortal.

1009
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:28,720
* And I don't know why
I'm telling you this *

1010
00:41:28,754 --> 00:41:31,657
I'm the one that gave
Pierce his mark, Luci.

1011
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:33,124
* There's a road
once traveled... *

1012
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:34,125
(scoffs)

1013
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:35,861
Right.

1014
00:41:35,894 --> 00:41:38,764
So that's why you wouldn't help.

1015
00:41:38,797 --> 00:41:40,999
Didn't want to remove
your handiwork.

1016
00:41:41,032 --> 00:41:43,602
All of this has nothing to do
with me.

1017
00:41:43,635 --> 00:41:46,872
I... I couldn't just remove it,
even if I wanted to,

1018
00:41:46,905 --> 00:41:50,141
because it's supposed
to be there.

1019
00:41:50,175 --> 00:41:52,043
Father cursed him for a reason.

1020
00:41:52,077 --> 00:41:53,278
(scoffs)

1021
00:41:53,311 --> 00:41:55,614
I know you think

1022
00:41:55,647 --> 00:41:56,414
you're friends with Pierce.

1023
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:58,884
I get it, but I am
warning you, Luci.

1024
00:41:58,917 --> 00:42:01,286
He has but one selfish goal.

1025
00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:03,154
And working with him

1026
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:06,224
will only incur Father's wrath.

1027
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:08,894
(laughing):
What the...?

1028
00:42:08,927 --> 00:42:10,962
That's the bloody point.

1029
00:42:10,996 --> 00:42:12,898
(laughs)

1030
00:42:12,931 --> 00:42:15,901
(sighs)
Look, I know...

1031
00:42:15,934 --> 00:42:18,637
you're just being
a good older brother.

1032
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:20,772
Trying to protect me, 'cause
you think I need protecting.

1033
00:42:20,806 --> 00:42:23,308
Yes, that's right, because
I am my brother's keeper.

1034
00:42:23,341 --> 00:42:24,710
I am grateful,

1035
00:42:24,743 --> 00:42:28,246
Brother, truly, I am.

1036
00:42:30,348 --> 00:42:34,052
But I don't need protecting.

1037
00:42:34,085 --> 00:42:37,055
All that I am saying

1038
00:42:37,088 --> 00:42:40,926
is that this alliance with
Pierce will not end well.

1039
00:42:40,959 --> 00:42:42,093
Well, one can only hope.

1040
00:42:42,127 --> 00:42:43,795
And all I'm saying

1041
00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:45,797
is that if you
continue to meddle,

1042
00:42:45,831 --> 00:42:47,599
Amenadiel...

1043
00:42:48,967 --> 00:42:51,803
...then you will be in my way.

1044
00:42:51,837 --> 00:42:55,874
Well, then, Brother.

1045
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:57,208
Yes.

1046
00:42:57,242 --> 00:43:00,812
I guess I'll be in your way.

1047
00:43:00,846 --> 00:43:02,748
*

1048
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:10,656
(scoffs)
