It was him. Forest killed her.

226

Why do you believe that?13 years ago,

227
00:09:19,733 --> 00:09:21,778
I was an associate
at Wheeler Law.

228
00:09:21,822 --> 00:09:23,606
I'd only been there
for a few months when my boss,

229
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:26,391
Ben Sr., shows at my place
in the middle of the night.

230
00:09:26,435 --> 00:09:28,045
He handed me a duffel bag.

231
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:29,090
Told me simply

232
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:30,439
to incinerate it.

233
00:09:30,482 --> 00:09:32,223
He said it was
for an important client:

234
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:33,660
Forest Clay.

235
00:09:33,703 --> 00:09:34,791

I don't know.

237
00:09:36,271 --> 00:09:38,752
He told me not to open it
or to ask any questions.

238
00:09:38,795 --> 00:09:40,754
And honestly, I didn't want to.

239
00:09:40,797 --> 00:09:42,625
Here's the thing, though.

240
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:44,627
There was dried blood
on the outside of that bag.

241
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:46,194
I'm certain of it.

242
00:09:46,237 --> 00:09:47,717
Yes, but it's quite a leap
to thinking

243
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:49,893
Forest killed someone then
or now, Charlotte.

244
00:09:49,937 --> 00:09:52,592
After years of working
at that firm, I know

how they operate.

I know what I helped cover up
was murder.

How about the truth.

255
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:15,049
Well, when Charlotte had her
mini-death, she went to Hell.

256
00:10:16,137 --> 00:10:17,181
Forest haunted her Hell loop

257
00:10:17,225 --> 00:10:18,661

her nightmares--

Look, I know
it sounds far-fetched,

265
00:10:31,456 --> 00:10:34,329

Eh.CHARLOTTE: Anyway,

267
00:10:36,157 --> 00:10:38,376
if Forest killed someone
13 years ago,

268
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,249
the odds that he killed again
are not unrealistic.

269
00:10:41,292 --> 00:10:44,687
Please, just look into it.

270
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:46,341

271
00:10:46,384 --> 00:10:49,344
which is investigate
everyone involved.

But until I get a new lead,

00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,217
I will start with Forest.

aren't that different.

'Cause we all know
my skills are preternatural.

But I suppose you,
on the other hand...

00:11:27,034 --> 00:11:28,513
I'm talking about the rules
of Heaven and Hell, Luci.

288
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:31,299
It's all based on
humans' subconscious,

00:11:31,342 --> 00:11:32,779
what they think they deserve.

290
00:11:32,822 --> 00:11:35,520
What if that applies
to us as well?

Right. That's enough
for you, drunky.

When I first lost my wings,

294
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,832
I thought Dad was punishing me.

295
00:11:42,876 --> 00:11:46,662
And then I thought
that you were somehow my test,

296
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,665
that in helping God's most
wayward soul, that I would

297

somehow find redemption.

298
00:11:51,798 --> 00:11:54,278
But, Luci,
I've just been guessing.

299
00:11:54,322 --> 00:11:56,150
Dad never told me any
of those things.

300
00:11:56,193 --> 00:11:58,239
Since when does Dad
ever tell us anything?

301
00:11:58,282 --> 00:12:00,241
That's exactly my point,
brother.

302
00:12:00,284 --> 00:12:03,070
What if He wants us
to judge ourselves?

303
00:12:03,113 --> 00:12:04,332
So my wings,
your wings,

305
00:12:06,813 --> 00:12:09,293
Brother, what if

306
00:12:09,337 --> 00:12:12,166
we're the ones
who control all of it?

307
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:13,558
Brother,

308
00:12:13,602 --> 00:12:17,519
that is
absolutely absurd.

309
00:12:17,562 --> 00:12:19,913
Dad holds the reins.
End of story.

310
00:12:19,956 --> 00:12:21,436
Because if we
do have control,

311
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:23,743

your wings out right now?

How dare you.

537
00:21:05,351 --> 00:21:07,309
Hey, hey. Actually,
uh, that's for me.

538
00:21:07,353 --> 00:21:08,789
Whew.

539
00:21:08,832 --> 00:21:11,618
Ah. Well, this is
like old times, isn't it?Thanks.

540
00:21:11,661 --> 00:21:13,228
Let me guess,
human head or bomb?

541
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,403
Wager, anyone?

542
00:21:14,447 --> 00:21:15,404
Funny.

543
00:21:15,448 --> 00:21:17,667
No. This is

544

545
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:21,889

Ta-da!

547
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:26,110
It's a waffle maker.

550
00:21:29,462 --> 00:21:31,551
And hers...
uh, iron is really old.

551
00:21:31,594 --> 00:21:33,466
I'm, like, the waffle king?

552
00:21:34,467 --> 00:21:36,469
Is it weird?Very. But I'm glad

553
00:21:36,512 --> 00:21:39,123
to see you're back to your
normal douchey ways, Daniel.

554
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:42,083
Well, it's between that and...

555
00:21:42,126 --> 00:21:44,041
this.

556
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,348
That's pretty.

557
00:21:46,392 --> 00:21:48,350
It's a waffle.Oh.

558
00:21:48,394 --> 00:21:49,830
That's better, right?It's still weird,

559
00:21:49,873 --> 00:21:52,093
but yes, women tend
to prefer jewelry

560
00:21:52,136 --> 00:21:53,355
over household appliances.

561
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:55,357
Not really
sure Lucifer's

562
00:21:55,401 --> 00:21:57,403
the authority
on what women want.

These are

Forest Clay and...

568
00:22:10,067 --> 00:22:11,721
14 different women.

569

Spanning two decades--
the last, Mia Hytner,

barely a week ago.

571
00:22:15,943 --> 00:22:18,815
Question: how does this
prove that Forest is
the killer, though?

572
00:22:18,859 --> 00:22:21,427
Well, 300, 400 grand a pop--
I mean, no one spends

573
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,907
that kind of money unless
they're trying to cover up

574
00:22:23,951 --> 00:22:25,561
something really bad.

575
00:22:26,606 --> 00:22:27,824
Wait.

That's right around the time

578
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:36,877
I got rid of the duffel bag.
I remember.

found strangled in a motel."

581
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,971
No way the timing
is coincidence.

582
00:22:44,014 --> 00:22:45,842
Forest killed that woman,
and the proof of it

583
00:22:45,886 --> 00:22:47,104
was in that duffel bag.Yeah,

584
00:22:47,148 --> 00:22:49,063
but not even one mention
of Forest here.

585
00:22:49,106 --> 00:22:50,064
Yeah, you're right.

586
00:22:50,107 --> 00:22:52,066
I may know that Forest did it,

587
00:22:52,109 --> 00:22:55,591
but I still can't prove it
because of what Idid.Hey, at least

588
00:22:55,635 --> 00:22:58,202
we have the victim's name now--
maybe that's gonna lead us

589
00:22:58,246 --> 00:22:59,595

how that happened.

you've been going through,

Oh, perfect-- you're
exactly where you need to be.

Who is up
for a classic game night, hmm?

Well, actually,
it's a school night for her,

617
00:24:31,165 --> 00:24:33,167

the detective... a shoe.

Lucifer?Hmm?

621
00:24:40,174 --> 00:24:41,610
This is... this is
a little weird.

622
00:24:41,654 --> 00:24:43,482
Well, if by "weird,"
you mean you're transported

623

No. I... I don't think
any of this

is really about Pierce.

687
00:27:04,231 --> 00:27:08,148
I think if I'm honest
with myself...

688
00:27:08,191 --> 00:27:10,977
all of this is about Lucifer.

689
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,457
Lucifer's the...
the reason

690
00:27:13,501 --> 00:27:15,459
that I said yes
to Pierce, and...

691
00:27:15,503 --> 00:27:18,071
he's also the reason
that I said no.

692

00:27:22,423 --> 00:27:24,599

You got it.Okay.

701
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,357
So, if Forest was the
killer's actual target,

702
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,054
what's the motive?

703
00:27:45,098 --> 00:27:46,534
I think I know.

704
00:27:46,577 --> 00:27:48,971
That's A.J. Agholor.

705
00:27:49,015 --> 00:27:50,973
In 2005, he went to jail

706
00:27:51,017 --> 00:27:52,845
for the murder of Joanne Foles.

707
00:27:52,888 --> 00:27:54,150
But A.J.
didn't do it.

708
00:27:54,194 --> 00:27:57,632
Forest did.
A.J.'s motive was revenge.

709
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,373
How did you figure
all of this out?

710
00:27:59,416 --> 00:28:02,158

that Forest paid off
for the last 20 years.

And look.

00:28:03,943 --> 00:28:08,034
Joanne signed
