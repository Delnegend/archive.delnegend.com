that's not the case here.

192
00:08:47,918 --> 00:08:50,530
Really?
Absolutely.
And I need to prove it.

193
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:51,574
And why's that?

194
00:08:51,618 --> 00:08:52,749
Because just this morning,

195

was frozen

196

on somebody else

200

202
00:09:03,978 --> 00:09:05,588
so the right person
is punished for their sins,

203
00:09:05,632 --> 00:09:07,895

corrupt little organization

204

Well, let's just say,

213
00:09:28,045 --> 00:09:29,830
I don't think I could
change anything

214
00:09:29,873 --> 00:09:32,441

our relationship less...

of a gunshot wound.

That loss changed her,

221
00:09:47,369 --> 00:09:50,633
inspired her to follow in his footsteps and become a cop.

222
00:09:50,677 --> 00:09:53,201
So what was that one
small thing I changed

223

that changed everything?

224
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:58,075

for a fight.

527
00:22:14,942 --> 00:22:16,857
Wait a minute,

528
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,032
are you Chloe Decker?

529
00:22:18,075 --> 00:22:19,686
She is.
Amazing, isn't it?

530
00:22:19,729 --> 00:22:21,731
What the hell is
going on around here?

531
00:22:21,775 --> 00:22:22,993
He was about to talk.

532
00:22:23,037 --> 00:22:24,865
Well, apologies
for the interruption.

533
00:22:24,908 --> 00:22:26,083
But if you'll allow me
to make amends,

534
00:22:26,127 --> 00:22:27,607
I've got a few skills
of my own.

535
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:30,566
Tell me... Rex...

536
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:33,395
what is it you desire?

537
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,401
REX:
Wait, I...

538
00:22:39,445 --> 00:22:43,405
want a good story.

539
00:22:43,449 --> 00:22:46,843
Wh-What...What are you
talking about?

540
00:22:48,192 --> 00:22:51,631
Uh, people, they don't
follow cars anymore.

541
00:22:51,674 --> 00:22:53,023
They follow drivers.

542
00:22:53,067 --> 00:22:56,070
Drama. Stryder's dad,
he was a NASCAR legend.

543
00:22:56,113 --> 00:22:58,420
And your biggest rival,
if I remember correctly.

544
00:22:58,464 --> 00:23:00,683
When he died,
so did my merch sales.

545
00:23:00,727 --> 00:23:02,250
So, getting Stryder
to replace him,

546
00:23:02,293 --> 00:23:03,730
that-that-that got
the rivalry back.

547
00:23:03,773 --> 00:23:05,906
Yeah, but how does that
help you? You're out of a job.

548
00:23:05,949 --> 00:23:07,298
I started a management firm

549
00:23:07,342 --> 00:23:08,865
about a year ago--
Stryder was a client.

550
00:23:08,909 --> 00:23:12,129
It was my idea to
get him to replace me.

551
00:23:12,173 --> 00:23:15,829
Poor kid. Stryder,
he... he was so happy

552
00:23:15,872 --> 00:23:17,221
when I made him
that offer.

553
00:23:17,265 --> 00:23:19,702
Well, yeah, it was an
opportunity of a lifetime.

554
00:23:19,746 --> 00:23:21,835
Apparently, he needed the money
to get him out of a jam.

555
00:23:21,878 --> 00:23:24,228
What do you mean, "jam"?

556
00:23:24,272 --> 00:23:26,405
He was having some trouble
with a guy at work.

557
00:23:31,671 --> 00:23:33,281
Uh, uh, excuse me.

558
00:23:33,324 --> 00:23:34,500
What the hell
was that back there?

559
00:23:34,543 --> 00:23:36,197
I've already apologized
for interrupting

560
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,938
your monologue,
Ms. Decker.

561
00:23:37,981 --> 00:23:40,244
No, how the hell did you
get Rex to spill like that?

562
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:43,117
Ah, well, I have the ability
to draw out people's desires.

563
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,248
Well, what are you,
psychic or something?

564
00:23:44,292 --> 00:23:46,903
No, no, I can't read
people's minds.

565
00:23:46,947 --> 00:23:48,818
I'm not a Jedi.
[chuckles]

566
00:23:48,862 --> 00:23:50,472
People just like
to tell me things.

567
00:23:50,516 --> 00:23:53,388
Okay, well, we should stop
stepping on each other's toes,

568
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,521
because we both clearly
want the same thing.

569
00:23:55,564 --> 00:23:57,958
Oh, that's very forward
of you, Ms. Decker.

570
00:23:58,001 --> 00:23:59,699
Yes, I will have sex with you.

571
00:23:59,742 --> 00:24:01,527
We should probably solve
this murder first...No, no.

572
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:03,093
I mean that we should
work together.

573
00:24:03,137 --> 00:24:05,444
[laughing]:
No.

574
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:07,271
I mean, you've proven
a very impressive adversary,

575
00:24:07,315 --> 00:24:09,491
but I'm not really
a "work together" kind of Devil.

576
00:24:09,535 --> 00:24:12,276
So...
Well, too bad.

577
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,583
Because I know who Stryder was
fighting with at work.

578
00:24:14,627 --> 00:24:17,064
Very well...

579
00:24:18,935 --> 00:24:21,460
Lead the way, Ms. Decker.
[chuckles]

580
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,508
So, the second marriage
is going well?

581
00:24:26,552 --> 00:24:28,423
Oh, totally.

582
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,207
Uh, e-even though
I've made mistakes,

583
00:24:30,251 --> 00:24:33,254
the second time around
just feels better. You know?

584
00:24:33,297 --> 00:24:34,255
Mm, yes.

585
00:24:34,298 --> 00:24:36,300
It can be hard
to trust again.

586
00:24:36,344 --> 00:24:37,911
This time I just know
she loves me for me.

587
00:24:37,954 --> 00:24:39,913
I have no doubt...

588
00:24:39,956 --> 00:24:41,567
that you'll stay with us.

589
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:46,746
More with box office sensation
Nathan Fury when we come back.

590
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:49,444
And cut.[set bell rings]

591
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:53,927
Wow, Linda, every day I am
in awe watching you work.

592
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:57,234
Oh... [chuckles]
Thank you, Stacy.

593
00:24:57,278 --> 00:24:58,801
Uh, when we come
back from break,

594
00:24:58,845 --> 00:25:01,108
ask him how he feels about
his new wife cheating on him.

595
00:25:01,151 --> 00:25:04,503
Can you just give us one second,
please? Thank you.

596
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:05,721
Wait, what?

597
00:25:05,765 --> 00:25:07,636
Our investigator
caught her on tape

598
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,900
kissing her costar
at the Farmer's Market.

599
00:25:10,944 --> 00:25:11,945
Juicy, right?

600
00:25:11,988 --> 00:25:13,947
No. My God,
that's terrible.

601
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,775
That's going to
devastate Nathan.

602
00:25:15,818 --> 00:25:17,298
And make great TV.

603
00:25:17,341 --> 00:25:21,607
As his therapist,
I can't in good conscience

604
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:22,869
incite a breakdown.

605
00:25:22,912 --> 00:25:24,174
That's not why I do this.

606
00:25:24,218 --> 00:25:26,481
And that is why America
loves you, Linda.

607
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,309
But you know what else
America loves?

608
00:25:28,352 --> 00:25:29,266
Tears.

609
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,964
But Stacy, you can't...

610
00:25:31,007 --> 00:25:32,182
Ratings are down.

611
00:25:32,226 --> 00:25:35,055
We need a boost like this.

612
00:25:35,098 --> 00:25:36,535
What's more important
to you?

613
00:25:46,675 --> 00:25:47,981
WOMAN:
Set.

614
00:25:48,024 --> 00:25:50,505
Aah! [grunts]

615
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,507
That's who was arguing
with your stuntman?

616
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,378
Lara Croft wannabe?
WOMAN:
What the hell, Rogers?

617
00:25:54,422 --> 00:25:56,337
Erika Dunlap.
My costar.

618
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,034
I told you that move
wouldn't work.

619
00:25:58,078 --> 00:25:59,427
Why don't you ever
listen to me?

620
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:01,429
Well, she seems to be fighting
with a lot of people.

621
00:26:01,472 --> 00:26:03,997
Well, her beef with Stryder
was a lot bigger.

622
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,215
LUCIFER:
Oh?

623
00:26:05,259 --> 00:26:06,695
ROGERS: Chloe, what
are you doing here?

624
00:26:06,739 --> 00:26:08,088
You on the schedule today?

625
00:26:08,131 --> 00:26:09,655
Hey, Ben. I just forgot
some things in my trailer.

626
00:26:09,698 --> 00:26:11,657
But what's going on
with Erika lately?

627
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,572
I mean, she was giving
Stryder grief, too,

628
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:14,747
the last time I saw her.

629
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,313
Everyone deals with
death differently.

630
00:26:16,357 --> 00:26:18,098
In Erika's case, she
deals by taking it out

631
00:26:18,141 --> 00:26:20,013
on my entire stunt team.Lovely.

632
00:26:20,056 --> 00:26:21,884
Nothing we can't handle.

633
00:26:21,928 --> 00:26:23,582
Sorry.
Yeah.

634
00:26:25,453 --> 00:26:27,237
All right, when you're finished
having a catch-up...

635
00:26:27,281 --> 00:26:29,283
What?What was the bigger beef?

636
00:26:29,326 --> 00:26:33,156
Uh, well, Erika got
hurt during a stunt

637
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,549
and she was looking forward

638
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,856
to a hefty settlement, but
her eyewitness, Stryder,

639
00:26:36,899 --> 00:26:38,509
refused to testify on her behalf

640
00:26:38,553 --> 00:26:41,687
and it-it didn't go over well
with Erika.

641
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:44,559
Oh, so you think she killed him
out of revenge?

642
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,300
Or knowing that without
an eyewitness,

643
00:26:46,343 --> 00:26:48,041
she'd have a better chance
at winning the case.

644
00:26:48,084 --> 00:26:49,608
And reap the windfall.

645
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:51,653
Right. You know,
I'd go talk to Erika,

646
00:26:51,697 --> 00:26:54,482
but she and I don't
exactly see eye-to-eye.

647
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:58,704
I've seen what you
can do to people.

648
00:26:58,747 --> 00:27:01,663
Erika's trailer
is right there.

649
00:27:01,707 --> 00:27:05,580
Why don't you go
and, you know,

650
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,060
do your thing?

651
00:27:07,103 --> 00:27:08,757
Ah.

652
00:27:13,153 --> 00:27:15,068
I mean...Monkey?

653
00:27:15,111 --> 00:27:17,897
Dad. Hi. What-what
are you doing here?

654
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,855
Well, I've been hearing
some crazy stories.

655
00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:23,642
You didn't sneak into
a NASCAR race, right?

656
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:26,732
And you definitely didn't
impersonate a cop?

657
00:27:26,775 --> 00:27:28,647
Okay, Dad, it's not what
you're thinking.

658
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,257
Good, 'cause if
you're still working

659
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,433
with that mentally ill nightclub
owner, w-what's-his-name.

660
00:27:32,476 --> 00:27:34,478
ERIKA [ecstatic]:
Lucifer!

661
00:27:34,522 --> 00:27:36,002
Lucifer!
LUCIFER:
That's right,

662
00:27:36,045 --> 00:27:38,744
say my name. Say my name.[Erika moaning in pleasure]

663
00:27:43,531 --> 00:27:45,228
CHARLOTTE:
Lucifer?

664
00:27:45,272 --> 00:27:48,579
Is anyone here?

665
00:28:04,552 --> 00:28:05,771
Lucifer?

666
00:28:13,126 --> 00:28:15,258
[sighs]

667
00:28:19,045 --> 00:28:20,829
Jackpot.

668
00:28:42,503 --> 00:28:45,636
Um, I work for Lucifer.

669
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,638
He sent me here to
get the cash for...

670
00:28:47,682 --> 00:28:49,205
I don't care
about the money.

671
00:28:49,249 --> 00:28:50,598
You don't?

672
00:28:50,641 --> 00:28:53,732
I care about why you want it.

673
00:28:56,517 --> 00:28:58,693
Tell me the truth
and it's yours.

674
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:02,392
Lucifer needs it

675
00:29:02,436 --> 00:29:04,133
to finish the
Vegas deal.

676
00:29:04,177 --> 00:29:05,308
[sighs]

677
00:29:05,352 --> 00:29:08,268
Because I deserve it.

678
00:29:15,449 --> 00:29:17,233
What would you do with it?

679
00:29:17,277 --> 00:29:20,671
Whatever I damn well want.

680
00:29:20,715 --> 00:29:24,675
I'll take that
as a promise.

681
00:29:28,941 --> 00:29:30,464
Go.

682
00:29:30,507 --> 00:29:34,424
Embrace your deepest,
darkest desire.

683
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:39,560
Let those sinful little embers
burn into a flame.

684
00:29:42,302 --> 00:29:43,607
Why?

685
00:29:43,651 --> 00:29:47,220
We'll meet again...
eventually.

686
00:29:47,263 --> 00:29:50,440
Somewhere hotter.

687
00:29:50,484 --> 00:29:52,791
And the more you sin,

688
00:29:52,834 --> 00:29:55,315
the more fun it'll be for me.

689
00:29:56,882 --> 00:29:58,927
Think of this as foreplay.

690
00:30:03,192 --> 00:30:04,803
However...

691
00:30:04,846 --> 00:30:10,330
if I ever see you and that
boy toy in Los Angeles again,

692
00:30:10,373 --> 00:30:13,463
I will gut that pretty
belly of yours.

693
00:30:13,507 --> 00:30:18,468
Everyone knows you don't
steal from the Devil.

694
00:30:23,212 --> 00:30:24,735
JOHN:
Do you have any idea

695
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:27,782
what a difficult situation
you've put me in?

696
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,088
Dad, I had to do something.

697
00:30:29,131 --> 00:30:31,090
Okay? Stryder wasn't killed
in a bar fight.

698
00:30:31,133 --> 00:30:33,614
And we are on to something.
I can feel it.

699
00:30:33,657 --> 00:30:36,008
"We"?
LUCIFER:

Well, your plan worked wonders.

well and truly pumped.

for information.

What happened to doing
your hypno-eye thing?

706
00:30:51,937 --> 00:30:53,068

Oh.

707
00:30:53,112 --> 00:30:54,765

That's what you meant.
Yes.

708
00:30:54,809 --> 00:30:56,463
Oh, no, we went at it
like little bunnies.

709
00:30:56,506 --> 00:30:58,291
Next time you should be
more specific.

710
00:30:58,334 --> 00:31:00,771
There will be no "next time."

711
00:31:00,815 --> 00:31:03,035
I raised you better
than this, Chloe.

714
00:31:06,821 --> 00:31:08,997
Right. Well,
from what I've seen,

715
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:11,913
what you've raised is
an intelligent, capable

716
00:31:11,957 --> 00:31:14,524
and frustratingly
stubborn woman.

00:31:14,568 --> 00:31:16,048
Don't talk to me
about my daughter.

718
00:31:16,091 --> 00:31:17,919

thought he'd be proud of me.

Well, disappointing fathers is
a rite of passage, Ms. Decker.

Take it from someone
who's made a living out of it.

No, no, he's right.

726

He's right. I'm not a cop.

727
00:31:35,502 --> 00:31:37,025
I'm an actress.

728
00:31:37,069 --> 00:31:41,160
I mean... who really thought
that I could solve a murder?

729
00:31:41,203 --> 00:31:42,639
Well, I did.

730
00:31:43,292 --> 00:31:44,685
And I still do.

731
00:31:44,728 --> 00:31:47,949
There's no evidence,
not of anything.

732
00:31:47,993 --> 00:31:49,255
That's not necessarily true,

733
00:31:49,298 --> 00:31:50,778
'cause I just learned that
that Erika woman

734
00:31:50,821 --> 00:31:52,084
can put her ankles
around my neck.

735
00:31:52,127 --> 00:31:54,913
Okay, that's really
not helping right now.

736
00:31:54,956 --> 00:31:56,784
Thank you.

737
00:31:56,827 --> 00:31:58,438
Wait, if she was
really injured,

738
00:31:58,481 --> 00:31:59,613
she wouldn't be
able to do that.

739
00:31:59,656 --> 00:32:01,963
Precisely.
She was faking her injury.

740
00:32:02,007 --> 00:32:04,444
[laughs] And she was very
generous with information

741
00:32:04,487 --> 00:32:05,749

with the ol...

742
00:32:05,793 --> 00:32:07,012
Okay, I don't want to know.

743
00:32:07,055 --> 00:32:09,928
Okay. Well, she said
that she needed money

744
00:32:09,971 --> 00:32:13,105
and that Stryder refused
to lie on her behalf.

745
00:32:13,148 --> 00:32:14,758
But then he said he was coming
into a windfall

746
00:32:14,802 --> 00:32:16,195
and could help her out.

747
00:32:16,238 --> 00:32:17,805
Apparently he and a partner
were planning on stealing

748
00:32:17,848 --> 00:32:19,589
something very valuable
from set.

749
00:32:19,633 --> 00:32:21,504
So maybe Stryder was
backing out of this heist

750
00:32:21,548 --> 00:32:22,766
to have a shot at NASCAR.

751
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:24,072
Well, his partner
wouldn't take kindly

752
00:32:24,116 --> 00:32:26,031
to being left high and dry, now,
would he?

753
00:32:26,074 --> 00:32:27,423
No. He wouldn't.

754
00:32:27,467 --> 00:32:30,818
So, does that mean
you're still in, Detective?

755
00:32:30,861 --> 00:32:34,082
How do we figure out who Stryder
was working with on set?

756
00:32:34,126 --> 00:32:38,217
Perhaps the murder weapon
will help narrow it down.

I've ever shown
any interest in your job,

you-you either change the
subject, or you push me away?

wanted to become a cop?

scare me as much

916

in those situations.

you could handle it.
