1
00:00:01,269 --> 00:00:03,771
Previously on Lucifer...
He is so into you.

2
00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:05,339
You're joking.
Uh, no.

3
00:00:05,373 --> 00:00:08,242
Scorching fire, five-alarm.

4
00:00:08,276 --> 00:00:10,478
I can see why Lucifer
is so affected by you.

5
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:12,646
It's because you're
special, Decker.

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,748
Being a celestial insider...

7
00:00:14,782 --> 00:00:16,250
really sucks.

8
00:00:16,284 --> 00:00:19,353
I was in a really
dark place, but someone

9
00:00:19,387 --> 00:00:20,754
helped me gain perspective.

10
00:00:20,788 --> 00:00:23,457
LUCIFER: Now Maze is off
bounty hunting again.

11
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:25,426
ELLA:
Being good takes practice.

12
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:28,129
Keep at it
and you'll get better.

13
00:00:28,162 --> 00:00:29,663
I guess I should
take that job then.

14
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:32,333
What job?
The Sinnerman is not a myth.

15
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,802
I butted heads with him in
Chicago. Did not end well.

16
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:37,571
LUCIFER:
Not only did he stick my wings
back on and take my face,

17
00:00:37,605 --> 00:00:39,440
he's stolen my schtick,
as well.

18
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:40,841
He gives out favors to people.

19
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,376
And I think that maybe

20
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,612
it's about time
I got back in the game.

21
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:48,316
*

22
00:00:55,356 --> 00:00:57,858
* We are the way out

23
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,294
* We are the ones you loathe

24
00:01:00,328 --> 00:01:02,730
* Call us the wrong crowd

25
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:05,566
* We'll never walk alone

26
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:12,273
* Don't need no savior

27
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:13,407
* Don't need a hand...

28
00:01:13,441 --> 00:01:15,576
Line's back there, buddy.

29
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:17,111
Is the, uh,

30
00:01:17,145 --> 00:01:18,612
big guy in tonight?

31
00:01:18,646 --> 00:01:20,848
* We have gone too far
to turn around *

32
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:22,350
This is a one.

33
00:01:22,383 --> 00:01:24,318
* We move too fast
to keep us down *

34
00:01:24,352 --> 00:01:26,320
Nice guy discount?

35
00:01:26,354 --> 00:01:29,323
* We are, we are,
we are the reckless *

36
00:01:29,357 --> 00:01:30,724
Make it quick, kid.

37
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:34,728
You're a prince.

38
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:35,829
Thank you.

39
00:01:35,863 --> 00:01:38,166
*

40
00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:40,601
* The reckless

41
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:42,270
*

42
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:45,239
* We are the reckless

43
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:50,878
* Go on and chase us

44
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:52,513
* We can't be caught, oh, no

45
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:54,215
* Call us contagious

46
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:55,683
Hey.

47
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:57,518
Uh, Mr. Morningstar?

48
00:01:57,551 --> 00:01:59,287
I hear you're the guy
to talk to.

49
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,222
I hear you help people.

50
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:02,423
(laughs)
What, like Ellen?

51
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:03,524
(laughs)

52
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:04,692
I think not.

53
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:07,361
(laughs)

54
00:02:07,395 --> 00:02:09,363
No, I grant people favors.

55
00:02:09,397 --> 00:02:11,399
When it suits me.

56
00:02:11,432 --> 00:02:13,667
Well, I-I could use a favor.

57
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:17,238
Hear me out, Mr. Morningstar.

58
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:18,506
You won't regret it.

59
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,576
Victoria, give us a minute,
would you, girl?

60
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,478
* Ain't no way
we're stopping now *

61
00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:28,649
* Ain't no way we're
stopping now *

62
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:31,185
* We are, we are,
we are the reckless *

63
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:32,653
Call me Lucifer.

64
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:34,355
Joey Pileggi.

65
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:35,956
So, Joey Pileggi,

66
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,725
what is it you desire?

67
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:41,262
LINDA: Okay, so,
how do you angels work?

68
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:44,398
I know Amenadiel
can slow time,

69
00:02:44,432 --> 00:02:47,568
and your other brother Uriel
could predict patterns.

70
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:50,304
So why is your
gift desire?

71
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:51,839
(sighs) Well,

72
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:53,541
that's a good question,
actually, I suppose.

73
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:55,843
When I first went
to angel school,

74
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:59,447
they sorted us into different
houses for different powers.

75
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,848
There's a school for angels?

76
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,484
No.
(laughs)

77
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:07,555
(laughing):
There's no Hogwarts in the sky.

78
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:10,324
(laughing):
Right. Obviously.

79
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:16,330
Are you using humor to deflect
my very reasonable question?

80
00:03:16,364 --> 00:03:18,966
(sighs)
Look, if you must know,

81
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:20,901
we were all born this way,

82
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,003
each with our own
God-given abilities.

83
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,872
But what came first?

84
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:28,476
Do angels' powers shape
their personalities?

85
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:31,745
Or are your personalities
shaped by your powers?

86
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:33,347
Haven't a clue.

87
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:38,486
Look, all I know is that
my powers are perfect for me.

88
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,654
Desire is the ultimate
expression of free will.

89
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:44,358
I help people do whatever--
or whomever-- they want.

90
00:03:44,392 --> 00:03:46,394
But that's it?

91
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:49,363
There isn't more to it?

92
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:51,799
(sighs)

93
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,909
Sorry.
(clears throat)

94
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:04,545
I-I should have knocked.
It's a late night.

95
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:05,813
Been trying to catch up
on all the work

96
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:08,282
since I got out
of the hospital.

97
00:04:08,316 --> 00:04:09,917
Stole a couple hours
on the couch.

98
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,787
Um, thank you again...

99
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:15,423
for saving my life.

100
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:17,525
It's, uh...

101
00:04:17,558 --> 00:04:19,427
Looks like you're,
you're healing really well.

102
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,762
It still hurts
like a son of a bitch.

103
00:04:23,431 --> 00:04:24,565
You know what? I'll, um...

104
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:25,799
I'll just come back
another time.

105
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,768
Now's good. What do
you want, Decker?

106
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,808
Uh, I wanted to request
a personal day.

107
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:37,044
What for?

108
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:38,546
Well, it's personal.

109
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:40,681
I'll take it under advisement.

110
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:42,950
I didn't think
it'd be an issue.

111
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:50,090
CHLOE:
It's just one personal day.

112
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,892
I never ask for anything.

113
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:53,594
You're too low-
maintenance, Detective.

114
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,696
People assume work
is your only desire.

115
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:57,064
Yeah, well, it's not.

116
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:58,466
Yeah, what a jerk.

117
00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:00,368
Oh, look who's all
hot and bothered.

118
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:01,902
Someone got under
your skin.

119
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:04,438
(chuckles) What do you want
with a personal day anyway?

120
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:06,540
It's personal.

121
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:12,446
(sighs) Looks like some sort of
poor man's penthouse, isn't it?

122
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,947
(camera snaps)
Hmm.

123
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,583
CHLOE:
Boy, he's young.

124
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:18,018
Practically a kid.
ELLA: Yeah.

125
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:21,589
What happened here?
Who would have done this?

126
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:22,923
I'm afraid I might know.

127
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:27,661
You see, I did
this young man a favor.

128
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,931
*

129
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:41,108
CHLOE:
Lucifer, can I talk to you?

130
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:46,847
What exactly does this
have to do with you?

131
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,482
Well, his name's Joey.

132
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:50,884
Joey Pileggi, he came
to me a few months ago

133
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:53,086
and asked me for a favor,
and I granted it to him.

134
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,888
You're still doing that?
(laughs)

135
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:57,691
I'd never stop
granting favors, Detective.

136
00:05:57,725 --> 00:06:00,694
I mean, I may have gotten
distracted for a while,

137
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:02,496
but then I realized
granting favors defines me.

138
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:05,032
I mean, you wouldn't ask
Superman not to fly?

139
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:06,700
A Kardashian
not to selfie?

140
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:08,902
So I started up again and it was
going splendidly, until...

141
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:12,506
What kind of favor? And don't
tell me it got Joey killed.

142
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,509
Well, his desire was to become
the new Godfather,

143
00:06:15,543 --> 00:06:17,445
a Scarface for millennials.

144
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:18,712
You introduced him to the mob?

145
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:20,881
I may have gotten him
an internship.

146
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:22,816
(indistinct police radio
chatter)

147
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,017
Ella.

148
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,019
What do you have
on the cause of death?

149
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:27,655
Two gunshot wounds
to the chest,

150
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:29,523
and his legs were broken.

151
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:30,924
Practically
shattered.

152
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,527
But here's the weird part.
I thought that the killer

153
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:35,429
broke Joey's legs first--
you know, torturing him

154
00:06:35,463 --> 00:06:36,997
before killing him--
but look.

155
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,766
Minimal hemorrhaging.

156
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:40,100
That's when I realized

157
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,069
Joey's legs were
broken postmortem.

158
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:45,473
Why? What's the killer
trying to say?

159
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:46,807
(quietly):
Oh, no.

160
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,975
What?

161
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:51,912
Well, it may be a commentary
on the job that I got for him.

162
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:55,583
As a runner for the mob.

163
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:02,956
(laughing): Angel school?
LINDA: Okay, what?

164
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,525
It's not that funny, okay.

165
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:05,959
(laughing continues)

166
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:08,762
Okay. Okay, it's
kind of funny.

167
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:11,131
You really thought
angel school was a thing?

168
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:12,800
How was I supposed to know?

169
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:13,734
What's crazier,

170
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,704
angel school, or that
you can slow time,

171
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:18,906
or that Lucifer can draw
out people's desires?

172
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:21,174
Okay, I can see how
that would seem strange.

173
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,577
No, it's bananas,
Amenadiel.

174
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:26,046
I mean, how does
any of it all work?

175
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,648
Like...

176
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:31,919
why is your power
slowing down time?

177
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,954
(sighs)

178
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:36,590
Maybe my Father wanted me
to be a better emissary,

179
00:07:36,624 --> 00:07:38,492
someone who could
fix things on Earth

180
00:07:38,526 --> 00:07:40,193
and stay invisible.

181
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:43,531
So, I can slow down time
and do His bidding

182
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:45,933
without anyone being the wiser.

183
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:49,036
That seems really...

184
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:50,604
sad.

185
00:07:50,638 --> 00:07:52,105
What do you mean?
I mean,

186
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,241
it... it just seems lonely

187
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:58,879
to visit humanity without ever
really getting to know anyone.

188
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:03,584
I guess I was never told
to avoid humanity.

189
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:07,555
It just seemed easier.

190
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:11,692
And quite honestly,
I never saw the point.

191
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,562
Until recently.

192
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:18,265
Hey, stranger...

193
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:19,567
LINDA:
Maze!

194
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,602
You're back!
Yeah!

195
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:23,537
Oh, I missed you,
too, girl.

196
00:08:23,571 --> 00:08:25,939
Where was your bounty
this time, Mazikeen?

197
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:27,074
Uh, Cleveland.

198
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:28,809
(sighs): Now I'm
banned in Ohio.

199
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:31,144
Ah.
So, uh, what's
going on?

200
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:32,813
What are you
guys up to?

201
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:33,881
(laughs)

202
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:35,215
Okay. Well, Linda...

203
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:38,251
Linda was just catching me up
on how sh...

204
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:42,022
(laughs): on how she believed
in "angel school."

205
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:43,824
(chuckles):
Oh.

206
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:47,160
You... guys
catch up, huh?

207
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,563
Yes. Yeah, we...
we've been hanging out.

208
00:08:49,597 --> 00:08:50,998
Yeah, we're friends.

209
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:53,601
Right.

210
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:56,737
Right. Friends.
(chuckles)

211
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,840
ELLA: It's not
just any shoe.

212
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,975
Joey's high-tops were
limited edition.

213
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:03,877
Easily worth
a grand a pair.

214
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:06,079
I mean, my brothers
would flip over these.

215
00:09:06,113 --> 00:09:07,615
Sweet kicks indeed.

216
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:09,116
Sorry I'm late.

217
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,317
CHLOE:
Charlotte.

218
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,819
What are you
doing here?

219
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:13,220
Little early for
opposing counsel.

220
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:14,221
Are you defending
someone?

221
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:15,589
CHARLOTTE:
No.

222
00:09:15,623 --> 00:09:16,824
I quit my job.

223
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:18,992
Oh. Well, good for you,
Charlotte.

224
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:20,360
Had enough of life

225
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,962
as a corrupt defense
lawyer, have you?

226
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:23,831
That'll help keep
your ledger clear.

227
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:26,266
Today is my first day in the
district attorney's office--

228
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:27,968
as a prosecutor.

229
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:29,202
I'm on your side now.

230
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:30,938
Surprise.
(chuckles)

231
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:31,739
Did you know about this?

232
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:33,974
Not a clue.
How did this happen?

233
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:36,009
Who knows
how these things happen?

234
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:37,577
So random.

235
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:40,213
Guess we should get back
to the case, right?

236
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,149
Right.
Right.

237
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:44,952
So, Joey had expensive shoes,

238
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:46,186
plus...

239
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:47,855
a real Rolex

240
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:51,725
and ten grand stashed
under his bed.

241
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:52,926
But Joey worked for the mob.
I mean,

242
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,695
wouldn't that explain
all the swag?

243
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:56,396
Runners for the mob
don't make that kind of money.

244
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,031
There's no way
he could afford that.

245
00:09:58,065 --> 00:10:00,634
Maybe Joey was skimming
off the top.

246
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:03,136
No, you don't have to
raise your hand.

247
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:06,006
Okay, well, um, his bosses
wouldn't like that.

248
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:06,974
They would
execute Joey

249
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:09,076
to send a message to
the whole organization.

250
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,278
Whoever brought him in
would do the deed.

251
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:12,980
Lovely.

252
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:14,948
What? I know
how these guys work.

253
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:17,284
I've represented mobsters
like this for years.

254
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:19,687
Alleged mobsters.

255
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,790
(sighs) Who did you
introduce Joey to?

256
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:24,658
Frankie the Knife.
Sweet chap.

257
00:10:24,692 --> 00:10:25,926
Sounds like
a peach.

258
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,160
CHLOE: All right,
let's bring in Frankie

259
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:29,196
and see where
Joey's education went wrong.

260
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:30,831
Right.

261
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:34,201
LINDA:
Okay, that was weird.

262
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:35,703
Is it...

263
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:37,270
weird for...

264
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,972
us to be friends?

265
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:41,308
No.

266
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:43,310
Of course not.

267
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:44,812
I mean, can't a...

268
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:48,081
Can't a woman
be friends with a...

269
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:50,083
with a brilliant,

270
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:52,185
tall,

271
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:54,054
gorgeous angel?

272
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:57,224
Well, can't an angel
be friends with a...

273
00:10:57,257 --> 00:11:00,393
amazing, accomplished...

274
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:03,330
...beautiful,

275
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:05,966
and passionate woman?

276
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,281
Um...

277
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:24,084
I can't.

278
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:28,221
This is a mistake.

279
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,125
Okay.

280
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:35,462
Okay.

281
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:38,231
Okay. I'm so sorry, Linda.

282
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:48,375
Detective, Lucifer.
Are you about to talk

283
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:50,077
to Frankie the Knife?
Yep.

284
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,045
Well, I can help. I know him.
(phone vibrates)

285
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,280
I defended him once.

286
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:54,481
Unknown caller?

287
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:56,083
Um...

288
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:58,986
Look, why don't you give
the newbie a shot, Detective.

289
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,054
I mean, I for one would love an
audience when I ream Frankie

290
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:01,989
for what he did.

291
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:04,157
No one will be reaming anyone.

292
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:06,126
Fine, Charlotte.

293
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,427
Just keep a low profile.

294
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,962
You won't even know I'm there.

295
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:12,165
Hello, Frankie.

296
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:14,835
Mr. Ferrante.
I'm Detective Decker.

297
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:16,970
We know each other quite
well, don't we, Frankie?

298
00:12:17,004 --> 00:12:18,772
Not sure we've met, buddy.

299
00:12:18,806 --> 00:12:20,073
Oh, please.

300
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:21,909
And this is...
Charlotte Richards?

301
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:24,177
How are you?
How are the kids?

302
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:25,478
Hi, Frankie.

303
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:27,080
Man, the guys
are sure gonna be jealous

304
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:28,448
when they hear
you're defending me.

305
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,283
Look, Frankie,
I'm not your lawyer.

306
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:31,919
I'm the prosecutor.

307
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:33,520
I work with
the cops now.

308
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:34,922
Against you.

309
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:36,423
What's the world coming to?

310
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:37,791
Yeah, tell me about it.

311
00:12:37,825 --> 00:12:38,926
LUCIFER: What
happened, Frankie?

312
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,194
You were supposed to
mentor Joey Pileggi,

313
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:42,295
not kill him.

314
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:43,931
I got no idea about any killing.

315
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:45,465
LUCIFER: Oh, did
Joey steal from you,

316
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,267
so you made
a brutal example of him?

317
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,468
Well, guess what?

318
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:51,104
I love making brutal
examples of people.

319
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:52,105
Like I said,

320
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:54,908
I don't know any Joey,
and I don't know you.

321
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:58,511
CHLOE:
You do know him.

322
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,216
Yeah, I might've seen him once.

323
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,384
It's hard to say.

324
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:07,855
Is it true you're the head
of the Ferrante mob family?

325
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:09,189
LUCIFER:
Well, come on.

326
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:12,025
Answer her.
You do not need to answer that.

327
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:13,226
I don't?

328
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:17,064
But it would be helpful
if you did.

329
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:18,932
Right. Enough of this
"bad cop, worse cop."

330
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:21,468
Tell me, Frankie.

331
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,270
What is it you really want?

332
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:27,374
I want to find out
who killed little Joey,

333
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:29,309
and I want payback.

334
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:32,379
Oh.

335
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,916
He was...

336
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:37,517
He was such a good kid,
that Joey.

337
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,352
A real go-getter.

338
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:41,254
We all loved him.
He had a real bright future.

339
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:43,957
We found quite a bit
of contraband on him.

340
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,260
Did he ever steal anything
from you?

341
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:48,962
Joey? Never.

342
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:51,331
Everything he had
he got from us.

343
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:53,200
Oh, quite the lavish employers,
aren't you?

344
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:56,303
Hey, me and the fellas, we're
real generous to our family.

345
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,605
'Cause that's
who he was: family.

346
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:02,342
If there's anything I can do
to help with Joey's killer,

347
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:05,045
you let me know, 'cause I would
love to bring him in.

348
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:07,080
(whispers):
That means he would kill him.

349
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:09,616
Oh, thank you, Charlotte.

350
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:13,520
Thanks.

351
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:16,056
Hey, Chloe?
Yes.

352
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:17,925
(Dan clears throat)

353
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,426
I don't think
Frankie's our guy.

354
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:20,961
His alibi checks out.

355
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:23,430
Look what just came in.

356
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:25,298
Lucifer.

357
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:26,666
We got another body.

358
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,368
Let's go.

359
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:40,080
Double tap to the chest,
just like Joey.

360
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:43,383
Detective, I know
this woman.

361
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,584
What?

362
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:47,354
I did her a favor,
too, years ago.

363
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:51,358
This isn't just a murder.
It's another message.

364
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,393
For me.

365
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:59,666
Someone was definitely
sending a message.

366
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,201
Frieda Marquez, 36.

367
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:04,471
The noose was made
out of her own hair.

368
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:06,073
How twisted is that?

369
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:08,208
But hanging wasn't
what killed her.

370
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,210
She died from two
gunshots to the chest.

371
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,245
So the killer arranged her
after he killed her,

372
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,013
just like with Joey.

373
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:14,982
LUCIFER: We need
to find the man

374
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:16,249
who did this
and punish him.

375
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:18,018
CHLOE: Lucifer, what
do you know about her?

376
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:20,220
Frieda wanted to become a
hairstylist to the stars,

377
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:23,523
so I made a few choice
introductions, that's all.

378
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:26,126
I can't believe you knew Frieda.

379
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,995
Her hair products are huge.

380
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:29,963
She had salons
all over the city,

381
00:15:29,997 --> 00:15:31,564
a whole beauty empire.

382
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,400
I use her finishing
cream every day.

383
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:36,169
Right. Well, then I guess
she got what she wanted.

384
00:15:36,203 --> 00:15:37,137
Until now.

385
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,406
CHLOE:
Thanks, Ella.

386
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,008
Can I talk to you?

387
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:44,177
If these messages really are
for you, I'm worried.

388
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:45,412
Who's sending them?

389
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,147
What are they trying to say?

390
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,349
Detective, I wasn't
entirely forthcoming earlier.

391
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:52,585
The real reason I started
granting favors again

392
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,254
was because of the Sinnerman.

393
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,623
Lucifer,
I've told you this before,

394
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:58,625
I haven't seen any shred
of evidence

395
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:00,227
that this guy really exists.

396
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,229
Well, now might be the time
to become a believer,

397
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:05,132
because this appears to be his
way of escalating our rivalry.

398
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:07,067
You think this is the same guy
that kidnapped you

399
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,268
and dumped you in the desert?

400
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,703
Amongst other things, yes.
Okay, well,

401
00:16:10,737 --> 00:16:12,305
I'm gonna need proof
that this guy is real.

402
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:13,506
PIERCE:
Oh, he is real.

403
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,142
And very dangerous.

404
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:16,709
His organization has
been wreaking havoc

405
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:18,445
in the Midwest for years.

406
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:21,348
I ran into him in Chicago.
I couldn't get my hands on him.

407
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:23,716
See? It's the one thing
the lieutenant and I agree on:

408
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,717
our common enemy,

409
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:26,453
the Sinnerman.

410
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,654
So you two discussed this?

411
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:29,122
When were you gonna fill me in?

412
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:30,557
It's a need-to-know basis
only, Decker.

413
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,624
Feel free to blame me.

414
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,726
Hmm.
The thing is,

415
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,395
this does not seem
like the Sinnerman.

416
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:37,197
He kills for power
and influence.
(phone vibrates)

417
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,466
Taunting a nightclub
owner seems petty, small.

418
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,235
Well, perhaps you don't know
the full story.

419
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,438
Okay, we're gonna
treat this murder

420
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:46,773
as we would any other crime:

421
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:48,775
we follow the evidence
till we find the truth,

422
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:50,310
Sinnerman or not.

423
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:53,080
Sorry, but I don't
have time for that.

424
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:53,780
Lucifer,

425
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:55,348
where are you going?

426
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:58,051
*

427
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:01,754
Brother!

428
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:03,756
I'm about to tear
the criminal underworld apart

429
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,225
looking for
this Sinnerman fellow.

430
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:08,361
I'd appreciate your help.
Call me back.

431
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:10,497
Oh, also, it's Lucifer.

432
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,332
Good luck with that.

433
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:15,068
He's probably too busy
with Linda to answer.

434
00:17:15,102 --> 00:17:17,237
Mazikeen, you're back!

435
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,506
(chuckles)
I love the hair.

436
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,108
Can we talk?

437
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:23,243
We certainly can.
Good timing. I need your help.

438
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:25,212
Hang on. Do you even care
what I was about to say?

439
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:27,780
Of course I do. It's just that
my current problem is important.

440
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:30,117
Well, how do you know
my thing isn't important?

441
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,784
Okay. Fine. What is it?

442
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:33,153
Did...
(phone vibrates)

443
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:35,155
(sighs)
Sorry, just...

444
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:37,724
(groans) Telemarketers. They've
been hounding me all day.

445
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:39,626
This won't take long. Hello?

446
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:41,828
Unbelievable.

447
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:43,630
Look, whatever it is
you're selling,

448
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:45,132
I'm not interested, so...

449
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:47,134
SINNERMAN:
Really?

450
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:50,237
And I thought
you were looking for me.

451
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:54,141
ELLA:
It's the Sinnerman.

452
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:56,243
You got the Sinnerman's
DNA profile?

453
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:58,811
How?
Our second vic, Frieda--

454
00:17:58,845 --> 00:18:00,413
total fighter.

455
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:02,282
She struggled with the killer
and scratched him.

456
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:05,485
So I checked out her fingernail
scrapings and found

457
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:07,220
blood and skin cells.

458
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:09,222
And came up
with the killer's DNA.

459
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:11,591
Which matches a hair that
I recovered from Joey's place.

460
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:13,226
So, boom,

461
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,295
we can place the killer
at both scenes.

462
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:18,165
But, that's not even
the cool part.

463
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:21,568
I did some more digging
and found a perfect match

464
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,436
with a blood spatter sample

465
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,405
from an old Sinnerman case

466
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,639
in Chicago.

467
00:18:26,673 --> 00:18:29,876
Proving that Pierce's Sinnerman
really is operating in L.A.

468
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:31,778
Ella, you're a miracle worker.

469
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:33,413
Aw, no biggie.

470
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,583
My peeps in Detroit made
some calls to Chicago PD for me.

471
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:39,186
Meant hours of sifting
through case files, but,

472
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:40,687
you know, I just put on

473
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,223
my Beastie Boys
and powered through.

474
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,461
Decker, did you hear
what I said?

475
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:49,462
What?

476
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:50,830
Hmm? Sorry. No.

477
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:53,166
Aw, never mind.

478
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:55,568
Man, I can't believe nothing

479
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:57,737
ever sparked between you
and the lieutenant.

480
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,839
I could've sworn
you guys had chemistry.

481
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:01,374
No.

482
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:02,542
No chemistry.

483
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:05,445
Well, win some,
lose some, I guess.
That's right.

484
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,680
That is right.
Okay, I'm gonna call Lucifer.

485
00:19:07,714 --> 00:19:09,382
Awesome work. Hey, Lucifer,

486
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:12,452
you were right. Call me back.
Try not to gloat too much.

487
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,954
Oh, easy, Decker.
What's the rush?

488
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,289
Hey, Lieutenant.

489
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:18,225
Um, so Ella found
the Sinnerman's DNA

490
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:20,260
at both scenes,
and I think we can use that

491
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:21,594
to lean on Frankie Ferrante.

492
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:23,230
That's promising.

493
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,664
Where's Lucifer?
You need help?

494
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:25,798
I mean, I'm free.

495
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,867
Oh, um...

496
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,438
Oh, I'm-I'm good,
thanks. I'm, um...

497
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:33,906
I'm okay. I'm gonna...
I'm gonna take Charlotte.

498
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:37,877
I'm sensing some tension here.

499
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,679
Really?

500
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:41,681
I'm not.

501
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,616
I haven't forgotten about your
request for a personal day.

502
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,452
Things have been crazy here.
I just haven't had a chance

503
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:47,554
to look at the schedule yet.
Yeah. No. All good.

504
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:48,888
I haven't been thinking
about that.

505
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,323
I-I'm actually gonna
take Charlotte

506
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:51,924
'cause she's perfect for this.

507
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,361
Keep me posted.

508
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:55,662
Mm-hmm.

509
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,698
You needed me, Detective?

510
00:19:58,731 --> 00:19:59,799
Sure do.

511
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:01,434
Let's go.

512
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:03,470
("Cold Blood" by Valen playing)

513
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,007
(tires screech)

514
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,911
* Cold, cold blood

515
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:16,316
*

516
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:21,721
* Cold, cold blood

517
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:26,759
* No light when all the dust
has settled *

518
00:20:26,793 --> 00:20:29,028
* No life at all will ever...

519
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:32,465
Oh, Sinnerman!

520
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:34,000
Where are you?

521
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:37,470
* The dust has settled

522
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:40,573
The slaughterhouse vibe
is a little try-hard,

523
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:41,841
don't you think?

524
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:45,044
*

525
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,480
You know,
it's quite the party foul

526
00:20:47,514 --> 00:20:49,616
when the host
doesn't even show up!

527
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:51,618
SINNERMAN:
In here.

528
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:57,290
Ah, so what is it,
hide-and-seek now?

529
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:02,562
* Cold, cold blood

530
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:05,832
Come on, let's talk.

531
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:09,369
That is, if you're
man enough to face me!

532
00:21:09,402 --> 00:21:12,472
* Cold, cold blood.

533
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:19,679
SINNERMAN:
I do love a captive audience.

534
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:28,521
Oh.

535
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:31,691
Well played.

536
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:39,466
It's a pleasure
to finally meet you.

537
00:21:39,499 --> 00:21:41,067
Likewise.

538
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,770
Always gratifying to find out
that one's nemesis

539
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,838
is altogether lacking
in style.

540
00:21:45,872 --> 00:21:47,073
Never been much
of a dresser.

541
00:21:47,106 --> 00:21:49,108
I express myself
through my work.

542
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:52,412
I take it you're referring
to Frieda and Joey.

543
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:54,581
Why harm them
when you wanted me?

544
00:21:54,614 --> 00:21:58,585
Well, you can't have a trap
without bait,

545
00:21:58,618 --> 00:22:01,020
can you, now?

546
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:05,091
I hate to toot my own horn,
but I got you good.

547
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:06,559
Yes, indeed you did.

548
00:22:06,593 --> 00:22:08,695
Quite the mousetrap
you've laid out for me.

549
00:22:08,728 --> 00:22:10,963
And, unfortunately for you,

550
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:12,465
I'm no mouse.

551
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:15,902
(Sinnerman laughing)

552
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:18,004
And, unfortunately for you,

553
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:21,708
that's a foot
of reinforced steel.

554
00:22:21,741 --> 00:22:23,610
Takes a little extra

555
00:22:23,643 --> 00:22:25,011
to hold the Devil.

556
00:22:25,044 --> 00:22:28,448
Who are you?

557
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:31,618
How did you return my wings
and steal my face?

558
00:22:31,651 --> 00:22:33,085
Hmm.

559
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:34,854
You're just chock-full

560
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:36,022
of questions, aren't you?

561
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:38,625
Questions I'll answer
in time,

562
00:22:38,658 --> 00:22:40,727
'cause you should have
plenty of that.

563
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,531
This place has been abandoned
for at least ten years.

564
00:22:44,564 --> 00:22:47,534
Maybe they'll knock it down
with you still in it.

565
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:52,472
I tell you what, why don't you
take your sunglasses off, hmm?

566
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:55,508
Then we can have
a proper conversation.

567
00:22:57,176 --> 00:23:00,813
Want to do your little
desire shtick?

568
00:23:00,847 --> 00:23:03,483
Let me save us both
some time.

569
00:23:03,516 --> 00:23:08,521
I like redheads, strawberries,
and long walks on the beach.

570
00:23:09,756 --> 00:23:12,191
I've got work to do,
now that you're all checked in.

571
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,994
I don't have time
for parlor tricks.

572
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:17,730
Right.

573
00:23:17,764 --> 00:23:19,832
You hide behind your glasses,

574
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:22,068
but know this--

575
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:24,504
when I find out what someone
truly desires,

576
00:23:24,537 --> 00:23:26,806
I find out their
greatest weakness.

577
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:30,076
And that's not a parlor trick,
Sinnerman.

578
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:31,511
It's power.

579
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:32,912
Hmm.

580
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:34,213
And I promise you

581
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:37,817
I will find out
what you really want,

582
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:40,052
and when I do,

583
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:42,655
I'm going to use it
to destroy you.

584
00:23:42,689 --> 00:23:45,492
Yeah.

585
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:49,996
I'm right here, pal.
(chuckles)

586
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:51,498
What do you got?

587
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,601
Too slow.

588
00:23:54,634 --> 00:23:56,536
Why?!

589
00:23:58,237 --> 00:23:59,672
Why are you doing this?

590
00:23:59,706 --> 00:24:02,041
You'll see.

591
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:03,175
No!

592
00:24:04,844 --> 00:24:06,546
CHLOE: (sighs)
The reason I asked you

593
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:08,147
to come along is 'cause
you know Frankie.

594
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,982
I really need you
to work that connection.

595
00:24:10,016 --> 00:24:11,250
He won't know what hit him.

596
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:14,253
Wait. Can you
stick to the script

597
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:17,023
and say exactly what
I told you to say?

598
00:24:17,056 --> 00:24:18,925
Well, of course.
I'm not an idiot.

599
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,459
Let's go.

600
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:28,701
Last time we talked,
you wished there was a way

601
00:24:28,735 --> 00:24:30,136
that you could help
with Joey's death.

602
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:31,871
Well, there is.

603
00:24:31,904 --> 00:24:33,673
Our prime suspect is

604
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:36,843
a criminal who calls himself
the Sinnerman.

605
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:42,715
* Yes, there she is

606
00:24:42,749 --> 00:24:43,816
Doesn't ring a bell.

607
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,117
CHARLOTTE:
Frankie,

608
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:47,119
you know that you
and your people

609
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:48,721
are not under
investigation here.

610
00:24:48,755 --> 00:24:50,189
We just want a way
to find this guy.

611
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:54,761
The Sinnerman is known
to have entrepreneurial ties.

612
00:24:54,794 --> 00:24:56,529
Did you ever
cross paths with him?

613
00:24:56,563 --> 00:24:59,031
Well, Louie here crosses paths
with the Cinnabon once a week.

614
00:24:59,065 --> 00:25:00,900
Can't get enough of 'em.
Am I right, Louie?

615
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:02,602
(laughs): Yeah.

616
00:25:02,635 --> 00:25:05,972
If you help us out, I promise
it'll be worth your while.

617
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,306
Charlotte, we can't do that.
Look,

618
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:10,042
Frankie, come on, handy
for an entrepreneur like you

619
00:25:10,076 --> 00:25:11,611
to have friends
in the DA's office.

620
00:25:12,945 --> 00:25:14,647
* A romance we have...

621
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:15,548
Sorry, ladies.

622
00:25:15,582 --> 00:25:17,249
Wish I could help.
Cut the crap, Frankie.

623
00:25:17,283 --> 00:25:19,118
Give us something.
Charlotte...

624
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:22,021
Thank you, Mr. Ferrante,
for your time.

625
00:25:22,054 --> 00:25:23,055
* It remains a mystery

626
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:24,090
Good evening, gentlemen.

627
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:25,558
Good night, ladies.

628
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,162
* Right there she is...

629
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:32,131
I'm sorry,
Detective Decker.

630
00:25:32,164 --> 00:25:34,166
I know I went off
script a bit,

631
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,669
but I wanted to get
you what you needed.

632
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:37,670
And I didn't.

633
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:38,971
Charlotte,
are you kidding me?

634
00:25:39,005 --> 00:25:40,573
You were perfect.

635
00:25:40,607 --> 00:25:43,142
Frankie had to make sure that
we weren't coming after him,

636
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:45,344
and coming from you,
he believed it.

637
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,680
Mobsters like that--
they don't talk to the cops.

638
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:49,215
Then what was the point of that?

639
00:25:49,248 --> 00:25:51,818
How does this get us any closer
to the Sinnerman?

640
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:53,152
Frankie obviously
cares about Joey.

641
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:54,687
He's gonna want to get revenge.

642
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:56,956
I think he's gonna find
the Sinnerman on his own.

643
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:58,991
And when he does...

644
00:25:59,025 --> 00:26:00,593
you'll be waiting.

645
00:26:01,861 --> 00:26:04,931
You expected me
to fail, didn't you?

646
00:26:04,964 --> 00:26:07,867
Why didn't you just
trust me with the truth?

647
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,301
Charlotte, you know
the things you've done.

648
00:26:09,335 --> 00:26:11,971
You know the reasons
I can't trust you.

649
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:15,675
Huh. I suppose... I do.

650
00:26:15,708 --> 00:26:16,909
And, look, I want to believe

651
00:26:16,943 --> 00:26:18,678
that this change of heart
is for real,

652
00:26:18,711 --> 00:26:22,114
but you're gonna have to
earn that trust back, okay?

653
00:26:22,148 --> 00:26:23,816
This is a good start, though.

654
00:26:25,985 --> 00:26:28,621
I got to stay here
and watch Frankie,

655
00:26:28,655 --> 00:26:31,958
but let me call you a car,
get you a ride home.

656
00:26:31,991 --> 00:26:33,726
I'll find my own way home.

657
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,994
Good night.

658
00:26:35,027 --> 00:26:37,596
Oh. Night.

659
00:26:38,898 --> 00:26:42,234
(phone vibrates)

660
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:43,836
(scoffs)

661
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:44,871
Hey, Pierce.

662
00:26:44,904 --> 00:26:47,006
PIERCE: You still working
that Ferrante angle?

663
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,641
Uh, yeah, I am.

664
00:26:48,675 --> 00:26:50,376
It's turned into a stakeout.
But why?

665
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:52,879
'Cause I brought food.

666
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,916
Mind if I join you?

667
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,823
Come on.

668
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:05,658
Oh...

669
00:27:05,692 --> 00:27:07,359
So this is
your diabolical plan?

670
00:27:07,393 --> 00:27:09,195
Is it? Hmm?

671
00:27:09,228 --> 00:27:11,197
To bore me to death?!

672
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,032
(sighs)

673
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:15,401
WOMAN:
Lucifer?

674
00:27:15,434 --> 00:27:18,270
Lucifer, I know
you're in here.

675
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:19,972
In here!

676
00:27:22,341 --> 00:27:24,310
(door creaks)

677
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:25,444
Maze!

678
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,380
Oh, you're a sight
for sore eyes.

679
00:27:28,414 --> 00:27:30,116
I didn't realize
you still kept tabs on me.

680
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:31,784
What are you
talking about?

681
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:34,286
I tracked you down because I
have a bone to pick with you.

682
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,789
What?
I asked you to talk.

683
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:40,226
And you blow me off
and hide in a freezer?

684
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:42,328
I thought we were
past all of this.

685
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:44,797
Oh, sure, yeah, thought
I'd just hang around in here

686
00:27:44,831 --> 00:27:47,399
like a frozen side of beef
just to avoid you. (laughs)

687
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:50,269
Hello! I was a prisoner!

688
00:27:50,302 --> 00:27:52,204
The Sinnerman had me
trapped here.

689
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:53,439
Uh...

690
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,207
Now would you please
just stand aside?

691
00:27:55,241 --> 00:27:56,943
I need to figure out
what he's up to,

692
00:27:56,976 --> 00:27:59,011
and I've already lost
enough time as it is.

693
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:00,279
Hang on. You were trapped?

694
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:02,882
Well, obviously!

695
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:07,987
Maze!

696
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,322
(banging on door)

697
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:12,091
Oh, for...

698
00:28:15,995 --> 00:28:18,865
LUCIFER: Maze! Come on, open up!
(banging on door)

699
00:28:18,898 --> 00:28:21,233
I've got places to go,
people to hurt!

700
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:24,837
Just think of someone else's
needs for a change!

701
00:28:24,871 --> 00:28:26,505
Can you hear?

702
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,075
You're going nowhere, Lucifer.

703
00:28:29,108 --> 00:28:33,379
You don't get out until you
listen to what I have to say,

704
00:28:33,412 --> 00:28:36,115
and act like you care.

705
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:37,817
(laughs)

706
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:40,252
(quietly):
Can't believe this.

707
00:28:40,286 --> 00:28:42,221
(sighs)

708
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:46,125
What's on your mind, Maze?

709
00:28:46,158 --> 00:28:50,229
Did you know that Linda
and Amenadiel are a thing?

710
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:53,232
Linda and Amenadiel
are doing what now?

711
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:55,367
How'd you know?
What makes you say that?

712
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:56,468
Well, I saw them

713
00:28:56,502 --> 00:28:58,170
in her office.

714
00:28:58,204 --> 00:29:00,539
"Talking."

715
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,408
They were clearly about to bone.

716
00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:04,376
Right, you do realize

717
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,847
that talking in her office
is literally Linda's job?

718
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,319
Interesting point.

719
00:29:13,352 --> 00:29:14,921
Hmm, isn't it?

720
00:29:14,954 --> 00:29:16,288
And, you know, so what

721
00:29:16,322 --> 00:29:18,958
if Amenadiel is playing doctor
with the doctor?

722
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:20,559
So our old flames
are having a fling.

723
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,194
I don't care.
Why should you?

724
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,332
Unless...

725
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:27,834
(laughs)

726
00:29:27,867 --> 00:29:30,236
Unless you're still hot
for angel?

727
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:31,437
No!
No?

728
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,939
No!
Ah.

729
00:29:32,972 --> 00:29:34,941
Well, I...
I mean, she's just...

730
00:29:34,974 --> 00:29:37,810
my best friend, and he's my ex.

731
00:29:37,844 --> 00:29:39,211
I don't like it.

732
00:29:39,245 --> 00:29:41,981
So, you don't want him,
but nobody else can have him.

733
00:29:42,014 --> 00:29:43,315
That's awfully greedy
of you, Maze.

734
00:29:43,349 --> 00:29:45,351
I've been gone
for too long, okay?

735
00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:48,554
I just need to know
what the hell is going on.

736
00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:51,357
And what would you do
if you knew?

737
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,926
Hmm?

738
00:29:56,395 --> 00:30:00,132
Look, you really want
my advice, Mazikeen?

739
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:03,970
Ask yourself
what you truly desire.

740
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:05,938
And be honest.
Otherwise, there's no point.

741
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:11,210
Maze?

742
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:13,245
Mazikeen?

743
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,247
You still there?

744
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,150
(door unlocks)

745
00:30:22,955 --> 00:30:24,123
Thanks, Lucifer.

746
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:26,458
Great talk.
Glad I could help. Got to go.

747
00:30:29,061 --> 00:30:30,997
PIERCE:
I wonder when Frankie's

748
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,865
gonna make his move.

749
00:30:32,899 --> 00:30:35,401
Soon. Bet they're reaching
out to their sources,

750
00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:37,436
probably calling the
Sinnerman right now.

751
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:39,371
(indistinct radio chatter)

752
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,943
All right.

753
00:30:43,976 --> 00:30:45,611
Out with it, Decker.

754
00:30:45,644 --> 00:30:47,346
I either have food
in my teeth,

755
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:49,481
or you have something
you want to say to me.

756
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:53,552
Why is this case
so important to you?

757
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:55,421
It's not.

758
00:30:55,454 --> 00:30:57,223
It's a high-priority case,
and...

759
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:00,326
I need to display leadership

760
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:02,394
to the suits downtown.
That's all.

761
00:31:02,428 --> 00:31:05,631
Really? Showing up out of
nowhere while I'm on a stakeout?

762
00:31:05,664 --> 00:31:07,199
You said it yourself.

763
00:31:07,233 --> 00:31:10,069
You and the Sinnerman
crossed paths in Chicago.

764
00:31:10,102 --> 00:31:11,203
This is personal,
isn't it?

765
00:31:11,237 --> 00:31:14,173
(indistinct radio chatter)

766
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,308
It is.

767
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:19,578
The Sinnerman killed my brother.

768
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:24,350
I'm sorry.

769
00:31:26,352 --> 00:31:29,488
I thought I could run away
from the pain of it.

770
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:31,557
From him.

771
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:34,326
Now I know that I can't anymore,

772
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:38,497
so I need to find him and
make him pay for what he did.

773
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:43,602
Do you know why
I asked for that personal day?

774
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:45,604
The anniversary of

775
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:47,606
my father's death is coming up.

776
00:31:49,075 --> 00:31:51,277
And, uh, he was killed on duty.

777
00:31:53,045 --> 00:31:55,147
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

778
00:31:55,181 --> 00:31:56,615
It was a long time ago.

779
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:58,951
But just a few months ago,

780
00:31:58,985 --> 00:32:01,087
we finally found
the guy who did it.

781
00:32:02,288 --> 00:32:05,124
And I had dreamed of
that moment for so long.

782
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:06,993
Also kind of dreaded it.

783
00:32:07,026 --> 00:32:10,129
I mean, he caused my
family so much pain.

784
00:32:10,162 --> 00:32:13,165
When I finally
found him, I...

785
00:32:13,199 --> 00:32:15,267
I didn't know
what I'd do.

786
00:32:15,301 --> 00:32:17,136
What did you do?

787
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:20,172
I did the right thing.

788
00:32:20,206 --> 00:32:22,174
I arrested him.

789
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:24,110
But it wasn't easy.

790
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:27,346
I get it.

791
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:31,183
I know why you don't talk
about this stuff.

792
00:32:31,217 --> 00:32:34,686
(exhales) I don't, either,
not even to Lucifer.

793
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,489
It's just too painful.

794
00:32:40,426 --> 00:32:42,428
Think about what
you really want.

795
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:47,433
Don't do anything
you're gonna regret.

796
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:49,568
(sighs)

797
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:52,304
I guess I have
to give you

798
00:32:52,338 --> 00:32:53,672
that personal day now.

799
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:55,341
(chuckles lightly)

800
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:58,310
Heads up, we got someone.

801
00:32:58,344 --> 00:33:00,412
He doesn't look
like a mobster.

802
00:33:00,446 --> 00:33:02,714
Maybe one of their sources.
Let's hang tight.

803
00:33:02,748 --> 00:33:04,116
Copy that.
(phone vibrates)

804
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,484
Lucifer.

805
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:06,518
Detective.

806
00:33:06,552 --> 00:33:08,554
Finally. Look,
I'm on a stakeout.

807
00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:10,122
You were right.

808
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:11,257
The Sinnerman
is behind this.

809
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,424
You don't say.

810
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:14,160
I've just gotten
out of cold storage

811
00:33:14,193 --> 00:33:15,327
after being grabbed
by him again.

812
00:33:15,361 --> 00:33:17,429
What? Are you okay?
LUCIFER: I'm fine.

813
00:33:17,463 --> 00:33:20,432
Just dying to crush that
pathetic excuse for a man.

814
00:33:20,466 --> 00:33:22,601
You saw him? What
does he look like?

815
00:33:22,634 --> 00:33:24,336
Black fellow, early 40s,

816
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:25,704
though he dresses
like an old man.

817
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,606
Would you believe
he wore a sweater vest?

818
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:29,141
His greatest crime yet.

819
00:33:29,175 --> 00:33:31,177
CHLOE: That's not a source;
that's him.

820
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:33,479
Let's go.

821
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,247
Wait, Detective.

822
00:33:35,281 --> 00:33:37,083
Detective?
(gunshots)

823
00:33:37,116 --> 00:33:39,051
(gunshots)

824
00:33:39,085 --> 00:33:41,187
Bloody hell.

825
00:33:47,493 --> 00:33:50,296
(Frankie groaning)

826
00:33:54,233 --> 00:33:56,535
Drop the weapon.
(gunshots)

827
00:33:59,105 --> 00:34:00,172
I'm on him! Cut him off!

828
00:34:00,206 --> 00:34:01,673
Chloe, wait!

829
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:08,380
(gunshot)

830
00:34:11,817 --> 00:34:13,785
(gunshot)

831
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:17,489
(gunshot)

832
00:34:17,523 --> 00:34:20,426
We've got units outside!

833
00:34:20,459 --> 00:34:23,095
If you give up now,
we can take you in safely.

834
00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:24,696
But this is so much fun.

835
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,432
(gunshots)

836
00:34:26,465 --> 00:34:29,635
(whispering):
Oh. Where are you?

837
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:32,304
Where are you?

838
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:37,676
(gunshot)

839
00:34:43,282 --> 00:34:45,384
(gunshot)

840
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,563
(panting)

841
00:35:00,366 --> 00:35:02,801
Do what you got to do.

842
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:05,404
Pierce, wait.

843
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:12,144
Hey.

844
00:35:12,178 --> 00:35:13,812
Let me help you.

845
00:35:18,184 --> 00:35:19,451
(groans)

846
00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:23,189
You already did.

847
00:35:23,222 --> 00:35:25,191
(grunts)

848
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:28,394
You're under arrest.

849
00:35:28,427 --> 00:35:30,462
Let's go.
(handcuffs tighten)

850
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:36,568
(indistinct police radio
chatter)

851
00:35:43,342 --> 00:35:45,777
(tires squeal, engine turns off)

852
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,381
Detective.

853
00:35:49,415 --> 00:35:52,351
You're okay. What happened?

854
00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:53,519
We got him.
What?

855
00:35:53,552 --> 00:35:55,554
You did it.
You got the Sinnerman.

856
00:35:55,587 --> 00:35:58,657
Actually, Pierce did.

857
00:35:59,925 --> 00:36:01,660
Right.

858
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:03,662
Right. Well,
where-where is he?

859
00:36:04,796 --> 00:36:06,465
He's, um...

860
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:07,799
(exhales)

861
00:36:09,701 --> 00:36:11,403
I want to talk to him.

862
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:14,840
Lucifer.

863
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:16,475
Don't worry.

864
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,244
You'll get your chance.

865
00:36:18,277 --> 00:36:19,811
Officer, he's ready.

866
00:36:39,431 --> 00:36:41,633
Linda, you there?

867
00:36:45,337 --> 00:36:46,572
What's up?

868
00:36:46,605 --> 00:36:48,707
Are you alone?

869
00:36:49,608 --> 00:36:51,377
Yeah. Why?

870
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:55,247
'Cause you're acting
kind of strange.

871
00:36:55,281 --> 00:36:56,715
What's going on?

872
00:36:58,817 --> 00:36:59,918
Uh...

873
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,722
I should have told
you this earlier,

874
00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:07,559
but it was... weird

875
00:37:07,593 --> 00:37:11,430
seeing you and Amenadiel so...
chummy.

876
00:37:11,463 --> 00:37:13,899
Oh. Were we?

877
00:37:13,932 --> 00:37:15,901
Yeah, you were.

878
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:18,404
Made me feel like beating
the crap out of him.

879
00:37:18,437 --> 00:37:21,273
Or at least
throwing rocks at cars.

880
00:37:21,307 --> 00:37:22,508
But, no, I didn't.

881
00:37:23,509 --> 00:37:25,411
I came to tell you how I feel.

882
00:37:25,444 --> 00:37:26,612
Yes.

883
00:37:26,645 --> 00:37:28,980
Please. Tell me.

884
00:37:30,516 --> 00:37:32,851
Okay. Um...

885
00:37:32,884 --> 00:37:36,755
I've been thinking
about it all day.

886
00:37:36,788 --> 00:37:39,391
You're my best friend, you know?

887
00:37:39,425 --> 00:37:41,427
And he's my ex.
(chuckles)

888
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,462
And by-by "ex," I mean, like,

889
00:37:43,495 --> 00:37:46,298
one of a million
ex-sexual partners

890
00:37:46,332 --> 00:37:49,735
and not anything special.

891
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:53,839
Any-Anyway, um...

892
00:37:53,872 --> 00:37:57,876
it makes me feel left out.

893
00:37:57,909 --> 00:38:01,079
So I don't want you two
getting together

894
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,048
if that's possible.

895
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:06,051
I understand.

896
00:38:07,886 --> 00:38:09,988
You have nothing to worry about.

897
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,958
Thank you.

898
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:16,795
(sighs) I figured you wouldn't
want my sloppy seconds, anyway.

899
00:38:16,828 --> 00:38:20,632
And you know me,
I was all over that angel.

900
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:21,933
I went in deep.

901
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:24,370
Used every tool

902
00:38:24,403 --> 00:38:26,037
in that Swiss Army knife.

903
00:38:26,071 --> 00:38:27,739
Know what I mean?

904
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:32,444
I touched nerves that he never
knew he had.

905
00:38:32,478 --> 00:38:34,613
I can only imagine.

906
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:36,382
(laughing):
Yeah.

907
00:38:36,415 --> 00:38:37,683
Anyway...

908
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:41,953
You're the best, Linda.

909
00:38:47,393 --> 00:38:49,528
(crying)

910
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:52,398
(door opens and closes)

911
00:38:52,431 --> 00:38:54,332
DAN:
You okay in there?

912
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:57,969
Um... (sniffles)

913
00:38:58,003 --> 00:38:59,838
I'm-I'm fine.

914
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:03,575
Thank you, Detective Espinoza.

915
00:39:03,609 --> 00:39:04,843
Charlotte?

916
00:39:04,876 --> 00:39:06,745
CHARLOTTE: I just needed
a moment. (sniffles)

917
00:39:06,778 --> 00:39:09,080
And I thought that this was...

918
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:12,551
the one place that
I wouldn't be disturbed.

919
00:39:12,584 --> 00:39:15,421
DAN:
I don't want to pry, but, uh,

920
00:39:15,454 --> 00:39:18,023
you don't seem fine.

921
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:19,558
(sniffling)

922
00:39:19,591 --> 00:39:22,661
(sighing):
I'm not.

923
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:24,830
I switched to prosecution

924
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:26,898
to try and be
a better person...

925
00:39:26,932 --> 00:39:28,967
but I'm not
helping anyone.

926
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,871
I just keep screwing
things up. (sniffles)

927
00:39:32,904 --> 00:39:37,108
I was really good
at being the old me.

928
00:39:37,142 --> 00:39:39,978
The best.

929
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:44,550
But I know I need
to make a change.

930
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:47,853
And I suck at it.

931
00:39:49,855 --> 00:39:53,024
No one expects you
to change overnight.

932
00:39:54,826 --> 00:39:58,464
It's hard to be one
of the good guys.

933
00:39:58,497 --> 00:40:00,466
Look, I screw up, too.

934
00:40:00,499 --> 00:40:03,869
I've made plenty of mistakes,
believe me.

935
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:07,172
But I don't quit...

936
00:40:07,205 --> 00:40:09,808
and I know that
counts for something.

937
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,779
At least you're trying, right?

938
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:22,120
(chuckles lightly)

939
00:40:26,191 --> 00:40:27,526
Thank you, Dan.

940
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:29,695
Don't mention it.

941
00:40:29,728 --> 00:40:31,830
(door opens)

942
00:40:33,532 --> 00:40:35,501
Oh, hey, Hernandez.

943
00:40:38,637 --> 00:40:40,606
I'm in the men's room,
aren't I?

944
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:41,773
Oh, yeah.

945
00:40:41,807 --> 00:40:44,009
(laughs)

946
00:40:47,713 --> 00:40:49,815
*

947
00:40:57,956 --> 00:41:01,793
* What happens in the shadows

948
00:41:01,827 --> 00:41:04,830
* No one has to know

949
00:41:04,863 --> 00:41:06,998
* The truth is in the gallows

950
00:41:09,535 --> 00:41:12,804
* It'll burn
but it won't let go *

951
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:15,741
* A whisper in the darkness

952
00:41:15,774 --> 00:41:18,710
* In the quiet it'll grow

953
00:41:18,744 --> 00:41:19,911
* You try to hide it

954
00:41:19,945 --> 00:41:22,914
* In the farthest place

955
00:41:22,948 --> 00:41:27,485
* But everybody knows

956
00:41:29,087 --> 00:41:33,559
* There's something
in the shadows *

957
00:41:33,592 --> 00:41:36,928
* Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

958
00:41:36,962 --> 00:41:40,866
* Cuts you like an arrow

959
00:41:40,899 --> 00:41:43,935
* Shifting through the dark

960
00:41:43,969 --> 00:41:48,707
* Your strength is in
your weakness *

961
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:52,043
* This fire in your blood

962
00:41:52,077 --> 00:41:55,313
* Hanging from that hope

963
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:58,016
* But everybody knows

964
00:41:58,049 --> 00:42:00,185
* There's something
in the shadows *

965
00:42:02,153 --> 00:42:03,822
My, my...

966
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:06,625
how the tables have turned.

967
00:42:06,658 --> 00:42:10,829
I don't know if you remember,
but I made you a promise:

968
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:13,098
to look into your eyes
and find out

969
00:42:13,131 --> 00:42:16,334
what the great Sinnerman
desires...

970
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,069
and then take it from him.

971
00:42:19,638 --> 00:42:21,607
* There's something
in the shadows *

972
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,275
I'm a man of my word,
so let's get to it, shall we?

973
00:42:25,944 --> 00:42:28,079
Look at me.

974
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:32,884
Look into my eyes!

975
00:42:32,918 --> 00:42:36,822
* There's something
in the shadows *

976
00:42:36,855 --> 00:42:39,991
* Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

977
00:42:40,025 --> 00:42:42,928
* Cuts you like an arrow

978
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:47,899
* Shifting through the dark

979
00:42:47,933 --> 00:42:50,669
Now...

980
00:42:50,702 --> 00:42:53,605
you'll never know what I want.

981
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:55,106
But...

982
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:57,275
* Hanging from that hope

983
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:59,177
Call Chloe!

984
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:00,345
Chloe!

985
00:43:00,378 --> 00:43:01,346
Tell Chloe!

986
00:43:01,379 --> 00:43:04,349
Somebody get a
medic in here!

987
00:43:04,382 --> 00:43:06,251
(laughs)
