1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,471
Previously, on Lucifer...

2
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:04,738
Someone is forcing
those wings on me.

3
00:00:04,772 --> 00:00:06,574
I'm sure it's all a part
of God's plan.

4
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:08,042
If you mean His plan
to continually

5
00:00:08,076 --> 00:00:10,144
manipulate and control
me, then agreed.

6
00:00:10,178 --> 00:00:12,746
I really appreciate how
you handled the whole

7
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,149
"me not wanting you and
Amenadiel to bone" thing.

8
00:00:15,183 --> 00:00:18,018
I do really like you.

9
00:00:19,087 --> 00:00:21,255
You can't die, I know.
But I promise you,

10
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:22,756
I will find a way to end

11
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:26,094
your infinite misery
if it's the last thing I do.

12
00:00:26,127 --> 00:00:28,629
Thank you for your help, mate.

13
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:30,598
No worries.
This actually gives me time

14
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:33,234
to brainstorm a little problem
of my own.

15
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:34,535
Aah!

16
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:36,637
LUCIFER: I don't understand.
How does this not work?

17
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,072
You still have no idea
how to kill me.

18
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:45,646
Lucifer, I'm here.

19
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:48,649
Are you ready?

20
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:51,152
Lucifer?

21
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:57,158
(laughs):
Why is it so dark in here?

22
00:00:57,191 --> 00:00:58,559
Wha...?

23
00:01:00,828 --> 00:01:02,163
Lucifer?

24
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:07,101
Lucifer?
(sighs)

25
00:01:07,135 --> 00:01:08,269
LUCIFER:
Detective.

26
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:10,271
(gasps)

27
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:12,273
There's been a change of plan.
I'm not going.

28
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:14,542
What? But we have a case.

29
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:17,211
Something's happened.
Please leave.

30
00:01:17,245 --> 00:01:19,613
Wait, what's happened?
Are you okay?

31
00:01:19,647 --> 00:01:21,149
LUCIFER:
I can't...

32
00:01:21,182 --> 00:01:24,118
I can't make them go away.

33
00:01:24,152 --> 00:01:26,154
Wha...?

34
00:01:26,187 --> 00:01:26,920
Lucifer,

35
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:30,224
what's on your back?
Detective,

36
00:01:30,258 --> 00:01:32,693
I said leave!

37
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:35,163
(gasping)
What's going on?

38
00:01:35,196 --> 00:01:37,798
I can't...

39
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:40,801
I can't control them.

40
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:42,236
(screams)

41
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,306
No! Detective!

42
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:47,208
(gasping)

43
00:01:48,276 --> 00:01:50,611
Detective!

44
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:52,680
Detective, grab my hand!

45
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:55,183
Detective!

46
00:01:55,216 --> 00:01:56,150
(Chloe screams)

47
00:01:56,184 --> 00:01:58,152
No!

48
00:01:58,186 --> 00:02:00,154
No...

49
00:02:00,188 --> 00:02:02,290
No!

50
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:04,592
And then I woke up.

51
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,261
And it's not the sort
of dream I'm used to.

52
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:08,896
A lot less nudity.

53
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:10,264
So what do you think
it means?

54
00:02:10,298 --> 00:02:11,632
Well, I think it's
pretty obvious

55
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:12,900
what it means, Lucifer.

56
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:16,270
That I need sturdier
guardrails?

57
00:02:16,304 --> 00:02:18,339
Or, maybe there's some
symbolism in there.

58
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:20,341
You mean my wings, don't you?
Yes.

59
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:21,342
Well, clearly, you have issues.

60
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,611
Well, you would, too,
if your father slapped

61
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,646
a pair on your back.

62
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:28,616
Took away your Devil face,
took away who you are.

63
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:32,353
I mean, who knows what else
He'll take from me.

64
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:35,356
Lux? My...
job with the LAPD?

65
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:36,890
Or Chloe.

66
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,796
Well, she may be part of it,
but this isn't about her.

67
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:43,997
This is about me.

68
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:47,368
So can we please just focus
on what truly matters here?

69
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:49,337
Which is?
Showing my Father

70
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,205
that He can't control me.

71
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:53,374
And He's not as powerful
as he thinks.

72
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:54,908
And how are you going
to do that?

73
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:56,777
By defying Him.

74
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,979
I'm gonna remove
Pierce's immortal curse

75
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,214
so he can finally die.

76
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:04,985
There's just
one problem, though.

77
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:05,919
Just one?

78
00:03:05,953 --> 00:03:08,222
(sighs) Everything
that I've come up with,

79
00:03:08,256 --> 00:03:10,291
Pierce has already tried.

80
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:12,260
I'm completely out of ideas.

81
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:15,963
My well is dry,
and that is why I'm here.

82
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:17,064
Yeah, well.

83
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:20,334
Not sure I know how to remove
an immortal's curse.

84
00:03:20,368 --> 00:03:21,402
(laughs):
No.

85
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:24,338
I need you to remove
my mental block.

86
00:03:24,372 --> 00:03:26,407
Hypnotize me, or something.

87
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,809
I hear it works with smoking
and insomnia, so...

88
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:30,344
(grunts)

89
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:32,846
Unfortunately, that's not
how it works, Lucifer.

90
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,816
There's no easy fix
for a lack of ideas.

91
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,385
No?

92
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:38,752
No.

93
00:03:38,786 --> 00:03:39,853
You just have
to be patient.

94
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:43,824
You never know when or where
inspiration will strike.

95
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:46,294
Well, thank you,
Doctor.

96
00:03:46,327 --> 00:03:49,330
For being completely
unhelpful today.

97
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:52,266
(scoffs)

98
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,702
(sighs)

99
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,737
(phone rings)

100
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,444
Ah.

101
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:05,846
Hi, Amenadiel.

102
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,348
*

103
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:09,350
* Ooh, ooh

104
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:12,052
* Ooh.

105
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,321
Hey, Ella?

106
00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:14,888
Um...
(clears throat)

107
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:17,325
Uh, listen, about tonight?

108
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:18,992
I'm gonna have to...
No!

109
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:20,794
No.

110
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:23,331
You better not
be cancelling on me again.

111
00:04:23,364 --> 00:04:25,333
I know,
I'm so sorry.

112
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:27,368
It's just,
I have so much work to do.

113
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:28,302
Can't you play hooky?

114
00:04:28,336 --> 00:04:29,737
Not if I want to be

115
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,339
a responsible adult.

116
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:32,340
Right.

117
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:33,941
But...

118
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:35,876
What if...

119
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:38,546
you weren a responsible adult?

120
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,783
(laughing):
Just this once.

121
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:44,818
Come on!

122
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:45,919
Chloe,

123
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:48,456
I mean, don't you ever miss
just having stupid fun

124
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:49,923
like when you were a kid?

125
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:53,327
I was a pretty grown-up kid,
actually.

126
00:04:53,361 --> 00:04:57,030
Well, never too late to start.

127
00:04:57,064 --> 00:05:00,434
I know.
I'm sorry, babe, I can't.

128
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:03,070
Can we do a neon party
rain check?

129
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:07,775
Decker, one of these days,

130
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,810
you're gonna realize
what you've been missing.

131
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:11,945
(quietly): It looked
so cute on you.

132
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,481
(scoffs)

133
00:05:16,384 --> 00:05:18,386
(indistinct radio chatter)

134
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,463
This is the longest you've
ever gone without talking.

135
00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:32,032
Ever. Is something
on your mind?

136
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:33,534
Nothing.

137
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,935
That's the problem.
(sighs)

138
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:36,504
Uh, how so?

139
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:38,439
(sighs) Well, I...

140
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:41,542
I have this puzzle
that I need to solve,

141
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:42,976
but I've hit a mental block.

142
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,244
Okay.
Have you ever just

143
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:47,948
ran out of ideas when working
a particularly difficult case?

144
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:49,850
I mean, before I came along,
of course.

145
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:51,519
(scoffs) Right.

146
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:54,488
Um... not really.

147
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:56,424
I-I mean, I've hit dead ends

148
00:05:56,457 --> 00:05:58,426
from lack of evidence,

149
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:01,094
but no, because there's always
a new angle to consider.

150
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:03,564
Braggart.

151
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:05,966
(sighs)

152
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:11,004
DAN: Our victim's name was
Kathleen Pike, 33.

153
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,506
She's the author
of a best-selling

154
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,408
futuristic Y.A. series

155
00:06:14,442 --> 00:06:16,510
called Class of 3001.

156
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:18,111
She was found
with her head bashed in

157
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:19,980
by her own
vintage typewriter.

158
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:21,181
The irony's a little
on the nose.

159
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,616
Or on the head, should I say?

160
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,485
CHLOE:
What's that white stuff?

161
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:26,053
ELLA: I know what you
guys are thinking.

162
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:27,621
She's a synthetic.

163
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:32,460
Aliens. The android
who bled white. (gurgles)

164
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:37,531
No one? Really?
Oh, never mind.

165
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:39,533
That's melted ice cream, anyway.

166
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:41,502
It looks like our victim was
about to dig in last night

167
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:44,004
when someone showed up
and rewrote her dessert menu

168
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:45,606
with that typewriter.

169
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:48,542
Real wound's
over here though.

170
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:51,479
Huh. Who found the body?
(camera clicks)

171
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:52,946
Kathleen's editor.
Vincent Green.

172
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,081
He's out by the pool.

173
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:56,484
Thank you.

174
00:06:56,517 --> 00:06:58,151
Uh, Daniel.

175
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:01,154
Your head is mostly empty.
Huh?

176
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:03,624
Exactly. And yet, you manage
to do this improv thing.

177
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:05,593
How do you come up with stuff
on the spot like that?

178
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:08,896
Well, the first rule of improv
is "yes, and..."

179
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,631
Yes and what?

180
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:13,066
That's the name
of the technique.

181
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,067
Right. I've heard you talk
about it before,

182
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,103
but I don't actually understand
what it means.

183
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:20,040
Well, you agree with whatever's
being said-- yes.

184
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:22,676
And then you say the first thing
that comes to your mind-- and.

185
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,178
That makes no sense.

186
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:27,180
(sighs) But I'm desperate,
so I'll try anything.

187
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:28,448
Yes, and.

188
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:30,951
VINCENT: I got the call
from Kathleen late last night.

189
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:32,653
She finally finished
the new book.

190
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:34,187
We made plans for me
to come over this morning,

191
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:35,188
pick up the manuscript.

192
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:37,525
Do you usually pick up
manuscripts in person?

193
00:07:37,558 --> 00:07:39,192
With Kathleen, yes.

194
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:40,661
There's only ever
one hard copy

195
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:42,696
since she does all her writing
on that typewriter.

196
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,498
Yes, and... well, her dying

197
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:46,099
on that typewriter as well,
it seems.

198
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,935
CHLOE: Do you know anyone who
would have done this to her?

199
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:51,171
Any known enemies?
No, Kathleen was
extremely well-liked.

200
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:53,206
She had millions
of devoted fans.

201
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,709
Ugh, I know how fans can get
obsessed with their idols.

202
00:07:55,743 --> 00:07:57,645
Yes, and... with their boobs.

203
00:07:57,678 --> 00:07:59,947
Like after you did
Hot Tub High School, Detective.

204
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,650
Oh. Uh-huh.
You don't think this could
be my fault, do you?

205
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:05,085
Why?
I was so excited
that she was finished

206
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:06,587
that I tweeted the news
to her fans.

207
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,657
I really talked the book up,
hinting at this huge

208
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,692
action-packed robot rebellion
ending she teased me with.

209
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:13,627
Well, as long as you didn't
tweet her address as well.

210
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:15,696
No, of course not,
but someone could find that.

211
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:17,230
Someone who wanted to
read the book first?

212
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:19,700
Yes, and... someone who wanted
to tell her

213
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:22,035
that robot rebellions couldn't
be more dull and derivative.

214
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:23,637
What is with all this
"yes, and" stuff?

215
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:25,573
Oh, just some improv thing
I was hoping

216
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:27,307
would knock me out
of my idea dry spell.

217
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,610
But you're literally just saying
what you would normally say,

218
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:31,645
with the words "yes, and"
in front of it.

219
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:34,147
Yes, and...
it's clearly not working.

220
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,983
Uh-uh.
Stupid Daniel.

221
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,317
Idea dry spell.

222
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,586
Just like Kathleen.

223
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:39,720
What do you mean?

224
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:42,255
She had the worst case of
writer's block I've ever seen.

225
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:45,025
Took her five years to figure
out how to end the series.

226
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:47,595
Well, never mind that.
How did she cure her block?

227
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:50,263
I don't know, she said I would
understand after I read it.

228
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:52,332
Said she even explained
how she broke through it

229
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,634
in the book's afterword.

230
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:55,068
But you haven't read it.

231
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:56,269
No, like I said,
there's only one copy

232
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:57,605
and I haven't seen it.

233
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:59,072
Detective.

234
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:00,674
This afterword
could explain how

235
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,576
to overcome my own form
of writer's block.

236
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,744
What?

237
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:04,812
We need to find it.

238
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:07,280
The killer. You mean we need
to find the killer.

239
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:09,282
Exactly. So they can
hand over that book.

240
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:10,651
Uh-huh.

241
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:12,686
*

242
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:23,196
* Never get to bed...

243
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,033
Mmm. Linda, I have to say,

244
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:29,870
these last few weeks have been
absolutely incredible.

245
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,772
Wow.

246
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:34,207
You're really good at this
sweet, sappy stuff, aren't you?

247
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,109
(chuckles)
(giggles)

248
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:39,747
I feel the same.

249
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,915
Good.

250
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:44,117
Well, maybe someday

251
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:46,019
we can actually have
this date in public?

252
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:50,223
(both laugh)

253
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:51,324
(sighs)

254
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:54,895
I do hate sneaking around,
but Maze.

255
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,765
I know. I know.
She can't find out.

256
00:09:57,798 --> 00:10:00,200
I...

257
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:02,770
I want to tell her,
I just don't know how.

258
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:06,039
I admit, I'm afraid.

259
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:08,241
Well, you should be.
Maze would...

260
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,811
not take this well.

261
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:12,846
I feel so guilty, I.... (scoffs)

262
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,848
I've been avoiding
her calls.

263
00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:16,049
Are we being cowards?

264
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,785
Yes.

265
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:18,952
But, Linda, it's...

266
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:21,121
Maze.
Maze. I know.

267
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:22,790
Do you know how she's doing?

268
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:24,792
I'm sure she's fine.

269
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:27,394
Busy hunting bounties and all.

270
00:10:28,896 --> 00:10:32,099
But...

271
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:35,135
I can check on her if that'll
make you feel better.

272
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:37,871
Really? Just to make sure
she's okay.

273
00:10:37,905 --> 00:10:40,140
Of course.

274
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:41,942
I would do anything for you.

275
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,144
* Over my head...

276
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:46,146
What? Is that too sappy?

277
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:49,382
* No, I don't like my fate

278
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:53,386
* Or how I'm turning out

279
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,155
* Yeah

280
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:57,224
* How I'm turning out.

281
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:59,292
"Max was plagued with confusion.

282
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:02,730
"If Jessica truly loved him,
then why'd she kiss Tristan?

283
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:07,167
"And in the back seat
of her flying car, no less."

284
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,837
This has sold
millions of copies.

285
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,405
Tongueless kissing and stealing
liquor from their parents.

286
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:15,876
(chuckles) I mean,
where's the sex? The drugs?

287
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:18,879
That robot rebellion
cannot come soon enough.

288
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:22,115
Was your high school experience
this pathetically PG?

289
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:24,818
I didn't have much of
a high school experience.

290
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:26,787
Oh! Played hooky
a lot did you?

291
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,021
Suddenly I like you more.

292
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:30,357
No, child actors don't have
much time for regular school.

293
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,860
You're either
auditioning or on set,

294
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:35,863
so it's mostly tutors.
Ah.

295
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:38,165
Maybe I did
miss out on a lot.

296
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,867
Anyhow, why are you
reading those?

297
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,202
I doubt that that's gonna
lead us to Kathleen's killer.

298
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:43,871
Oh, well, Kathleen's
afterword explained

299
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:44,838
how she overcame
her writer's block.

300
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:47,140
In order to understand,
I may need context.

301
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:48,942
Oh, in case she uses examples?

302
00:11:48,976 --> 00:11:51,845
Exactly.
So, speaking of the killer,

303
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,346
any leads?

304
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,982
Yeah, actually.

305
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:56,917
Someone who goes by
the name of

306
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,452
"Ashley3001fan."

307
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:03,056
Got into some pretty heated
online arguments with Kathleen.

308
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,357
Apparently,
she wasn't too happy

309
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,293
the book was taking
so long to be completed.

310
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:08,829
Poor Kathleen. When will people
understand writer's block

311
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:10,230
is a very serious condition?

312
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:11,431
Well, Kathleen agreed.

313
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:14,201
LUCIFER: "I don't have to answer
to ignorant trolls like you.

314
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,904
"There's a reason I'm the
writer and you're a fan.

315
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:17,737
"Maybe you should try

316
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:19,206
contributing something
to society."

317
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,941
Ouch, nicely put, Kathleen.

318
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:23,143
Yeah. After Kathleen
publicly berated her,

319
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:24,912
Ashley went completely offline.

320
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:27,247
You think Ashley
was so humiliated by her hero

321
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,348
that she wanted revenge?

322
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:30,217
(sighs)
It's possible.

323
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,020
Well, let's hope so 'cause
I need to find that boo...

324
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:35,288
Killer, the b-- killer.

325
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:37,958
I know you mean book.

326
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:39,126
I did.

327
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:41,428
(knocking on door)

328
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:45,132
Hi, Amenadiel.

329
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:48,268
Hey, Trixie.
Uh, is Maze here?

330
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:50,270
Sorry, no.

331
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,305
Oh.

332
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,278
Would you mind telling her
that I stopped by, please?

333
00:12:58,311 --> 00:12:59,947
Sure.

334
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,015
Thanks.

335
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,523
Nice work, Trix.

336
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:12,860
Why don't you
want to see him?

337
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:14,061
Amenadiel's nice.

338
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:16,296
Nice?

339
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,298
If he were nice,

340
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:21,234
he wouldn't be sneaking around
behind my back with my friend,

341
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:23,937
and lying about it.

342
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:25,138
Why are they
doing that?

343
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:27,174
I don't know.
'Cause they suck.

344
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:29,142
Mommy says that sometimes,

345
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:32,012
people are just scared
to tell the truth.

346
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:33,981
Maybe they need a little help.

347
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:36,283
That's not a bad idea, kid.

348
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:41,488
Helping people tell the truth
is kind of my thing.

349
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:45,825
Huh.

350
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,998
I cybertraced
Ashley3001fan to here.

351
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:52,299
And the ice cream
from the crime scene,

352
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,934
also from here.

353
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:56,036
Ashley could be
one of these three.
Yes.

354
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:58,205
They do seem like
the insipid Y.A. type.

355
00:13:58,238 --> 00:14:00,941
Though, scooping frozen treats
for others day in, day out,

356
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:02,442
seems even more boring.

357
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:04,044
CHLOE: Yeah, but they get to
hang out with their friends.

358
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:05,545
There's no
adult responsibility.

359
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,247
It looks like
they're having fun.

360
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,949
You know, stupid fun.

361
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:10,984
Since when do you
like "stupid fun"?

362
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:13,420
Hi.

363
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:16,856
Detective Decker, LAPD.
I'd like to ask you all some...

364
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,961
Freeze.
LUCIFER: Ha.

365
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:22,362
"Freeze,"
good one.

366
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:24,965
(panting) Please.

367
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:26,199
Please don't call my mom.

368
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:27,334
I-It's just one joint.

369
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:30,370
Claire?
What's going on?

370
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:32,372
Claire?

371
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:34,441
You're not Ashley?

372
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:35,943
No, I'm Ashley.

373
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:38,078
Ashley's a man?

374
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:39,179
Yeah, I'm a man.

375
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,982
And I'm the manager.
What's going on?

376
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:43,350
Oh, what's
going on, Ashley,

377
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,052
is you need to
give me that book.

378
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:46,553
Otherwise, I'll show you
the true meaning of

379
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:48,255
"you scream for ice cream."

380
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:50,257
Okay?

381
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,891
All right.

382
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:00,934
LUCIFER: I'm gonna
ask you nicely, Ashley.

383
00:15:00,968 --> 00:15:01,935
Where's the book?

384
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:05,438
Dude, I'm telling you.
I don't have any book.

385
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:11,044
Then why was that found
at Kathleen Pike's home?

386
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,514
"3000 and Yum."

387
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:18,351
Yeah, that's a flavor I created
special for Kathleen.

388
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:20,087
I brought it to her house
personally.

389
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,089
Do you always bring ice cream
to your murder victims?

390
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:25,325
Murder?

391
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:27,160
Wait...

392
00:15:27,194 --> 00:15:28,528
Kathleen's dead?

393
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:30,097
Very.

394
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,465
Man, she was the greatest writer
of our generation.

395
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:33,366
What?

396
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,402
Her books were about
high school drama.

397
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:38,305
What could a man of your age
possibly find great about them?

398
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:41,041
(chuckles): I mean, high school
was the best time of my life.

399
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:45,145
Reading 3001 makes me
feel like I'm 16 again.

400
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:47,447
Those books are deeper
than you think.

401
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,150
We know about your online fight
with Kathleen.

402
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:52,185
Things got very heated.

403
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:54,321
Must've hurt to have her
insult you like that

404
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:55,588
in front of everybody.

405
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,024
I never should've
said those things.

406
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:58,558
So, I sent her
some of my writing.

407
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:00,193
You know, like an olive branch.

408
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:02,129
Hold on, you're a writer?

409
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:03,030
Yeah, man.
I've written, like,

410
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:05,598
tons of Class of 3001
fan fiction.

411
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:09,136
Can't imagine that Kathleen
was too pleased.

412
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:11,171
Kathleen liked my writing.

413
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:13,373
She even asked me to help her
finish her last book.

414
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:15,342
She asked you to help?

415
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:18,211
So Kathleen's solution to
writer's block was to outsource?

416
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:20,480
Yeah, but when Kathleen
read my version,

417
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:23,483
she decided she wanted to go
in a different direction.

418
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:26,586
But she said it did help her
f-finish her book on her own.

419
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:28,355
So... (scoffs) boom.

420
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:30,423
It did? How?

421
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:33,193
What exactly helped Kathleen
overcome her block?

422
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:35,362
She told me she realized

423
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:38,231
she needed to be more authentic.

424
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:40,633
You know, get back
to her original inspiration.

425
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:44,071
That is completely meaningless.

426
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:47,640
Well, well, what was
the original inspiration?

427
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:51,511
Oh? You guys don't know?

428
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:54,081
So, the characters in Kathleen's
books are based on real people.

429
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:55,582
DAN: And all of her
stories were taken

430
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:57,050
from her real life
at Westside High,

431
00:16:57,084 --> 00:16:58,185
right here in L.A.

432
00:16:58,218 --> 00:17:01,221
LUCIFER:
Max, Jessica, Isabel.

433
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:03,090
She didn't even change
any of the first names.

434
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:05,492
Did she have any
original ideas at all?

435
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:06,659
Well, she changed
the last names.

436
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,261
ELLA: And she did
have to come up

437
00:17:08,295 --> 00:17:09,629
with all that
futuristic sci-fi stuff.

438
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:11,598
I mean, trust me,
that is not easy.

439
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:13,266
I'm actually writing
my own book

440
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,534
about a forensic
scientist

441
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:16,403
who talks to ghosts.
You are? Tell me,

442
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:18,138
what do you do when
you run out of ideas?

443
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:20,373
Oh, I never run out of ideas.
I've got way too many.

444
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:21,641
My problem is how to choose.

445
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:23,276
Well, there's no need
to rub it in.

446
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,178
Thank you.
So, this author exposed

447
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:26,546
all these people's
dirty laundry?

448
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:27,614
Sounds like motive to me.

449
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:31,651
Uh, I think Charlotte...
uh, Ms. Richards is right.

450
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:33,686
If, uh, someone saw
the editor's tweet

451
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,223
announcing another book, then
maybe one of them killed her

452
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:37,590
to make sure it
didn't come out.

453
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:40,127
Ella.

454
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,696
The main characters
from the Class of 3001--

455
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,566
if the book's gonna reveal
any secrets, it's theirs.

456
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:48,101
These are our suspects.

457
00:17:48,135 --> 00:17:51,738
Right. Prom king,
sexpot, cheerleader,

458
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:54,807
bad boy, valedictorian, jock.

459
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:57,444
One of these six degenerates has
my book. Let's bring them in.

460
00:17:57,477 --> 00:18:00,447
No, all you have is speculation.
Not enough for arrest warrants.

461
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,482
I mean, even if we did
bring them all in,

462
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:03,716
we don't have any leverage.

463
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,285
Why would they
admit to anything?

464
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:06,386
CHLOE: Well, according
to superfan Ashley,

465
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,321
Kathleen was rushing to get
her book done in time

466
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:09,589
to announce it
at her high school reunion,

467
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:10,590
which is tomorrow night.

468
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:13,360
Well, if all our suspects
are in town to attend,

469
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:15,262
gave them opportunity.

470
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:17,164
Mm-hmm. And it gives us
an opportunity as well,

471
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:18,165
to go undercover.

472
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:20,733
Well, good. What are we
waiting for?
Well,

473
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,602
it's a high school reunion.
Everybody knows everybody.

474
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:26,306
Unless...
you're Todd Cornwell.

475
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:27,207
Who's Todd Cornwell?

476
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,742
Exactly. Todd Cornwell.

477
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,544
Class loner, acne,

478
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:32,745
Coke-bottle glasses,
whole bit.

479
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,347
Went to college overseas,

480
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:36,783
and when I stalked Kathleen's
classmates online,

481
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:39,752
Todd was the only one with
zero social media presence.

482
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:42,422
Lucifer, you could go as Todd.

483
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:46,493
Yeah, no, no, seriously.
Look, he looks just like you.

484
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:47,494
LUCIFER:
Has all that masturbation

485
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:49,296
finally caught up with
your eyesight, Daniel?

486
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:50,863
No one'll believe that
even if I tell them

487
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:52,599
I've had a face
and body transplant.

488
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,501
CHLOE: Yeah, but it
might be our only shot.

489
00:18:54,534 --> 00:18:55,602
I mean, I could go
as your plus-one.

490
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,237
ELLA:
Oh, poops. Hold up.

491
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,539
Todd RSVP'd "yes."

492
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:02,642
(sighs) Charlotte,
is there any legal way

493
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:03,776
to prevent him from attending?

494
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:07,747
Well, it's definitely
not legal

495
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,217
to distract Todd with,
say, a bounty hunter.

496
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,519
If anyone needs me,
I'm gonna be in my office

497
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:13,653
not hearing the plan.

498
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:15,688
Okay, great.
Are you gonna call Maze?

499
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:19,492
Gladly, whilst you
research our suspects.

500
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:21,428
Enjoy.

501
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:23,730
Maze.

502
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:26,799
I'm so glad you're here.

503
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,902
Yeah, well,
you seem pretty busy.

504
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:32,539
I called a couple of times.
Never heard back.

505
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:35,808
Yeah, I know, work's been crazy.

506
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:40,280
Oh. I was hoping that maybe
you found a boyfriend.

507
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:41,381
Boyfriend?
Yeah.

508
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:44,517
Why would I... (laughs)

509
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:45,918
Definitely no boyfriend.

510
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:47,654
Really?
Yup.

511
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:51,258
So single. So... so single.

512
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,593
Well, in that case,
I should totally set you up.

513
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:54,894
I have just the guy.

514
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:57,530
Oh, that it so thoughtful
of you, Maze,

515
00:19:57,564 --> 00:19:59,699
but you really don't
have to do that.

516
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:03,670
Please, Linda, I want to.
What are best friends for?

517
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,572
I know, it's just me
and blind dates...

518
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:07,274
How about tomorrow night?
Tomorrow night?

519
00:20:07,307 --> 00:20:08,408
Mm.

520
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:11,678
Oh... shoot. I think I'm busy.

521
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,582
Let me do this.

522
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:18,217
Tomorrow it is.

523
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:30,430
(gasps)

524
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:32,665
No.

525
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:34,467
(sighs)

526
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:36,569
(exclaims)
BEATRICE: Mom?

527
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,839
Baby, what are you doing up?
Get back in bed.

528
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:41,708
Bed? It's morning.

529
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:43,843
I'm gonna miss the bus.

530
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:45,412
What?

531
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:46,012
I've-I've, uh...

532
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:48,281
I've been up all night?

533
00:20:48,315 --> 00:20:50,317
Come on, come on.
Get the...

534
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:53,853
Get-get, go, get your...
Where's the...?

535
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:57,624
* Tell me, did you fall
from a shooting star? *

536
00:20:57,657 --> 00:20:59,792
* One without a permanent scar

537
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:01,761
* And did you miss me

538
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:03,830
* While you were looking
for yourself out there? *

539
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:07,600
(gasps) Oh.

540
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:09,436
Wow.

541
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:11,904
You know, high school reunion's
a very popular torture in Hell.

542
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:13,973
CHLOE:
This is beautiful.

543
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:17,009
I... you know, you didn't
even try to look like Todd.

544
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:18,845
(clears throat)
Well... well, why
would I do that?

545
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:20,647
If I was Todd, I'd
want to look like me.

546
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,649
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh, look.

547
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:24,016
It's Emily and Bo,

548
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,485
Tristan and Jessica,

549
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:27,354
and there's Max talking
to Isabel.

550
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:29,522
She is so not
good enough for him, really.

551
00:21:29,556 --> 00:21:31,658
(laughs)
What did you just say?

552
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:32,992
(clears throat)

553
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,662
Max and Isabel,
two of our suspects.

554
00:21:35,695 --> 00:21:36,696
Oh, oh!

555
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:39,532
The prom king
and the sexpot.

556
00:21:39,566 --> 00:21:40,933
Oh, Lucifer, don't judge.

557
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,669
They're so much more
to these people

558
00:21:42,702 --> 00:21:44,036
than their stereotypes suggest.

559
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,505
(laughs):
Right.

560
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:46,406
It's just, ugh.

561
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:47,707
Are you being serious?

562
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,642
Yeah. Yeah, the books
are much deeper

563
00:21:49,676 --> 00:21:50,910
than you'd imagine.

564
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:54,681
The characters, they're so
compelling and relatable

565
00:21:54,714 --> 00:21:56,816
and rich, and I-I mean...
(stammers)

566
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:58,385
They're all here.

567
00:21:58,418 --> 00:21:59,986
And one of them
is most likely a killer.

568
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:01,688
Right.

569
00:22:01,721 --> 00:22:02,955
Right.
Right.

570
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:04,491
Okay, I'm gonna go
sign us in

571
00:22:04,524 --> 00:22:06,693
so that we can
finally meet the, um...

572
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:09,829
so we can
question the suspects.

573
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:11,063
(giggles)

574
00:22:11,097 --> 00:22:12,999
What is happening?

575
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:20,440
Okay, so we each have
three people to question.

576
00:22:20,473 --> 00:22:21,908
Let's figure out
who was worried about

577
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:23,510
Kathleen's book coming out.

578
00:22:23,543 --> 00:22:25,412
Yes, and where everyone was
the night of the murder.

579
00:22:25,445 --> 00:22:26,913
Oh, yeah.

580
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:28,381
Are you even listening to me?

581
00:22:28,415 --> 00:22:29,682
Mm-hmm.

582
00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:31,784
Do you know, I can't believe
I'm saying this,

583
00:22:31,818 --> 00:22:32,885
but focus, Detective.

584
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:34,020
I need that afterword.

585
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:35,688
Right, sorry.
Right.

586
00:22:35,722 --> 00:22:36,889
Oh, my God.
What?

587
00:22:36,923 --> 00:22:38,725
It's Jessica.

588
00:22:38,758 --> 00:22:39,759
Can you believe

589
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:41,861
that sophomore year,
she hooked up with Tristan

590
00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:44,063
on the laserball field?

591
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:45,432
(exhales sharply)

592
00:22:45,465 --> 00:22:48,468
Don't worry,
Jessica's on my list.

593
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,671
Okay, so,
I'm the first one here.

594
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:53,806
I'll just go have a drink
at the bar.

595
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,408
HOSTESS:
Sure thing.
Linda.

596
00:22:56,976 --> 00:22:58,711
Amenadiel,
what are you doing here?

597
00:22:58,745 --> 00:23:00,413
Well, Maze invited me.

598
00:23:00,447 --> 00:23:02,682
I thought she wanted to talk
after I stopped by yesterday.

599
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:05,818
Maze is setting me up
on a blind date.

600
00:23:05,852 --> 00:23:07,587
What if you are my blind date?

601
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,088
Well, that doesn't make
any sense.

602
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:11,424
Unless she knows about us
and is trying to make us squirm.

603
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:13,893
And torture
is her thing.

604
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:15,428
MAZE:
Linda,

605
00:23:15,462 --> 00:23:17,430
this is Todd.

606
00:23:17,464 --> 00:23:19,832
Your date.

607
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:21,468
Hello.

608
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:23,135
This is a blue lobelia.

609
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:26,005
Native Americans used them
to treat constipation.

610
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:29,576
Thank you.

611
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:30,810
(sighs)

612
00:23:30,843 --> 00:23:32,111
(grunts)

613
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:35,147
But what are you two doing here?

614
00:23:36,182 --> 00:23:37,416
Double date.

615
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:40,119
Isn't this great?

616
00:23:41,521 --> 00:23:43,089
Hmm.

617
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:44,824
Yeah, uh, no...

618
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:46,926
Hi.

619
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:49,462
That's great.

620
00:23:49,496 --> 00:23:51,964
("Let Me Blow Ya Mind"
by Eve playing)

621
00:23:51,998 --> 00:23:55,535
(both talking quietly)

622
00:23:55,568 --> 00:23:57,504
Excuse us. Isabel.

623
00:23:59,806 --> 00:24:00,907
Todd?

624
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,509
Odd-bod Todd?

625
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:03,476
Are...

626
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,945
I'm sorry. You...

627
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:08,047
just look so different.

628
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,482
I'll take that as a compliment.

629
00:24:09,516 --> 00:24:11,017
Wow, I...

630
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,485
Do you have a British accent?

631
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:14,220
Well, I've had many accents
over the years,

632
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:15,888
but this one is clearly
the best.

633
00:24:15,922 --> 00:24:17,223
(laughs)

634
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:20,960
You're so funny and... so hot.

635
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:22,962
(chuckles)
I know.
Mmm.

636
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:25,832
Uh, but I need
to ask you a few questions.

637
00:24:25,865 --> 00:24:27,867
Sure. Let's catch up.

638
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,537
Can you believe Kathleen's
coming out with another book?

639
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:32,004
Oh, I believe it.

640
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:34,907
That bitch loved
profiting off of us.

641
00:24:34,941 --> 00:24:36,643
Ugh, she sucks.

642
00:24:36,676 --> 00:24:39,912
But honestly, we're all, uh,
just trying to move on.

643
00:24:39,946 --> 00:24:42,081
Man, those books ruined
our lives.

644
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:43,783
I had to move to Maine.

645
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,151
Do you know
what was in her last book?

646
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:46,819
What sparked her final idea?

647
00:24:48,054 --> 00:24:49,656
The books
are about you, correct?

648
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:51,958
* And I ain't goin' nowhere...

649
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,192
Oh, for...
CHLOE: So, do you know

650
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:54,360
what happens in the new book?

651
00:24:54,393 --> 00:24:57,163
Are there any big secrets
that come out or... (gasps)

652
00:24:57,196 --> 00:24:59,532
Does Isabel actually
get pregnant?

653
00:24:59,566 --> 00:25:01,568
Uh, who are you again?

654
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:02,802
What were you doing
two nights ago?

655
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:04,671
I was... at home?

656
00:25:04,704 --> 00:25:05,972
Doing a facial.

657
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,206
I was with Tristan.

658
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:09,709
I think.

659
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:11,544
I mean, by the time I flew in,
it was really late.

660
00:25:11,578 --> 00:25:13,112
You're hiding something.

661
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:14,647
And I think I know what.

662
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:16,583
It's because
you were with Bo,

663
00:25:16,616 --> 00:25:18,084
and you didn't want Isabel
to find out.

664
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:19,852
But, like, who cares
what Isabel thinks?

665
00:25:19,886 --> 00:25:22,689
Especially after what she did
to you in chemistry class?

666
00:25:22,722 --> 00:25:25,057
I mean, do you realize you're
still lucky to have your hand?

667
00:25:25,091 --> 00:25:26,926
ISABEL: It doesn't matter
where I was two nights ago.

668
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:30,997
What matters is that tonight,
we're together.

669
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,665
(sighs)

670
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:34,567
So where were you
two nights ago?

671
00:25:34,601 --> 00:25:36,068
* That's hard to find...

672
00:25:36,102 --> 00:25:37,937
Let's go talk somewhere
a little quieter.

673
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,606
Right.

674
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:41,307
Yeah, talk. Uh-huh.

675
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,110
(laughing)

676
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:46,579
You two have so
much in common.

677
00:25:46,613 --> 00:25:48,114
Yeah.

678
00:25:48,147 --> 00:25:49,582
Linda, you're a therapist.

679
00:25:49,616 --> 00:25:50,917
And, Todd,

680
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,652
you're in therapy.

681
00:25:52,685 --> 00:25:53,886
Discuss.

682
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,588
Oh.

683
00:25:55,622 --> 00:25:57,223
You don't have to...
I wet the bed.

684
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:02,228
It's more common
than people think.

685
00:26:02,261 --> 00:26:03,896
You're lovely.

686
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:06,098
I'm so glad she convinced me
to skip my reunion for this.

687
00:26:06,132 --> 00:26:07,233
(laughs awkwardly)

688
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:09,602
Most serial killers wet the bed.

689
00:26:09,636 --> 00:26:10,469
(hisses)

690
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:14,607
I smell a love
connection, don't you?

691
00:26:14,641 --> 00:26:16,909
Let's crank this
date up a notch.

692
00:26:16,943 --> 00:26:18,077
Waiter.

693
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,279
(quietly):
Linda.

694
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:21,380
This is getting out of control.

695
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,916
We just have to get through
tonight. We can do it.

696
00:26:25,652 --> 00:26:27,754
(Maze sighs)

697
00:26:27,787 --> 00:26:28,921
So, Todd.

698
00:26:29,989 --> 00:26:31,624
Any hobbies?

699
00:26:31,658 --> 00:26:33,760
I make my own toothpaste.

700
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,130
Where were you two nights ago?

701
00:26:38,164 --> 00:26:39,966
Uh...

702
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:41,067
Come on, Tristan.

703
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,635
I can't remember.

704
00:26:42,669 --> 00:26:44,370
Well, try.

705
00:26:44,403 --> 00:26:45,271
(chuckles nervously)
I told you, man,

706
00:26:45,304 --> 00:26:47,073
I don't, I don't remember
where I was.

707
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,207
Oh!

708
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,643
Tell me the truth now.

709
00:26:50,677 --> 00:26:52,679
Okay.
A couple nights ago,

710
00:26:52,712 --> 00:26:54,213
we all broke into
the school pool.

711
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:56,983
You know, just a little party
before the party, you know?

712
00:26:57,016 --> 00:26:58,184
Well, why is that a secret?

713
00:26:58,217 --> 00:27:00,653
Because we didn't
invite everyone.

714
00:27:00,687 --> 00:27:02,254
Well, you, for instance.

715
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:04,657
What?
I'm sorry, man.

716
00:27:04,691 --> 00:27:06,158
If we knew how cool
you had gotten,

717
00:27:06,192 --> 00:27:07,794
we totally would've
invited you.

718
00:27:07,827 --> 00:27:10,763
So what you're saying is
you all have the same alibi?

719
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:13,065
(groans)

720
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:14,767
Wasting our time here.

721
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:15,768
(pants)

722
00:27:15,802 --> 00:27:18,237
Where's the detective?

723
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,139
MAX:
I dig you, Chloe.

724
00:27:20,172 --> 00:27:22,274
You...
you're different.

725
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:24,844
Too bad you didn't go
to high school with us.

726
00:27:24,877 --> 00:27:26,278
Yeah.

727
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:27,747
That would have been great.

728
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,749
Yeah.

729
00:27:29,782 --> 00:27:33,953
So, you were gonna tell me

730
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:35,688
where you were two nights ago?

731
00:27:35,722 --> 00:27:37,256
(chuckles)

732
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:40,727
Is that really what you want
to talk about, hmm?

733
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,796
Well, I mean,

734
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:46,833
I would really like to know.

735
00:27:46,866 --> 00:27:48,968
JESSICA:
Max!

736
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,803
What are you doing? Who is that?

737
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:52,338
Uh...
We were talking.

738
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:53,973
And what do you care?

739
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,709
You cheated on Max
with Tristan.

740
00:27:56,743 --> 00:27:58,711
That was 15 years ago.

741
00:27:58,745 --> 00:28:00,980
MAX: Actually, I am still
kind of pissed...
Right.

742
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,982
...about that.
I'm sorry
I cheated on you,

743
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:05,117
but I only did it because
I thought you slept with Emily.

744
00:28:05,151 --> 00:28:07,119
I would never
cheat on you, Jessica.

745
00:28:07,153 --> 00:28:09,255
I know that now.

746
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:10,857
I read 3001.

747
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,759
It showed me how much
you really loved me.

748
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:13,993
Hmm.

749
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:15,427
JESSICA: You know,
sometimes I think about

750
00:28:15,461 --> 00:28:17,129
getting back together.

751
00:28:17,163 --> 00:28:18,230
CHLOE:
Mmm.

752
00:28:18,264 --> 00:28:19,265
Me, too.

753
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:20,432
Oh.

754
00:28:20,466 --> 00:28:22,034
EMILY: What's
going on here?

755
00:28:22,068 --> 00:28:24,003
Max, I thought it
was gonna be just us.

756
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:26,272
I'm not really down
for a four-way.

757
00:28:26,305 --> 00:28:28,007
LUCIFER:
Make that five.

758
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,142
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I'm not down, either.

759
00:28:31,844 --> 00:28:33,780
Oh. So you were sleeping
with Emily...
Oh.

760
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:36,415
...weren't you? And then you
bring this rando in here, too?

761
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:37,750
I'm not a "rando."
I-I just met

762
00:28:37,784 --> 00:28:38,818
this rando.
JESSICA: We are never...

763
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:40,286
Hey.
...getting back together.

764
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,387
You didn't tell her about us?
MAX: Jessica, I--

765
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,755
this rando...
Us?
Yes, us.

766
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:43,722
That's what you said.
MAX: I never said...

767
00:28:43,756 --> 00:28:45,758
Oh, really, Max?
...anything like that to you.

768
00:28:45,792 --> 00:28:48,527
Detective! None of these people
killed Kathleen.

769
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,429
What?
"Killed"?

770
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:51,530
EMILY: What?
"Detective"?

771
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,299
LUCIFER: I have discovered
that they all

772
00:28:53,332 --> 00:28:54,533
have the same alibi.

773
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,202
They broke onto
the campus two nights ago

774
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:57,369
and had a party
by the pool.

775
00:28:57,403 --> 00:28:58,805
Didn't you? Hmm?

776
00:28:58,838 --> 00:29:01,307
So, Kathleen's killer, not here.

777
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,775
Look at me,
being the responsible one.

778
00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:06,045
So that's why you were
all acting so strangely.

779
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,780
MAX:
Yeah.

780
00:29:07,814 --> 00:29:09,281
Sorry we didn't invite
you, Todd, but, uh...

781
00:29:09,315 --> 00:29:10,216
you're not mad, right?

782
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,918
You were hanging out
with Kathleen anyway.

783
00:29:11,951 --> 00:29:12,952
CHLOE:
What?

784
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:14,553
Todd was hanging out

785
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,122
with Kathleen two nights ago?

786
00:29:16,155 --> 00:29:18,057
Yeah, it's what he said
in the e-mail.

787
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,959
I did? I...

788
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:22,328
What? He was an
awesome math tutor,

789
00:29:22,361 --> 00:29:23,830
and now he helps me
with my taxes.

790
00:29:23,863 --> 00:29:25,064
LUCIFER:
Detective.

791
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,132
I think I'm the killer.

792
00:29:31,971 --> 00:29:34,240
(siren wailing)

793
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:38,344
Apparently, Maze took Todd
to a steakhouse in Hollywood.

794
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:40,847
It is an odd place
for a kidnapping, even for Maze.

795
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,815
And what motive would Todd have
to kill Kathleen?

796
00:29:42,849 --> 00:29:44,216
He's not even in the books.

797
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,284
Well, exactly.

798
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:47,887
Odd-bod Todd's probably tired
of being left out.

799
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,889
Oh, right, should have
thought of that.

800
00:29:49,922 --> 00:29:51,557
Yes, you should have,

801
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,826
but someone was making the case
all about themselves.

802
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,863
Slightly unprofessional,
but I forgive you, Detective.

803
00:29:56,896 --> 00:29:58,998
I know. I can't believe
I let myself

804
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:00,499
get so wrapped up
in all of that.

805
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:01,767
Think I was just trying
to make up

806
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,404
for all the fun, teenage drama
that I missed out on, you know?

807
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:07,506
I didn't even get to go
to my own prom.

808
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:09,942
It's ridiculous, I know.

809
00:30:09,976 --> 00:30:11,978
No, it's not.

810
00:30:12,945 --> 00:30:15,014
(engine revs)

811
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:18,584
And that's the best way
to clean out an abscessed tooth.

812
00:30:18,617 --> 00:30:20,987
How delightful.

813
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,989
I am so glad we did this.

814
00:30:23,022 --> 00:30:24,957
I have missed you guys.

815
00:30:24,991 --> 00:30:25,691
(chuckles)

816
00:30:25,724 --> 00:30:27,927
I mean...
(inhales sharply)

817
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,462
(sighs) what's not
to miss, right?

818
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:34,300
Mmm.

819
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:36,302
Mmm.
Okay, stop.

820
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:37,870
Uh,
that's inappropriate.

821
00:30:37,904 --> 00:30:39,005
(quietly):
We're in a restaurant, Maze.

822
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:40,272
Who cares?

823
00:30:40,306 --> 00:30:42,008
I care. I mean, I'm just...

824
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:44,410
it ju-- it just makes me
uncomfortable.

825
00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:46,412
Oh, it does?

826
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:48,447
Well, does this make you
uncomfortable, too?

827
00:30:49,916 --> 00:30:50,749
AMENADIEL:
(groans) Maze!

828
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:53,019
Maze! Why are you
acting like this?

829
00:30:53,052 --> 00:30:55,955
Because she knows.

830
00:30:55,988 --> 00:30:58,024
You know, don't you?

831
00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:01,460
And you're torturing us.

832
00:31:02,995 --> 00:31:04,463
That is so incredibly mean.

833
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:05,932
I'm the one who's mean?

834
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:09,435
You're the ones who've been
running around,

835
00:31:09,468 --> 00:31:12,304
lying to me about this fling
for weeks.

836
00:31:12,338 --> 00:31:14,006
LINDA: Of course we lied, Maze.
Look at you.

837
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,641
You have a tendency
to overreact.

838
00:31:15,674 --> 00:31:17,343
I do not...

839
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:18,677
overreact.
AMENADIEL: Maze.

840
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,346
Can we just calm down here?
No!

841
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,348
No.

842
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:26,352
I will not take orders from
some pathetic daddy's boy.

843
00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:30,022
Tell me,
Amenadiel.

844
00:31:30,056 --> 00:31:32,992
Is this the divine purpose
your Father sent you here for?

845
00:31:33,025 --> 00:31:34,927
So you can bang

846
00:31:34,961 --> 00:31:38,464
some... selfish human?

847
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:40,399
Selfish? Selfish?

848
00:31:40,432 --> 00:31:44,103
All I do
is listen to your problems!

849
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:46,038
Everyone's problems!

850
00:31:46,072 --> 00:31:49,008
So, yeah, for once,
I put myself first

851
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:51,410
and did what makes me happy.

852
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:53,679
So, sue me. Or torture me.
Or better yet,

853
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:56,082
why don't you just skewer me
with one of your knives?

854
00:31:56,115 --> 00:31:58,350
But before you do,

855
00:31:58,384 --> 00:32:01,620
know that this wasn't
some fling,

856
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,990
that what Amenadiel
and I found

857
00:32:04,023 --> 00:32:07,493
was completely unexpected,

858
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:11,397
but 100% real.

859
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:14,433
(inhales sharply)

860
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:16,135
But you were my friend.

861
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:26,112
Maze?

862
00:32:26,145 --> 00:32:29,048
LAPD, drop
the weapons.

863
00:32:35,421 --> 00:32:39,058
Yes, I indeed visited Kathleen
two nights ago.

864
00:32:39,091 --> 00:32:40,659
The night she was murdered.

865
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:43,162
Kathleen was murdered?

866
00:32:43,195 --> 00:32:45,631
Oh, my.

867
00:32:46,665 --> 00:32:50,169
And y-you think I did it.

868
00:32:52,738 --> 00:32:55,141
(sighs)
Of course you do.

869
00:32:55,174 --> 00:32:57,009
The weirdo.

870
00:32:57,043 --> 00:32:59,011
The outcast.

871
00:32:59,045 --> 00:33:02,014
(sighs) I'm used to people
judging this book by its cover.

872
00:33:02,048 --> 00:33:04,050
That's why I swore off
social media.

873
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:07,519
I still don't even know
how Kathleen tracked me down.

874
00:33:07,553 --> 00:33:09,088
Kathleen tracked you down?

875
00:33:09,121 --> 00:33:11,090
She wanted to discuss

876
00:33:11,123 --> 00:33:13,125
the final installment
of her series with me.

877
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:14,660
Well, why would she talk
about that with you?

878
00:33:14,693 --> 00:33:15,694
You're not even
in the books.

879
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:18,030
Yeah. I was surprised, too.

880
00:33:18,064 --> 00:33:21,200
Turns out, not only was
she going to include me

881
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:22,568
in the final book,

882
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:24,703
she was making me the hero.

883
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,039
Wait, h-hold on, does that mean
she let you read the book?

884
00:33:27,073 --> 00:33:29,041
Uh, no.

885
00:33:29,075 --> 00:33:30,576
She didn't want me
to read it yet.

886
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:32,711
Kathleen was waiting
for the reunion.

887
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:35,147
She was excited
about finishing it in time

888
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:36,115
to show everyone there.

889
00:33:36,148 --> 00:33:38,817
So you have no idea
what's in the afterword?

890
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,053
The afterword? No.

891
00:33:41,087 --> 00:33:44,590
But she did tell me
about the story itself.

892
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:46,592
How it had

893
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:48,827
a peaceful, grounded ending.

894
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,464
No scandals,
no insiders versus outcasts.

895
00:33:52,498 --> 00:33:54,466
Just...

896
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,069
people finally understanding
each other.

897
00:33:57,103 --> 00:33:59,671
The way
she described it, it...

898
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:01,073
(sighs)

899
00:34:01,107 --> 00:34:03,475
...it sounded beautiful.

900
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:05,144
And boring.
And not at all like

901
00:34:05,177 --> 00:34:06,745
the action-packed robot ending

902
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:08,247
that the editor told us about.

903
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,082
I smell a new theory brewing.

904
00:34:10,116 --> 00:34:11,150
I got to go make a phone call.

905
00:34:11,183 --> 00:34:13,485
Mr. Green.

906
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:16,222
Hi, uh,
Detective Decker, LAPD.

907
00:34:16,255 --> 00:34:17,423
Detective, how can I help you?

908
00:34:17,456 --> 00:34:20,759
Um, I was just wondering,
did Kathleen ever talk to you

909
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:23,095
about working
with a ghostwriter?

910
00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:25,797
A ghostwriter? No, wish she had.

911
00:34:25,831 --> 00:34:27,533
Maybe she would have finished
the book sooner.

912
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:29,268
Oh, I see.

913
00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:33,172
So-so, she never mentioned
a-a fan-fic writer

914
00:34:33,205 --> 00:34:34,773
named Ashley Collins?

915
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:37,143
He's a-a manager
at an ice cream shop.

916
00:34:37,176 --> 00:34:39,178
I think the name's
Scoop Science.

917
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:40,846
Actually, yeah,
Kathleen did mention some sort

918
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,515
of overeager fan who invented
some special flavor for her.

919
00:34:43,549 --> 00:34:45,151
Kind of creeped her out.

920
00:34:45,184 --> 00:34:46,652
Wh-Why are you asking?

921
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:48,520
Is this Ashley a suspect?

922
00:34:48,554 --> 00:34:51,190
Oh, well, I can't divulge any of
that information at this time.

923
00:34:51,223 --> 00:34:53,792
But you've been
incredibly helpful, Mr. Green.

924
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:55,894
Thank you.

925
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,264
You in the mood
for some ice cream?

926
00:35:15,581 --> 00:35:17,249
Hello, Vincent.

927
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,289
Looking for Ashley?
Sorry to disappoint.

928
00:35:23,322 --> 00:35:24,823
What are you doing here?
CHLOE: Drop the gun.

929
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:28,260
You're under arrest
for the murder of Kathleen Pike.

930
00:35:28,294 --> 00:35:29,728
You lied to us, Vincent.

931
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:31,563
I called Ashley.
He confirmed

932
00:35:31,597 --> 00:35:34,166
that the robot ending was
his version and not Kathleen's.

933
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,335
Th-That means nothing.
But it is suspicious.

934
00:35:36,368 --> 00:35:37,703
So I looked at traffic footage.

935
00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:39,771
You went to Kathleen's house
the night of the murder.

936
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:42,274
But, Detective, didn't
he tell us he didn't go

937
00:35:42,308 --> 00:35:43,709
over there
till the next morning?

938
00:35:43,742 --> 00:35:46,745
Fine. Yes,
I was at Kathleen's that night.

939
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:49,381
If you had waited five years
for that damn book like I did,

940
00:35:49,415 --> 00:35:52,218
you wouldn't want to wait
another second for it either.

941
00:35:52,251 --> 00:35:53,752
But once you got it,
you didn't like what you read,

942
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:55,621
did you?
I was horrified.

943
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:58,357
She ended the series
in the most boring way possible.

944
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,491
And you were worried
about the sales.

945
00:35:59,525 --> 00:36:01,360
We'd lose millions

946
00:36:01,393 --> 00:36:03,362
without the right ending.
Ashley's.

947
00:36:03,395 --> 00:36:05,631
So you and Kathleen argued
over which one to use.

948
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,633
She refused to use
the good version.

949
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:11,337
So, yeah, I threw
her stupid typewriter at her.

950
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:12,738
But even with Kathleen gone,
you knew

951
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:15,341
that you couldn't publish
Ashley's ending as hers.

952
00:36:15,374 --> 00:36:17,709
So you came here
to tie up the one loose end.

953
00:36:17,743 --> 00:36:19,645
Now, tell me, Vincent--

954
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:21,780
Kathleen's manuscript,

955
00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:22,848
where is it?

956
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:23,849
I don't have it.

957
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:25,217
I destroyed it.

958
00:36:25,251 --> 00:36:26,418
You did what?

959
00:36:26,452 --> 00:36:29,788
I couldn't let anybody read
that pathetic joke of an ending!

960
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:31,323
But I needed to read
the afterword

961
00:36:31,357 --> 00:36:32,458
so I could fix my problem,

962
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:34,260
and now you're saying
it's gone?!
CHLOE: Lucifer,

963
00:36:34,293 --> 00:36:35,361
back off.

964
00:36:35,394 --> 00:36:36,428
What did it say?

965
00:36:36,462 --> 00:36:37,763
The afterword?
Yes!

966
00:36:37,796 --> 00:36:39,865
How did she fix her block?

967
00:36:39,898 --> 00:36:41,833
I don't know!
She said inspiration came

968
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:43,469
when she realized
she couldn't go back

969
00:36:43,502 --> 00:36:44,636
and change what she'd done.

970
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,338
Well, that doesn't
help me at all!

971
00:36:46,372 --> 00:36:47,273
Lucifer, stop!

972
00:36:47,306 --> 00:36:49,341
Now I'm never gonna
figure out how to...

973
00:36:57,383 --> 00:36:59,418
(handcuffs tighten)
Are you okay?

974
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:01,253
No, Detective.

975
00:37:01,287 --> 00:37:03,689
Far from it.

976
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:08,727
("Bad Love" by RY X playing)

977
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:19,605
Remind me to never go on
another blind date ever again.

978
00:37:19,638 --> 00:37:22,341
Mm-mm. Oh, I don't know,

979
00:37:22,374 --> 00:37:25,311
I thought you and Todd
really made a connection.

980
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:27,379
(chuckles softly)

981
00:37:27,413 --> 00:37:29,415
Okay, so I've been thinking.

982
00:37:29,448 --> 00:37:31,417
Yeah.
A lot.

983
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:33,419
* Tie you up, not enough...

984
00:37:33,452 --> 00:37:35,687
Pretty crazy what Maze did.

985
00:37:35,721 --> 00:37:37,856
I'll say.

986
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:39,525
But she was right.

987
00:37:40,892 --> 00:37:43,462
We never should have lied
to her.

988
00:37:43,495 --> 00:37:45,964
And I never should have lied
to myself.

989
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:47,899
Yourself?

990
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:49,768
What do you mean?

991
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:53,772
As much as I tried
to tell myself otherwise,

992
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:56,875
I knew what we were doing
was going to hurt her.

993
00:37:56,908 --> 00:37:59,345
And I did it anyway.

994
00:37:59,378 --> 00:38:01,880
That's how much I wanted
to be with you, Amenadiel.

995
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,418
Look, you've made me happier
than I've been

996
00:38:06,452 --> 00:38:08,787
in a long, long time.

997
00:38:10,456 --> 00:38:12,424
But...

998
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:13,859
I was being selfish.

999
00:38:13,892 --> 00:38:15,527
Maze is my friend.

1000
00:38:17,896 --> 00:38:19,731
* I'll be your warmth here...

1001
00:38:19,765 --> 00:38:21,467
(sighs)

1002
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,502
I can't be with you anymore.

1003
00:38:23,535 --> 00:38:25,604
* I'll be your back...

1004
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:27,506
Not when it does this to her.

1005
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,443
* I put you in the corner...

1006
00:38:31,477 --> 00:38:33,779
You know, it's not fair for her
to take this away from us.

1007
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:36,848
I know. I don't expect you
to understand.

1008
00:38:36,882 --> 00:38:38,484
* Please, baby...

1009
00:38:38,517 --> 00:38:40,919
But I don't want to be
that kind of person.

1010
00:38:40,952 --> 00:38:43,489
It's just not who I am.

1011
00:38:43,522 --> 00:38:45,757
* I'll be your warmth here...

1012
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:47,759
Actually, I do understand.

1013
00:38:47,793 --> 00:38:49,895
Um...

1014
00:38:49,928 --> 00:38:52,531
I may have strayed
from who I am as well.

1015
00:38:55,534 --> 00:38:57,536
* I'm holding your bag
for you... *

1016
00:38:57,569 --> 00:38:59,538
(sighs deeply)

1017
00:39:02,508 --> 00:39:04,710
* Please, baby,
back for bad love *

1018
00:39:04,743 --> 00:39:07,913
So I guess this is it.

1019
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:11,817
I guess so.

1020
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:15,521
* How can I wait?

1021
00:39:17,523 --> 00:39:20,859
* Holding your bag for you.

1022
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,629
Lucifer!

1023
00:39:23,662 --> 00:39:26,532
I'm here. You wanted to see me?

1024
00:39:26,565 --> 00:39:27,866
Yes, I wanted to check on you.

1025
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:31,403
That you were back to being
the good detective.

1026
00:39:31,437 --> 00:39:33,839
"The good detective"?

1027
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:35,941
Mm. Well, I like
our partnership much better

1028
00:39:35,974 --> 00:39:38,844
when you do all the work and
I'm the fun, irresponsible one.

1029
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:40,579
Oh. Yeah.

1030
00:39:40,612 --> 00:39:43,449
I did get a little carried
away at that reunion.
Hmm.

1031
00:39:43,482 --> 00:39:44,516
Just a smidge.

1032
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,751
(both chuckle softly)

1033
00:39:45,784 --> 00:39:48,987
Y-You know,
it made me realize something.

1034
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,823
(sighs) All of that high school
drama that I missed out on--

1035
00:39:51,857 --> 00:39:53,759
the-the girly gossip,

1036
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:55,861
the hallway crushes,

1037
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:58,530
all those school dances--

1038
00:39:58,564 --> 00:40:00,866
that's just not who I am. I...

1039
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:04,536
I like being
the responsible adult.

1040
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:05,771
Right.

1041
00:40:05,804 --> 00:40:09,741
So you no longer desire any
of that high school poppycock?

1042
00:40:09,775 --> 00:40:12,444
(sighs)
No.

1043
00:40:12,478 --> 00:40:14,980
Well then...
(clears throat)

1044
00:40:15,013 --> 00:40:18,784
I guess
you won't be wanting this.

1045
00:40:27,993 --> 00:40:29,528
Detective...

1046
00:40:30,829 --> 00:40:34,132
...will you go to the prom
with me?

1047
00:40:46,812 --> 00:40:48,814
("Only You" by Yazoo playing)

1048
00:40:51,082 --> 00:40:54,553
I can't believe you did this.

1049
00:40:55,821 --> 00:40:58,657
* Looking from a window above

1050
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:01,159
* It's like a story of love

1051
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:04,095
* Can you hear me?

1052
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:07,533
* Came back only yesterday

1053
00:41:07,566 --> 00:41:10,802
* I'm moving farther away

1054
00:41:10,836 --> 00:41:12,871
* Want you near me

1055
00:41:12,904 --> 00:41:15,106
* All I needed...

1056
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,075
Thank you, Lucifer.

1057
00:41:17,108 --> 00:41:18,944
* You gave

1058
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:20,812
* All I needed
for another day... *

1059
00:41:20,846 --> 00:41:22,948
I'm just glad you got
what you needed.

1060
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:24,683
* And all I ever knew

1061
00:41:24,716 --> 00:41:26,985
But you, you never found
that inspiration

1062
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:29,621
that you were looking for.

1063
00:41:29,655 --> 00:41:32,791
Are you ever gonna tell me what
it is you were trying to solve?

1064
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:36,795
Uh, it's-it's complicated.

1065
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:39,865
Well, tell me anyhow?

1066
00:41:39,898 --> 00:41:41,667
Very well.

1067
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,669
A long time ago,

1068
00:41:43,702 --> 00:41:46,572
dear old Dad put a curse on a...

1069
00:41:46,605 --> 00:41:48,774
well, a friend of mine.

1070
00:41:48,807 --> 00:41:51,142
And I want to break that curse,

1071
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:53,745
show my Father He's not
as powerful as He thinks,

1072
00:41:53,779 --> 00:41:55,814
that He can't control him.

1073
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:57,683
Or me.

1074
00:41:57,716 --> 00:42:00,118
Well, crazy metaphor aside,

1075
00:42:00,151 --> 00:42:02,654
can I offer some advice?

1076
00:42:02,688 --> 00:42:04,189
Oh...
(chuckles) please.

1077
00:42:04,222 --> 00:42:07,726
If I've learned anything
from this experience,

1078
00:42:07,759 --> 00:42:09,595
it's that it's better
to move forward

1079
00:42:09,628 --> 00:42:11,663
than stay stuck in the past.

1080
00:42:11,697 --> 00:42:14,600
It's just like Kathleen
realized.

1081
00:42:14,633 --> 00:42:16,902
We can't rewrite history.

1082
00:42:19,905 --> 00:42:22,708
You can't.

1083
00:42:22,741 --> 00:42:24,042
But maybe I can.

1084
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:26,612
(laughs):
Detective, you're a genius.

1085
00:42:26,645 --> 00:42:27,879
Thanks?

1086
00:42:27,913 --> 00:42:29,247
You've just given me my idea.

1087
00:42:30,716 --> 00:42:31,717
All I need to do is go back

1088
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:34,853
and undo the reason it exists
in the first place.

1089
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:36,755
Oh.
(laughs)

1090
00:42:36,788 --> 00:42:38,624
Thank you.

1091
00:42:38,657 --> 00:42:40,692
* You gave

1092
00:42:40,726 --> 00:42:44,195
* All I needed for another day

1093
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:47,766
* And all I ever knew

1094
00:42:47,799 --> 00:42:48,734
* Only you.
