1
00:00:01,969 --> 00:00:02,603
Previously on Lucifer...
I'm going to remove

2
00:00:02,636 --> 00:00:04,038
Pierce's immortal curse

3
00:00:04,072 --> 00:00:05,139
so he can finally die.

4
00:00:05,173 --> 00:00:06,307
I shall fly down to Hell,

5
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,077
pluck your brother's soul
and drop it into a vacant body.

6
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,380
This would make you innocent.

7
00:00:12,413 --> 00:00:13,847
Amenadiel's nice.
If he were nice,

8
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:17,118
he wouldn't be sneaking around
behind my back with my friend.

9
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:20,788
When will you understand that
we were trying to protect you?!

10
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:22,390
I don't believe you.

11
00:00:22,423 --> 00:00:24,392
I know this is scary,
but we need to start

12
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:25,826
in your Hell.
AMENADIEL: There are

13
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,396
so many things that Father
can still take away from you.

14
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:29,797
CHLOE:
There is a bomb.

15
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:30,664
DAN: If they move,
the whole thing blows.

16
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:32,600
I just wanted
to say thank you again.

17
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:34,602
Couldn't have done it
without you.
Without me,

18
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:36,604
you wouldn't have been in danger
in the first place.

19
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:38,839
If the detective had died,
it would have been my fault.

20
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,408
I know I promised

21
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:41,342
to help you end your curse,

22
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,711
but we need to dissolve
our unholy alliance.

23
00:00:43,744 --> 00:00:47,181
The risk is too great.

24
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:51,585
(upbeat dance music intro plays,
crowd cheering)

25
00:01:07,335 --> 00:01:09,303
(sighs)
I'll put it on.

26
00:01:09,337 --> 00:01:11,739
*

27
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:15,409
MAN:
Ladies and gentlemen, Axara!

28
00:01:15,443 --> 00:01:17,311
* Boy

29
00:01:17,345 --> 00:01:21,515
* I just,
I-I can't explain it. I... *

30
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:24,718
* I see her face
* Everywhere *

31
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:26,854
* Everywhere
* Everywhere *

32
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:28,422
* About two weeks ago

33
00:01:28,456 --> 00:01:30,324
* Remember that night
when you came on over? *

34
00:01:30,358 --> 00:01:31,825
* I got a confession

35
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:33,827
* I saw everything
you wrote her *

36
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:35,629
* How could you call her baby?

37
00:01:35,663 --> 00:01:37,331
* I saw the pic she sent you

38
00:01:37,365 --> 00:01:39,467
* Why would you lie and tell her
that there's so much *

39
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,469
* We have been through
ever since *

40
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:42,470
* That night...

41
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:45,839
(audience gasping)

42
00:01:47,675 --> 00:01:49,743
Oh, my God, Jill?

43
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:51,645
Jill?
MAN: Stay back!
Everyone, stay back!

44
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:53,381
Jill?

45
00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:56,350
Oh, Jill.

46
00:01:56,384 --> 00:01:57,551
Jill?

47
00:01:57,585 --> 00:01:59,353
Help me!

48
00:01:59,387 --> 00:02:00,788
Someone help!

49
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:03,524
Somebody help!

50
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:04,792
(crying)

51
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,868
I've decided to take myself out
of the spotlight.

52
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:17,705
My Father's spotlight,
to be exact.

53
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:20,841
So, no more killing Pierce
to get back at your dad?

54
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:22,610
Correct.

55
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,545
I mean, that whole "mark of
Kane" thing was so dreary,

56
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:25,913
so nihilistic.

57
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:27,915
There are far better ways
to spend my time.

58
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:29,483
Oh?
Yes.

59
00:02:29,517 --> 00:02:32,386
Well, I could brew my own
artisanal beer.

60
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,423
Take a nude painting class.

61
00:02:35,456 --> 00:02:38,392
Buy that pet shark
I've always wanted.

62
00:02:38,426 --> 00:02:40,594
Maybe you're taking a step back
because of the bomb scare

63
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:44,398
that threatened
both you... and Chloe.

64
00:02:44,432 --> 00:02:45,399
Don't be ridiculous.

65
00:02:45,433 --> 00:02:47,535
We're in the line of fire
every day, Doctor.

66
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:48,636
I mean, it's all part
of being heroes

67
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,671
for the people.
Don't get me wrong.

68
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:53,707
If the bomb was God targeting
Chloe for your defiance,

69
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:56,510
then maybe it's good
that you're quitting.

70
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:58,546
Well, quitting is a strong word.

71
00:02:58,579 --> 00:02:59,747
I'm just saying,

72
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,815
sometimes we push boundaries
we shouldn't

73
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:04,552
and cause rifts with
people we care about.

74
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:05,619
It's only fair

75
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:08,556
we take our share
of responsibility in a conflict,

76
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:12,693
even if the other is...
somewhat irrational,

77
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:15,563
demonic, even.

78
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:16,830
Indeed. Nothing wrong

79
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,632
with dousing the flames
of contention.

80
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,834
Exactly.
Right.

81
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:23,771
Maybe even apologize.
Well, let's not go crazy.

82
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:27,841
But perhaps I can stop poking
the bear that is my Father.

83
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,444
Get off his radar
for a bit, you know?

84
00:03:30,478 --> 00:03:32,480
Mellow out.

85
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:36,450
(playing "Dust in the Wind"
by Kansas)

86
00:03:36,484 --> 00:03:40,988
* I close my eyes

87
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:43,591
* Only for a moment

88
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:45,893
* And the moment's gone...

89
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:47,561
(stops playing)

90
00:03:47,595 --> 00:03:48,762
What do you want, Lopez?

91
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:51,999
You know, I just noticed that
you may be a little blue.

92
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:54,001
So...

93
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:56,003
Ta-da!

94
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:57,571
To cheer you up.

95
00:03:57,605 --> 00:03:58,972
No, it's not new
kicks. It's better.

96
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:01,742
It's... a compliment box.

97
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:03,844
I went around the precinct
and asked everyone

98
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:06,013
to write a positive
little note about you.

99
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:07,481
Why?
So...

100
00:04:07,515 --> 00:04:09,049
that whenever
you're feeling down,

101
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,919
you can just pull one out,
and it'll perk you right up.

102
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:16,990
Like, maybe now
would be a good time.

103
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,726
(clears throat)

104
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,728
"Pierce has nice arms."

105
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:23,697
Well, agreed. You sure do.

106
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:26,567
"The lieutenant has
really great arms."

107
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,902
Right again.
Two arms, two compliments.

108
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:33,040
"Pierce...

109
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:34,642
"is...

110
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:38,011
"wicked smart, so funny,

111
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:40,914
generous and amazing."

112
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,517
Now that is a compliment.

113
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:45,052
It says I have really nice arms,
doesn't it?

114
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:47,921
Nah, nah, 'cause
that'd be really awkward

115
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:50,691
and weird, you and me here
talking about a third arm.

116
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:54,662
And, um, I need to go
check on a lab thingy.

117
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:56,730
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

118
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:58,532
I've been trying so
hard to cheer up Pierce,

119
00:04:58,566 --> 00:05:01,602
but this is some
next level bro-wallow.

120
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,571
You got to get in there
and do something.

121
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:05,839
Yeah. I don't know.

122
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:08,075
What? Why not?
Well, it's just...

123
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:11,545
Pierce isn't really a fan of me.

124
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:12,946
Well, then this is your
chance to change that.

125
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,049
I mean, Dan, if anyone
knows what it feels like

126
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,951
to be in the crapper, it's you.

127
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:21,088
Thank you.
No. What I mean is
you can relate, okay?

128
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:23,757
But when you're
down, you always,

129
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:26,660
always pull yourself back up.

130
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:29,963
You are positive
dude numero uno.

131
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:34,067
Okay. I guess I could try.

132
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:35,703
Good luck.

133
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:37,004
You got this.

134
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:38,372
Hmm.

135
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,710
* All we are is dust
in the wind... *

136
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,116
CHLOE: Okay,
I'm a little confused here.

137
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:51,885
One of the backup dancers
was dressed as Axara?

138
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,587
Yeah. I don't really
understand it, either.
Yeah.

139
00:05:53,621 --> 00:05:54,955
It normally doesn't
happen like that.
I think

140
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:57,791
she was looking to get...
Okay, but you're
the manager, correct?

141
00:05:57,825 --> 00:05:58,792
Rohan Donahue, yeah.

142
00:05:58,826 --> 00:05:59,793
So, here's the deal.

143
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:01,995
Axara and a backup dancer, Jill,

144
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,698
decided to switch positions
last minute.

145
00:06:04,732 --> 00:06:06,867
Maybe she felt the act
was getting boring.

146
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,736
You'll have to ask Axara
for details.

147
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:10,738
We got her back to the hotel
as fast as possible.

148
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:13,006
So was this the first time
she had switched?

149
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,142
Yeah, she didn't say anything
to anyone on the crew.

150
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:17,745
Except for Jill, of course.

151
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:21,014
And no one knew, that means
Axara was the intended target.

152
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,616
CHLOE: Let's not jump
to any conclusions

153
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:23,884
until we've explored
all the angles.

154
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,619
We don't know
if anyone was a target.

155
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:26,620
Maybe it was an accident.

156
00:06:26,654 --> 00:06:27,721
ELLA:
It wasn't.

157
00:06:27,755 --> 00:06:31,024
This is a piece of big-time
professional firework.

158
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,426
From far away: "Ooh!"

159
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,827
From up close: "Ah!"

160
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:34,895
Fireworks weren't even

161
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:35,829
part of Axara's show.

162
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:37,831
Let alone pointed
right at the spotlight.

163
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:39,833
Does this mean we're cancelling
the Asia and the Europe tours?

164
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:43,170
Let's not panic until we know
exactly what happened here.

165
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:44,905
Jill's dead, Rohan.

166
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:46,740
And it was supposed to be Axara.

167
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:50,043
Yes, which means the shadowy
assassin would likely try again.

168
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,945
And again,

169
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:54,047
until the butchery
is done.

170
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,649
Statistically speaking.

171
00:06:55,683 --> 00:06:56,750
CECE: He's right.
Okay.

172
00:06:56,784 --> 00:06:57,851
As long as Axara's
in the spotlight,

173
00:06:57,885 --> 00:06:59,186
she has a target on her back.

174
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:00,654
(quietly):
Yes.

175
00:07:00,688 --> 00:07:02,856
The spotlight
is dangerous.

176
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,191
(chuckling):
Who am I kidding?

177
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:05,058
I'm not mellow.

178
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,760
I'll never be able
to take myself out

179
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:08,796
of my dad's spotlight, but...

180
00:07:10,698 --> 00:07:13,166
I can take the detective
out of mine.

181
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,902
And focus
on other people.

182
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,704
What? What are you
talking about?

183
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:18,071
Nothing.

184
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,773
You'll thank me later.

185
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:23,911
*

186
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:32,786
LUCIFER: So you're Axara's
bodyguard, are you?

187
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,954
Now, I've always had an interest

188
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:36,089
in the personal
protection business, Rob.

189
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:38,091
Bob.
Bob, right.

190
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,226
Is that short
for "Robert"?

191
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:40,694
No.

192
00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:41,895
Fascinating.

193
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:43,697
Oh, it's lovely getting
to know you like this.

194
00:07:43,731 --> 00:07:45,999
(chuckles) Your hopes,
your dreams. Hmm?

195
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:47,100
(chuckles)

196
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,102
Been working out as well.

197
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,203
Are you coming?

198
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:52,740
Uh, no, I'm not really
interested in you

199
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:54,207
and what you're doing. I think
I'm just gonna stay here

200
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:55,976
and chat to
my new friend, Rob.

201
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:57,110
Bob.
Bob.

202
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,512
Right. Bob.

203
00:07:58,546 --> 00:07:59,847
Big fan of old
Bobby here.

204
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,281
In fact, if someone
were wondering about

205
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:05,753
my list of favorite people,
Bob might just be at the top.

206
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:06,987
Really?

207
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,255
Oh, most definitely.

208
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:09,723
* New year,
but the ball don't drop... *

209
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:12,526
We should go upstairs.

210
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,795
* Come on, party getting wild,
get hot... *

211
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:18,065
LUCIFER (coughing):
Thank you, Bobby.

212
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:20,934
(Chloe clears throat)
LUCIFER: I thought rock stars
only got the best weed.

213
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:22,736
It's sage.

214
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,873
After what happened to Jill,
I'm smudging my space,

215
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:27,741
and my heart.

216
00:08:27,775 --> 00:08:28,709
(whispers):
And my lungs.

217
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:29,943
It actually changes
the ionic composition

218
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:31,278
of the air and reduces

219
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:33,747
the body's stress response
to tragic events.

220
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:34,882
Oh, such compassion

221
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:35,916
from one so young.

222
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:37,150
(chuckles)
Please, tell me more.

223
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:39,553
CHLOE: Can you think of anyone
who may have wanted to hurt you?

224
00:08:39,587 --> 00:08:41,555
(chuckles) You should check
Axara's social media.

225
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:43,290
So many obsessed crazies.

226
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:44,758
Love you, Cece.

227
00:08:44,792 --> 00:08:46,293
And she makes a mean
turmeric smoothie.

228
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:47,828
(chuckles)

229
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,797
Wait, speaking of mean,

230
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,065
there was one guy who did
kind of threaten me.

231
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:53,867
I mean, I didn't take it
seriously at the time

232
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:55,569
because he's a bit
of a diva, but...

233
00:08:55,603 --> 00:08:57,304
Patrick.
Patrick.

234
00:08:57,337 --> 00:08:58,972
And who might Patrick be?

235
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:00,808
My ex-backup singer.

236
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:02,576
Really toxic
individual.

237
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,579
Rohan fired him last week, and
like I said, he's a drama queen.

238
00:09:05,613 --> 00:09:06,914
But he said something

239
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:07,948
like, uh,

240
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:10,984
"I hope Axara dies
a horrible, painful death."

241
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:12,052
Yes.

242
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,121
Mm, mm.

243
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:16,824
Suppose it might
be worth a glance.

244
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:19,092
* It's the party over here

245
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:22,896
* We don't feel
like letting go. *

246
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,932
(exhales)

247
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,806
Maze, it's-it's me.

248
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,974
Linda.

249
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:38,812
Come on, Maze, I...
(chuckles)

250
00:09:38,846 --> 00:09:43,951
I brought you a gift to,
you know, bury the hatchet.

251
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:47,921
I don't want
to lose you, Maze.

252
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:50,858
And so,

253
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:53,126
I lost Amenadiel.

254
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,664
No man is worth
what we have.

255
00:09:58,866 --> 00:10:01,334
Please, just hear me out.

256
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:12,145
(footfalls leaving)

257
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:19,987
(sighs)

258
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,056
Oh, excuse us, I think we're in
the wrong interrogation room.

259
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,257
You're looking
for Patrick Manning?

260
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,059
Yes.

261
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:28,128
That's me, honey.
LUCIFER:
Wow.

262
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:30,263
I see someone stole some
of Axara's spotlight

263
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,900
and fishnets as severance pay.

264
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:34,001
Why am I here?

265
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:35,335
I'll ask the questions, Patty.

266
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:38,138
Oh, I always knew Cher
was a feisty one.

267
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:40,273
I'm Donovan McCann,
Patrick's lawyer.

268
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,876
So, why is he here?

269
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,011
CHLOE: We believe
that Patrick made

270
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:46,146
an attempt on Axara's life
last night.

271
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,248
Killed a backup dancer
by mistake.

272
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:49,282
Say what?
We know that
you still

273
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:51,151
had the backstage security pass,

274
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:52,352
which means
access and motive.

275
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:53,954
LUCIFER: Yes,
cold-blooded retaliation

276
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,022
for your recent firing.

277
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:56,089
Firing?

278
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:57,257
That's bananas.

279
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,458
So you're saying
you didn't try

280
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,193
and take Axara
out with a bang?

281
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:01,094
Course not.

282
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:02,095
PATRICK:
Do I hate her?

283
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:02,963
Yes.

284
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,998
It was a bitch
to work for that bitch--

285
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:07,034
the long hours,
never getting credit--

286
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:08,435
but she did not fire me.

287
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:09,937
I quit.

288
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,104
That's not the story her people
are telling.

289
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:13,306
I bet. Those sycophants
will say anything

290
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,908
to protect
her fragile ego.

291
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:17,444
Well, Patrick. Patty.

292
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:19,713
If you didn't want Axara dead,
tell me:

293
00:11:19,747 --> 00:11:22,182
what did you desire?

294
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:26,053
Uh... to be Axara.

295
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:27,721
But my version.

296
00:11:27,755 --> 00:11:29,456
A better version.

297
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:32,726
Which is why I could never
want her dead.

298
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,297
How could I compete with her
if she was kaput?

299
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,733
Yes.

300
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:44,972
Where were you last night?

301
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:46,273
On stage.

302
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:49,342
Performing my act at
the Hideaway in WeHo.

303
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:52,245
After which, she was mobbed
by fans in the parking lot.

304
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,346
Tuesday's the new Friday

305
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,082
now that Patty's
doing Axara.

306
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:57,384
Mm-hmm.
Ask around.

307
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:58,986
(chuckles)
Aw, so sweet.

308
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:00,954
Donovan was right
about last night.

309
00:12:00,988 --> 00:12:02,355
It was cray-cray
at the Hideaway.

310
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:06,493
Everyone wants a piece
of Axara 2.0. (scoffs)

311
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:08,962
You wouldn't believe
the obsessive wannabes.

312
00:12:08,996 --> 00:12:11,765
Sad.
It's sad.

313
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:14,234
ELLA: Axara has more followers
than the Pope.

314
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:17,170
"You are my life, I would do
anything to meet you.

315
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:18,305
Literally anything."

316
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:21,775
Gosh, I can't think of anyone
I care about that much.

317
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:25,512
Except for Miss Lopez.

318
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:26,246
ELLA:
World's Greatest

319
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,548
Forensic Scientist?
(chuckles)

320
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,450
Oh, my gosh.

321
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,519
That is so sweet.

322
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:34,454
Wait. Did I miss my birthday?

323
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:37,457
Well, every day's a celebration
when you're around, darling.

324
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,192
Mwah!
(chuckles)

325
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:42,195
Anyway.

326
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:45,398
When obsessed people don't
have their love reciprocated,

327
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,200
sometimes they snap.

328
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:48,535
Well, I've gone through
them all,

329
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:51,004
and on a scale of #ILoveYouAxara

330
00:12:51,038 --> 00:12:53,006
to #IWantToLiveInYourSpleen,

331
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,541
there's, like,
a zillion suspects.

332
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:57,010
A zillion and one
if you count me.

333
00:12:57,044 --> 00:12:58,511
You weren't even aware of her
until this case.

334
00:12:58,545 --> 00:12:59,212
(scoffs)

335
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:00,580
Okay, name your favorite song.

336
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,050
Well, um,
there's so many.

337
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,018
CHLOE: Anyway, we're not just
looking for a crazy fan,

338
00:13:05,052 --> 00:13:08,021
we need someone who had
an all-access pass.

339
00:13:08,055 --> 00:13:09,556
Well, Axara's assistant
let me check out

340
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:11,825
all of her
social media accounts.
Mm-hmm.

341
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:14,227
And apparently, she held
an online contest last week.

342
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:18,298
Winner won a VIP pass to
the Hollywood Bowl show.

343
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:21,301
Meet our winner: Benny Parker.

344
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:24,337
And these
are some of his tweets.

345
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:26,840
CHLOE: "I can't wait
for our love to be real."

346
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:29,576
"I will make you feel
the same way."

347
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:32,045
"You and I will be
together forever."

348
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,847
That's subtle.

349
00:13:33,881 --> 00:13:35,582
LUCIFER:
Sounds like Prince Charming

350
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,251
needs some attention
from the LAPD.

351
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:40,087
Right.

352
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,521
Thank you, Miss Lopez.

353
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,356
I mean...

354
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:47,327
* I'm a panda bear.

355
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,263
Oh, no,
poor Pauline.

356
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:51,364
Pauline?

357
00:13:51,398 --> 00:13:54,134
My friend who works the
intake desk at the precinct.

358
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,435
I'm helping her through
a bad breakup.

359
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:58,171
We've grown quite close
since yesterday.

360
00:13:58,205 --> 00:14:00,507
Mm-hmm. Right.

361
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,242
I know what you're doing.

362
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:07,214
Our bomb scare made you realize
just how dangerous this job is.

363
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:09,282
And that you and I
could lose each other.

364
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:10,483
At any time.

365
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,085
So you're focusing
on other people,

366
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:13,353
you're keeping
your distance

367
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:15,322
as a way of protecting yourself.

368
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,489
And you know what, Lucifer?

369
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:17,624
That's cool.

370
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:20,093
If you need to
"reverse-Oprah" me

371
00:14:20,127 --> 00:14:21,394
just to feel
less afraid,

372
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:23,563
then by all means,
knock yourself out.

373
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:26,499
(scoffs) What?
I am not afraid.

374
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,568
Just realized I've been
a tad myopic lately.

375
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,337
Why not spread
the love?
Hmm.

376
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,205
I mean, everyone deserves
a little Lucifer.

377
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:33,340
How generous of you.

378
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,374
Thank you very much.

379
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:37,110
After me.
(clears throat)

380
00:14:37,144 --> 00:14:38,278
(inhales deeply)

381
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:39,646
(knocking on door)

382
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:43,516
Benny Parker, LAPD.

383
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,385
Seems I'm not the only one
ignoring you.

384
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:48,321
Perhaps you're just not
that interesting, Detective.

385
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:51,424
Benny?

386
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:03,903
Benny.

387
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:09,576
Well, talk about a dead end.

388
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:17,550
"Axara's art celebrates life.
I tarnished it with death.

389
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,452
"I have no right
to stay in her world.

390
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:21,421
"I lived for Axara.

391
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:24,691
"Now I die for her.

392
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:27,427
Benny."

393
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,428
Wow.

394
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:31,264
I hope that no one ever
loves me that much.

395
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:33,366
So, did the M.E. confirm
that it's suicide?

396
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,701
Still running
the autopsy report,

397
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:36,436
but the bottle
of sleeping pills

398
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:38,438
found in his hand,
half empty.

399
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:41,374
Right and factor in Benny's VIP
pass which means he had access.

400
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:42,475
Yeah, it means that Benny

401
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:44,311
had tons of time
and opportunity

402
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:45,678
to plant the firework
that killed Jill.

403
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:49,216
A textbook post-murder
guilt-driven suicide.

404
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:51,184
A little too textbook
if you ask me.

405
00:15:51,218 --> 00:15:52,986
LUCIFER: Oh, look
what just arrived.

406
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,288
Who wants a T-shirt?
Here you go.

407
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:57,457
And, oh, one for you.
WOMAN: Nice.

408
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,492
One for you.

409
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:02,595
(chuckles)
Definitely for you.

410
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,464
What you can't fix,
decorate, am I right?

411
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:05,532
Ah!

412
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:07,767
Miss Lopez.

413
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,769
Aw.
(chuckles)

414
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,371
What is all this?

415
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:12,505
Axara swag.

416
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:14,207
Thank you gifts for
solving the case.

417
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:15,475
Apparently, she'd have
come in person,

418
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:16,776
but she's busy rehearsing

419
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,611
for her rescheduled show
at the Bowl.

420
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,347
Well, technically,
the case isn't closed

421
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,682
till we get the
final autopsy report.
Exactly.

422
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:25,452
And until then,
it's LAPD jurisdiction.

423
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,619
Which means no shows.

424
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,388
Well, I'm afraid
you'll have to take it up

425
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:29,756
with the police commissioner
'cause apparently,

426
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:32,292
he and Axara are poker buddies.
It's all be sorted.

427
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,527
(chuckling):
Oh, hello.

428
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:36,663
(chuckles)
An Axara bobblehead.

429
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:39,232
* I'm not gonna die no more.

430
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:42,269
(chuckles) Who's deserving
of this little, uh...

431
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:45,705
Ah! My good friend,

432
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:48,775
Mr. Janitor.

433
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:50,777
That should cheer you up.

434
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,246
CHARLOTTE:
I think you'll be very proud.

435
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,549
I forced myself
to speak to a coworker who

436
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:57,717
has terrible breath.

437
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,486
It was probably only
for a few minutes,

438
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,821
but it seemed
like a decade.

439
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:06,393
Hello, I'm trying
to compliment my-- you.

440
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:07,727
(chuckles)

441
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,663
Clearly, something is
on your mind.

442
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,565
Come on, I'm all ears.

443
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,268
I am so sorry.
(chuckles)

444
00:17:15,302 --> 00:17:18,438
Um, but you're paying me
to listen, so...

445
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:20,673
Well, yes. But the whole reason
that I'm here

446
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:23,810
is to learn to be less
self-centered.

447
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:26,113
Okay, um...

448
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:28,848
Okay, fine.

449
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:33,386
Um, I'm, I'm just having
a wee bit of a conflict

450
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,755
with a, with a friend of mine.

451
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:39,492
Conflict? My specialty.
(laughs)

452
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:42,829
(laughing):
Mediating... conflict, I mean.

453
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:44,497
Let me help you.

454
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:46,099
Uh, that's very nice.

455
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:47,700
It's a very nice offer, but...

456
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:50,870
I know. And it feels
so strange. It's...

457
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,106
I feel so good,
it's like I'm floating.

458
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,841
Although that might...

459
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:58,077
might be the three gimlets
I had at lunch.

460
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:01,381
So, yes?

461
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,516
Uh...

462
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,518
Oh, my God. Chloe.

463
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:06,819
Okay, so you know
how you thought

464
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:08,855
Axara's superfan's "suicide"

465
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:10,590
was a little too
neatly wrapped up?

466
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:11,624
Mm-hmm.

467
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:13,526
You just won the super

468
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,128
totally right hunch
of the millennia award.

469
00:18:15,162 --> 00:18:17,330
So Benny's not our guy?
No.

470
00:18:17,364 --> 00:18:20,600
Benny died the day before
that firework exploded.

471
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:23,336
So Benny is not our killer.

472
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,438
He's our first murder victim.

473
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:28,608
So Benny's suicide was staged
before the attack at the Bowl.

474
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:30,743
Yeah. A frame job to cover up
the real killer's tracks

475
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:33,146
which means major
pre-meditation.

476
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,415
And that Axara's still
in serious danger.

477
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:36,449
The killer's still out there.

478
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:37,484
Exactly.

479
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:39,352
LUCIFER: This
month's winner is...

480
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:42,655
Pauline. (laughs)

481
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:44,657
And I think we can
all agree that Pauline

482
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:46,793
deserves her place
in the spotlight

483
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:48,428
far more than others.

484
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:49,896
So if you'd all like to

485
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:52,932
raise a glass,
if you have one, to Pauline.

486
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:56,869
Lucifer knows
she's a temp, right?

487
00:18:56,903 --> 00:19:00,907
Yeah, just tell him
to meet me in the car.
Yeah.

488
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,543
*

489
00:19:05,712 --> 00:19:07,480
I don't know exactly what
you're going through,

490
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:08,581
but I've been there.

491
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:10,917
That very stool,
actually.

492
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,552
Have you, Espinoza?

493
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:14,787
You know, talking about it
might help.

494
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,489
You know,
really opening up to someone.

495
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:18,491
I mean, that's what...
that's what I did.

496
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:20,927
And now everything's
coming up Dan.

497
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,563
No, seriously, man,
I'm happy.

498
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:25,598
You know, I'm-I'm ready
to start dating.

499
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:27,166
Hell, you and I
are even friends. (chuckles)

500
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:31,438
Friendlier.

501
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:33,540
(sighs)

502
00:19:34,941 --> 00:19:36,809
I guess I could try.

503
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,811
Lay it on me.

504
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:40,713
I'm here for you, bro.

505
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:44,517
It's just life, you know?

506
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:48,955
It's like this eternal wasteland
of meaningless existence,

507
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:52,692
a dark void staring
down at you

508
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:56,963
like a beaten dog scrounging
on the side of the road,

509
00:19:56,996 --> 00:20:01,768
just waiting to get mowed down
by the next tsunami of crap.

510
00:20:08,608 --> 00:20:10,443
Wow.

511
00:20:10,477 --> 00:20:12,211
Hmm.

512
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:17,016
Maybe we all are just
dust in the wind.

513
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,519
* Bring out the bad in me

514
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:22,455
* Bring out the bad

515
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:24,023
* Bring out the.

516
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,493
I am not cancelling my show.

517
00:20:26,526 --> 00:20:28,461
Well, it turns out
that your troubled fan

518
00:20:28,495 --> 00:20:30,597
was framed
for Jill's murder.

519
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,031
So, with the killer
still out there,

520
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,733
I can't let you perform
tomorrow night.

521
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:36,469
Detective, if I hid under a rock
every time there was an issue,

522
00:20:36,503 --> 00:20:37,870
I'd still be doing bar mitzvahs.

523
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:39,872
Also, you'd be under
a rock. Most unpleasant.

524
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:40,940
Okay.

525
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:43,510
Detective.

526
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:45,745
Now, I say we let
Pinhead sing.

527
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:46,879
I mean, after all,
some people

528
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,615
are just destined to
be in the spotlight.

529
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:49,949
Others not. Like
you, for example.

530
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:50,883
So not helping.

531
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:53,019
You know, maybe you
should wait in the car.

532
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:54,787
AXARA: You know what?
Maybe you should both go.

533
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:56,489
I assure you, I'm fine.

534
00:20:56,523 --> 00:20:57,657
(gunshots)

535
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,025
(woman screams)

536
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:00,593
Detective, what are you doing?!

537
00:21:00,627 --> 00:21:01,628
This is...

538
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:03,596
no time for heroics.

539
00:21:04,331 --> 00:21:06,833
Not that I care.

540
00:21:11,538 --> 00:21:13,873
MAN: Building searched.
All clear.

541
00:21:13,906 --> 00:21:15,508
You poor, poor dear.

542
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:16,876
Can I get you something?
Some tea?

543
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:18,911
More face needles,
perhaps?

544
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:21,047
Uh, I'm fine, your partner's
actually the one with the medic.

545
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,782
Who?

546
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:24,317
Oh, her.

547
00:21:24,351 --> 00:21:25,918
No, that's, uh,
that's just a scratch.

548
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:26,919
No, it's you

549
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:28,588
that I'm focused on.
(chuckles)

550
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,523
CHLOE: Okay, great.
Thank you.

551
00:21:30,557 --> 00:21:32,825
Okay, so I have your
security team in place.

552
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:34,527
For tomorrow's show, right?

553
00:21:34,561 --> 00:21:35,628
Smart to beef things up.

554
00:21:35,662 --> 00:21:36,663
Yeah, I don't think
you understand.

555
00:21:36,696 --> 00:21:37,697
There's no show.

556
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:38,998
While you're in danger,
you're under

557
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,668
24-hour LAPD protection,
led by me.

558
00:21:41,701 --> 00:21:43,803
That's ridiculous.
LUCIFER: Agreed.

559
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:44,937
She's a terrible choice.

560
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:46,339
I'll do it.

561
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:49,542
Look what we found
in the laundry chute.

562
00:21:49,576 --> 00:21:50,843
I'm gonna head back to the
homestead to expedite
ballistics.

563
00:21:50,877 --> 00:21:52,779
You want to come?
Excellent plan.

564
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:53,946
Why don't you go
with Miss Lopez,

565
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,816
and I will keep you safe,

566
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:58,851
you little gem.

567
00:21:58,885 --> 00:22:00,353
So you're gonna be my bodyguard?

568
00:22:00,387 --> 00:22:02,855
Are you even a real cop?

569
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:04,824
Consultant, actually.
But I can assure you

570
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:06,759
that my penthouse
has top-notch security.

571
00:22:06,793 --> 00:22:09,929
And every other amenity
you could possibly desire.

572
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:11,130
Hmm.

573
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,865
We'll see.

574
00:22:13,766 --> 00:22:15,368
Come on, girls.

575
00:22:15,402 --> 00:22:16,603
(exhales)

576
00:22:16,636 --> 00:22:19,038
(sighs)
What a treasure.

577
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:20,840
(chuckles)
Okay,

578
00:22:20,873 --> 00:22:23,676
the only reason I'm agreeing
to this is hiding Axara

579
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:26,112
at your penthouse is
an unpredictable choice.

580
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:28,781
But, listen, if there's
even the slightest hint

581
00:22:28,815 --> 00:22:30,850
that she is unsafe,

582
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:32,785
your duties are revoked.

583
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:33,986
(scoffs)
Right.

584
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:34,887
What?

585
00:22:34,921 --> 00:22:36,889
Just, you said "duties."

586
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,399
*

587
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,702
Come on.
(elevator dings)

588
00:22:49,736 --> 00:22:50,970
* About two weeks ago

589
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:53,172
* Remember that night
when you came on over *

590
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,741
* I got a confession

591
00:22:54,774 --> 00:22:56,142
* I saw everything
you wrote her *

592
00:22:56,175 --> 00:22:57,610
* How could
you call her baby? *

593
00:22:57,644 --> 00:22:59,612
* I saw the pics she sent you

594
00:22:59,646 --> 00:23:00,713
* Why would you lie
and tell her that... *

595
00:23:00,747 --> 00:23:03,616
(music stops)
Bravo, Miss Axara.

596
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,818
Yes, I adore
your shaky groove thing.

597
00:23:05,852 --> 00:23:07,420
And I'm sure
my custom

598
00:23:07,454 --> 00:23:09,822
Italian leather settee
does, too.
Sorry,

599
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:11,023
I need to rehearse.

600
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:12,024
Right, yes, of course.
Of course.

601
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:13,760
Whatever you need.
(chuckles)

602
00:23:13,793 --> 00:23:15,027
(whispers): Help me.
Right, uh, chaps,

603
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:16,829
why don't you, um...

604
00:23:16,863 --> 00:23:17,930
you wait downstairs.

605
00:23:17,964 --> 00:23:19,432
I've got this.

606
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:20,933
Thank you, Rob.
Bob.

607
00:23:20,967 --> 00:23:22,635
Bob. Bob, yes.

608
00:23:22,669 --> 00:23:25,672
(sighs)
Now, please tell me,

609
00:23:25,705 --> 00:23:29,008
how can I better focus
my attention on you?

610
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:30,710
Mm...

611
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:32,044
Maybe you can
make yourself useful.

612
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:33,846
Unless that's just a prop.

613
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,749
(chuckles)
Prop? Please.

614
00:23:36,783 --> 00:23:38,951
Mozart, Liberace, Elton.

615
00:23:38,985 --> 00:23:41,921
Who?
All the greats were my pupils.

616
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:43,923
But none as bright as you,
of course.

617
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:45,958
Whatever.
(clears throat)

618
00:23:45,992 --> 00:23:47,660
Right.
(clears throat)

619
00:23:47,694 --> 00:23:48,661
"C."

620
00:23:48,695 --> 00:23:49,962
(plays note)

621
00:23:49,996 --> 00:23:51,898
(playing scale)
* La, la, la,
la, la, la *

622
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:55,201
(misplays)
* La, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la *

623
00:23:55,234 --> 00:23:56,869
* Don't let it
happen again. *

624
00:23:56,903 --> 00:23:58,938
* I won't.
(plays note)

625
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:00,239
(playing scale)
* La, la, la

626
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,741
(off-key):
* La...

627
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:03,676
(groans)
Voice of an angel.

628
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,978
God, it would be if your A-flat
wasn't out of tune.

629
00:24:06,012 --> 00:24:07,880
I beg your pardon?

630
00:24:07,914 --> 00:24:09,081
Perhaps it's you who's...

631
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:11,884
whose perfect pitch

632
00:24:11,918 --> 00:24:13,486
allows you to hear
what others...

633
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,854
(playing note)
...cannot.

634
00:24:14,887 --> 00:24:15,722
Um...
Hmm.

635
00:24:15,755 --> 00:24:17,089
(plays note)
You know what, never mind.

636
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:18,157
I need a break anyway.

637
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,826
Is this my smoothie stuff?

638
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:21,994
Yes. Yes, but,
uh, please,

639
00:24:22,028 --> 00:24:26,699
allow me to shower you with
my culinary expertise.

640
00:24:26,733 --> 00:24:28,234
Right.

641
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:30,102
W-Wait, are...
No, no, no.

642
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:31,738
Aren't you gonna
wash them first?

643
00:24:31,771 --> 00:24:33,873
And rinse off all the
nutrients? Don't be silly.

644
00:24:33,906 --> 00:24:36,108
Uh... (chuckles)
Hold on.

645
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:38,210
Wh-Where's my
fresh turmeric?

646
00:24:38,244 --> 00:24:40,813
You can't make it
without the right ingredients.

647
00:24:40,847 --> 00:24:41,914
I couldn't agree more.

648
00:24:41,948 --> 00:24:44,116
Just-just stop.
Just let me do it.

649
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,985
Please, forget it.
I will...

650
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:47,820
You don't even know
what you're doing.
(stammers)

651
00:24:47,854 --> 00:24:49,922
Do this, Miss Axara!
(gasps)

652
00:24:49,956 --> 00:24:52,992
You've got
to be kidding me.

653
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:55,027
ROHAN:
Everyone loves Axara.

654
00:24:55,061 --> 00:24:57,129
What kind of psycho
would want to gun her down

655
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:58,731
in cold blood like that?

656
00:24:58,765 --> 00:24:59,799
It's you.

657
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,267
What?
The gun

658
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,035
that we found
at the Roosevelt,

659
00:25:03,069 --> 00:25:05,271
turns out that it's
registered to you.

660
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:07,006
Oh, this is insane.

661
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,208
I mean, that looks like my gun.

662
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:11,210
I keep it in the tour bus
for protection.

663
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:13,212
But someone must've stolen it.
We also uncovered

664
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:16,282
the insurance policy
that you took out on Axara.

665
00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:18,317
Apparently, if anything
happens to her,

666
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,886
you get a huge chunk of change.

667
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,788
Is that also insane?

668
00:25:21,821 --> 00:25:22,789
First of all,

669
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:25,291
I would die if anything happened
to that girl.

670
00:25:25,324 --> 00:25:29,161
Secondly, all managers have
insurance policies like that.

671
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:30,162
But, trust me,

672
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:31,330
the payout is nothing compared

673
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,866
to managing an entire career.

674
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,135
Why would I kill the goose
for one egg?

675
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:37,870
I don't know. Maybe the goose

676
00:25:37,904 --> 00:25:39,872
is a pain
in the ass.

677
00:25:39,906 --> 00:25:41,173
Okay.

678
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:45,177
Unless you've got something else
to say, I'm leaving.

679
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:46,979
I do have something
else to say.

680
00:25:47,013 --> 00:25:48,781
You're under arrest
for the murder

681
00:25:48,815 --> 00:25:50,316
of Jill Murray,
Benny Parker,

682
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:53,085
and the attempted murder
of Axara.

683
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:54,086
No!

684
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:54,921
Wait.
(handcuffs tighten)

685
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:00,860
We will start
by stating our grievances.

686
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:02,094
Who would like
to go first?

687
00:26:02,128 --> 00:26:03,195
She lied and
betrayed me.

688
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:04,096
Next.

689
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:06,866
Brave start, Mazikeen.

690
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:08,200
And you,

691
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:09,902
Doctor?
Well,

692
00:26:09,936 --> 00:26:11,003
no grievances.

693
00:26:11,037 --> 00:26:13,072
Um, Maze is right.

694
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:14,974
I hid the truth,
which was

695
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:16,275
a betrayal of our friendship.

696
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:19,345
And if I could take
it all back, I would.

697
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:20,346
But I can't.

698
00:26:20,379 --> 00:26:24,350
So, all I can do is say...

699
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:26,118
I'm sorry.

700
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,355
And I miss you, Maze.

701
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:31,223
CHARLOTTE:
Thank you,

702
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:34,193
Doctor.
That was really heartfelt.

703
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:36,362
And now is there
anything that...

704
00:26:36,395 --> 00:26:38,831
you'd like to apologize for,
Mazikeen?

705
00:26:38,865 --> 00:26:41,100
She just said she boned my ex.

706
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:42,234
I didn't do
anything.

707
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:45,237
Well, it always takes two
to tango.

708
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:46,639
Yeah, Linda and Amenadiel.

709
00:26:46,673 --> 00:26:48,074
One, two, naked tango.

710
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,642
Me, screwed.

711
00:26:49,676 --> 00:26:51,377
Resolving conflict
means,

712
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:55,047
uh, accepting culpability
on both sides.

713
00:26:55,081 --> 00:26:56,348
If you don't let
all the icky feelings out,

714
00:26:56,382 --> 00:26:59,251
things tend to fester,

715
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:01,253
and turn gangrenous,
and, well...

716
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:03,856
nobody likes losing a limb.

717
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:05,024
Not true.

718
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:06,158
And I didn't do crap.

719
00:27:06,192 --> 00:27:08,294
She called dibs.

720
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:13,032
On someone she doesn't
even have feelings for.

721
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:14,400
I'm a demon, Linda.

722
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:16,068
What do you expect?

723
00:27:16,102 --> 00:27:18,971
You can't admit
to a single thing you did wrong?

724
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:20,072
I've done a lot of things wrong.

725
00:27:20,106 --> 00:27:21,107
Like, a lot.

726
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:24,443
But at least I don't claim
to be the good one.

727
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,046
Pretend to stand
on some moral high ground.

728
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:29,415
You know, despite all
the books you've read,

729
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:31,150
all the degrees on your wall,

730
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:33,385
you forgot the one
rule that matters.

731
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:36,088
Hos before bros.

732
00:27:36,122 --> 00:27:37,957
LINDA: Well, it's pretty
tricky to follow that rule

733
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,893
when you seem to have slept
with, oh, half of Los Angeles.

734
00:27:40,927 --> 00:27:42,294
And yet,
you begrudge me

735
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:44,430
the one man I've cared about

736
00:27:44,463 --> 00:27:45,431
in a really
long time.

737
00:27:45,464 --> 00:27:47,033
And yet,

738
00:27:47,066 --> 00:27:49,936
I still gave him up.

739
00:27:51,938 --> 00:27:54,741
That's how much I care
about our friendship.

740
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:03,449
Go... to... hell.

741
00:28:03,482 --> 00:28:05,217
(gasps)

742
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:07,319
Okay. Great start.

743
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:10,189
Um, all part
of the process.

744
00:28:10,222 --> 00:28:12,391
Good time for a breather?

745
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:13,960
We're done.

746
00:28:14,994 --> 00:28:17,463
(knuckles crack)

747
00:28:17,496 --> 00:28:19,465
(quietly):
Okay.

748
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:23,069
* You know your time has come

749
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,338
* Oh, yeah, your time...

750
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:29,208
What on earth
do you think you're doing?

751
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:31,243
You. Get naked.

752
00:28:31,277 --> 00:28:33,045
I beg your pardon?

753
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:35,982
You said you wanted to focus
your attention on me.

754
00:28:36,015 --> 00:28:37,750
(laughing):
Well, yes, but, uh...

755
00:28:37,784 --> 00:28:39,418
And I always have sex
the night before a show.

756
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:41,954
It... it calms me.

757
00:28:41,988 --> 00:28:44,090
Well, I'm sorry, but you'd have
to tie me down with steel chains

758
00:28:44,123 --> 00:28:45,157
to have sex with you.

759
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:46,759
I'd be up for that.

760
00:28:46,793 --> 00:28:49,161
No! What-- it wasn't
a suggestion!

761
00:28:49,195 --> 00:28:51,230
Demanding. I like it.

762
00:28:51,263 --> 00:28:52,498
Miss Axara.
Uh-huh?

763
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:54,967
I love sex.
What a coincidence. Me, too.

764
00:28:55,001 --> 00:28:57,269
But, and this may be a first...

765
00:28:57,303 --> 00:28:58,470
Okay.

766
00:28:58,504 --> 00:29:01,007
I'm really not in the mood.

767
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,474
* Whoo.

768
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:05,978
You know what?

769
00:29:06,012 --> 00:29:07,279
I don't think you like me.

770
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:08,380
Really?

771
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:10,516
Whatever gave you
that impression?

772
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:13,485
But... but everybody likes me.

773
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:15,087
Apart from the person
who tried to rocket you

774
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:17,123
into a bloody red glare.
Okay.

775
00:29:17,156 --> 00:29:18,991
If you don't like me,
why were you so hell-bent

776
00:29:19,025 --> 00:29:20,092
on being my bodyguard?

777
00:29:20,126 --> 00:29:22,328
(sighs)

778
00:29:22,361 --> 00:29:24,130
Because I'm trying
to take my focus off

779
00:29:24,163 --> 00:29:26,098
someone very dear to me.

780
00:29:26,132 --> 00:29:28,267
But-- a friend, actually.

781
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,302
Well, no, indeed,
more a coworker.

782
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,007
(sighs)

783
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:37,009
Oh.

784
00:29:37,043 --> 00:29:39,411
The detective
you work with?

785
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:41,513
How did you...

786
00:29:41,547 --> 00:29:44,183
I may be a self-centered diva,
but I have eyes.

787
00:29:44,216 --> 00:29:45,384
Why are you trying
to convince yourself

788
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:47,019
that you don't like her?

789
00:29:47,053 --> 00:29:48,354
I'm not trying to convince my...

790
00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:52,091
It's not me
I'm trying to convince.

791
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,425
It's my Father.

792
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,327
I defied Him,

793
00:29:55,361 --> 00:29:59,131
and He's big on that
"eye for an eye" sort of thing.

794
00:29:59,165 --> 00:30:02,234
So I'm afraid that he's gonna
come after...

795
00:30:02,268 --> 00:30:05,137
the things that I care about
the most.

796
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:07,073
Well, you're a cop, sort of.

797
00:30:07,106 --> 00:30:09,075
Get a restraining order
or something.

798
00:30:09,108 --> 00:30:10,242
Well, I'm afraid
it's not that simple.

799
00:30:10,276 --> 00:30:11,510
Dad's all-powerful.

800
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:13,245
Works in government?

801
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:14,446
Mm, rules the universe.

802
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,248
Frickin' politicians.

803
00:30:16,282 --> 00:30:18,450
Well, hey, if it helps,
I know how you feel.

804
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:21,153
After what happened at my show,
it seems like everyone's trying

805
00:30:21,187 --> 00:30:23,455
to take away the thing
I care about the most.

806
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:25,191
What? Fresh turmeric?

807
00:30:25,224 --> 00:30:26,625
(laughs)

808
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,861
Funny. Funny, but no.

809
00:30:28,895 --> 00:30:31,163
Music.

810
00:30:31,197 --> 00:30:32,364
Ah.

811
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:33,632
But here's the deal.

812
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:37,103
You can't let anyone come
in between you

813
00:30:37,136 --> 00:30:40,472
and the things you're passionate
about in this life.

814
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:42,641
Or it ain't worth living.

815
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,176
(chuckles softly)

816
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:47,479
Well. Thank you,
my self-centered diva,

817
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:49,348
for your counsel.

818
00:30:49,381 --> 00:30:51,083
It's duly noted.
(laughs)

819
00:30:51,117 --> 00:30:52,484
Hey, I don't know
about you,

820
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:54,620
but I could use a drink.

821
00:30:54,653 --> 00:30:57,289
Oh, well now you are
talking my language.

822
00:30:57,323 --> 00:30:58,390
(both chuckle)

823
00:30:58,424 --> 00:31:00,192
Long as it's not
orange, right?

824
00:31:00,226 --> 00:31:02,194
(sighs)

825
00:31:02,228 --> 00:31:03,629
(quietly):
Right.

826
00:31:07,133 --> 00:31:08,600
Lovely.

827
00:31:08,634 --> 00:31:11,437
I wasn't sure if you're
a single malt girl...

828
00:31:14,673 --> 00:31:16,142
Bugger.

829
00:31:20,446 --> 00:31:22,181
Epic toxicology report.

830
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:23,916
It turns out the manager
didn't just kill Benny,

831
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:25,517
he tortured him, too.

832
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:27,219
I mean, it's bad enough
that he made him take

833
00:31:27,253 --> 00:31:28,420
all those sleeping pills,
but to force him

834
00:31:28,454 --> 00:31:29,621
to eat all that stuff, too?

835
00:31:29,655 --> 00:31:31,523
I mean, that is just cruel, man.

836
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:33,159
Wait, so what does
this mean here?

837
00:31:33,192 --> 00:31:34,260
Oh, right, sorry, yeah.

838
00:31:34,293 --> 00:31:36,228
It's the chemical compounds.

839
00:31:36,262 --> 00:31:39,498
So first, he fed Benny
raw turmeric.

840
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:41,333
Hmm.
And kale.

841
00:31:41,367 --> 00:31:42,168
A lot of kale.

842
00:31:42,201 --> 00:31:45,237
And then, a boatload
of spirulina.

843
00:31:45,271 --> 00:31:47,673
But this all sounds
like ingredients for a smoothie.

844
00:31:47,706 --> 00:31:49,141
Yeah, smoothie of death.

845
00:31:49,175 --> 00:31:50,009
No, I mean,
the pills.

846
00:31:50,042 --> 00:31:51,343
It could've been blended
into a smoothie

847
00:31:51,377 --> 00:31:52,945
like the one that Axara drinks.

848
00:31:52,979 --> 00:31:54,646
Be a good way
to disguise the taste.

849
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,983
You know what? I don't think
the manager's the killer.

850
00:32:02,221 --> 00:32:04,423
Beard-to-misery quotient.

851
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:06,192
It's a science, man.

852
00:32:06,225 --> 00:32:09,962
After my divorce,
I went for the old Walter White.

853
00:32:09,996 --> 00:32:13,232
Whatever you do,
do not go full Hagrid.

854
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:16,468
Kenny Rogers, tops.

855
00:32:18,004 --> 00:32:19,471
Oh, hey, uh,
a buddy of mine's here.

856
00:32:19,505 --> 00:32:21,607
He's a real "glass half full"
kind of guy.

857
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:26,412
He actually pulled me out
of a dark spot once.

858
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:27,446
Hey.

859
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:29,381
Hey.
(grunts)

860
00:32:29,415 --> 00:32:31,583
Maybe he can help you out.

861
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:33,285
Amenadiel.

862
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:34,353
Pierce.

863
00:32:35,354 --> 00:32:36,722
Or not.

864
00:32:36,755 --> 00:32:38,290
Uh, since you guys

865
00:32:38,324 --> 00:32:40,692
obviously already
know each other,

866
00:32:40,726 --> 00:32:42,594
how about I just give you
some time to catch up? Hmm?

867
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:44,330
Yeah, I saw a food truck

868
00:32:44,363 --> 00:32:46,365
on the way in. I'm just gonna
grab myself a burger.

869
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:47,499
Protein style.

870
00:32:49,235 --> 00:32:50,336
Something... Yeah. Okay.

871
00:32:50,369 --> 00:32:52,304
I'm gonna be back later.

872
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:56,575
I can't allow you
to defy my father

873
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:58,477
or drag my brother
into one of your schemes

874
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,512
to remove your mark.
This ends now.

875
00:33:01,547 --> 00:33:03,449
Okay.

876
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:06,685
Really?
Yeah.

877
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:08,287
Look, I'm way ahead of you.

878
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,688
(chuckles) I got my hopes up

879
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:12,258
thinking that Decker
was the key, and then Lucifer.

880
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:13,359
But that's what
the Sinnerman thought.

881
00:33:13,392 --> 00:33:16,328
Then I thought resurrecting
Abel could end my curse.

882
00:33:16,362 --> 00:33:17,696
But I made a mistake.

883
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:19,498
I was wrong.

884
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:21,233
'Cause here I am,
alive and well.

885
00:33:21,267 --> 00:33:23,235
Well, alive and miserable,
actually.

886
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:24,536
So I'm done.

887
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:26,638
Finito.

888
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:28,340
I quit.

889
00:33:28,374 --> 00:33:29,608
You happy?

890
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:32,044
Yes.

891
00:33:32,078 --> 00:33:33,412
Yes,

892
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:34,346
because this means I did it.

893
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,682
I destroyed your alliance
with Lucifer.

894
00:33:36,715 --> 00:33:38,517
I prevented you
from defying my father.

895
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,552
I passed my test.

896
00:33:40,586 --> 00:33:42,254
If you passed your test,

897
00:33:42,288 --> 00:33:44,256
why don't you have
your wings back?

898
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:46,658
Well, maybe my test
has multiple parts.

899
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:48,260
Um, if so, that's okay.

900
00:33:48,294 --> 00:33:49,361
It's God's will.

901
00:33:49,395 --> 00:33:50,462
Right?
How do you do that?

902
00:33:50,496 --> 00:33:52,264
How do you stay so positive?

903
00:33:52,298 --> 00:33:54,266
It's called faith, Pierce.

904
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,434
(chuckles)

905
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:57,536
See, I spent a lot of time
doubting myself,

906
00:33:57,569 --> 00:33:59,605
but now I realize
that it's about the journey,

907
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:01,540
not the destination.

908
00:34:01,573 --> 00:34:03,475
How could you possibly have
any faith or hope

909
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:05,777
when you're in a loop
of endless suffering?

910
00:34:05,811 --> 00:34:08,580
(piano playing)

911
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:17,389
* At first I was afraid

912
00:34:17,423 --> 00:34:20,326
* I was petrified

913
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:23,295
* Kept thinking
I could never live *

914
00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:25,831
* Without you by my side

915
00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:29,401
* Then I spent so many nights
Bloody hell.

916
00:34:29,435 --> 00:34:30,836
* Thinking how you
did me wrong... *

917
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:33,372
Isn't she supposed
to be on lockdown?
Uh...

918
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:35,807
I'm calling Chloe.
No! No, I mean,

919
00:34:35,841 --> 00:34:37,509
no need to get the
detective involved.

920
00:34:37,543 --> 00:34:38,477
I've got this.

921
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:41,713
* And now you're back
from outer space *

922
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:44,850
* I just walked in
to find you here *

923
00:34:44,883 --> 00:34:46,718
* With that sad look
across your face *
(mutters)

924
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:48,320
* I should have changed
that stupid lock... *

925
00:34:48,354 --> 00:34:49,388
Go back upstairs.

926
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:50,822
You're in danger.

927
00:34:50,856 --> 00:34:54,326
Give me the microphone.
Give me the microphone.

928
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,462
Go on, now, go.

929
00:34:56,495 --> 00:34:58,430
* Walk out the door

930
00:34:58,464 --> 00:35:00,132
* Just turn around now

931
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:02,601
* 'Cause you're not
welcome anymore *

932
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:05,337
* Weren't you the one
who tried to hurt me *

933
00:35:05,371 --> 00:35:06,338
* With good-bye...

934
00:35:06,372 --> 00:35:07,806
Did you think
I'd crumble, hmm?

935
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,641
* Did you think I'd lay down
and die? *

936
00:35:09,675 --> 00:35:11,710
BOTH:
* Oh, no, not I

937
00:35:11,743 --> 00:35:14,646
* I will survive

938
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,682
* Oh, as long as I know
how to love *

939
00:35:16,715 --> 00:35:18,417
* I know I'm still alive

940
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,452
* I've got all my life to live

941
00:35:20,486 --> 00:35:21,887
* And I've got all my love
to give *

942
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,722
* And I'll survive

943
00:35:23,755 --> 00:35:26,158
BOTH:
* I will survive

944
00:35:26,192 --> 00:35:27,459
* Hey, hey, hey...

945
00:35:27,493 --> 00:35:29,795
Give me the microphone.

946
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:31,763
(audience cheering)

947
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:34,666
* 'Cause you're not
welcome anymore *

948
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:38,170
* Weren't you the one who tried
to break me with good-bye? *

949
00:35:38,204 --> 00:35:39,671
* Think I'd crumble?

950
00:35:39,705 --> 00:35:41,773
BOTH: * Did you think
I'd lay down and die? *

951
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:44,176
* Oh, no, not I

952
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:45,544
* I will survive

953
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:48,580
* Oh, as long as I know
how to love *

954
00:35:48,614 --> 00:35:49,781
* I know I'll stay alive

955
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:51,783
* I've got all my life to live

956
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:53,652
* I've got all my love to give

957
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:55,721
* And I'll survive

958
00:35:55,754 --> 00:35:59,491
* I will survive

959
00:35:59,525 --> 00:36:02,594
* Hey, hey.

960
00:36:02,628 --> 00:36:05,597
(sighs) See?

961
00:36:05,631 --> 00:36:07,433
How could I
ever leave this?

962
00:36:07,466 --> 00:36:09,468
No one's ever gonna scare
me out of the spotlight.

963
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:10,802
Ever.

964
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:12,804
Yeah? Try me.
Come on.

965
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:13,872
(scoffs)

966
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:14,706
You.

967
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:20,879
You were supposed
to keep her safe.

968
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:24,516
No offense, darling, but
you're the one with a knife.

969
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,559
AXARA: What's with
the knife, Cece?

970
00:36:33,592 --> 00:36:34,560
You're gonna hurt someone.

971
00:36:34,593 --> 00:36:35,461
Does it even matter?

972
00:36:35,494 --> 00:36:37,963
Two people are dead,
you were shot at,

973
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:40,732
and you still won't stop.

974
00:36:40,766 --> 00:36:42,968
Don't you see the danger
you're in?

975
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:46,538
Again, am I the only one
who sees the irony here?

976
00:36:46,572 --> 00:36:48,440
You said you would take a break
after the L.A. shows

977
00:36:48,474 --> 00:36:49,975
and then you added Asia
and Europe to the tour.

978
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:51,443
That's two more years.

979
00:36:51,477 --> 00:36:52,644
So?
CECE:
So?!

980
00:36:52,678 --> 00:36:54,646
That's two more years now.

981
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,647
And then another two
and another two.

982
00:36:55,681 --> 00:36:56,648
When does it end?

983
00:36:56,682 --> 00:36:57,849
Never.

984
00:36:57,883 --> 00:36:59,017
Hopefully.

985
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:02,588
I am tired of sharing you,
Axara.

986
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:05,557
Remember high school?

987
00:37:05,591 --> 00:37:07,859
Before all of this.

988
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:12,464
It was just you and me,
singing along to Beyoncé.

989
00:37:12,498 --> 00:37:14,666
Well, you would sing,

990
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,303
I-I would just watch
and eat cookie dough.

991
00:37:19,305 --> 00:37:21,239
I want that.

992
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:25,243
You have to know by now.

993
00:37:27,045 --> 00:37:28,780
I love you.

994
00:37:28,814 --> 00:37:30,282
Love me?

995
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:34,753
Oh, my God, Cece,
what did you do?

996
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:35,854
She was trying to protect you.

997
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:39,024
Force you out of the spotlight
by any means necessary.

998
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:40,025
Even murder?

999
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:42,494
I-I didn't know what else to do.

1000
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:44,496
You almost killed me.
How is that protecting me?

1001
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:45,697
She was never trying
to kill you.

1002
00:37:45,731 --> 00:37:47,666
Oh, what is she doing here?

1003
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:48,700
CHLOE: Cece ran
your social media.

1004
00:37:48,734 --> 00:37:51,770
It was easy for her
to start an account as you

1005
00:37:51,803 --> 00:37:53,605
and access all of
your private texts.

1006
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:55,307
So you knew about
the choreography switch.

1007
00:37:55,341 --> 00:37:57,709
I just wanted to scare you.

1008
00:37:57,743 --> 00:37:59,778
I'm never gonna stop singing,
Cece.

1009
00:37:59,811 --> 00:38:01,713
Not even for me?

1010
00:38:01,747 --> 00:38:03,849
My music means more to me
than anything.

1011
00:38:06,652 --> 00:38:08,554
You have to know that by now.

1012
00:38:11,557 --> 00:38:14,526
Drop the knife,
Cece, it's over.

1013
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,827
(sobbing):
No.

1014
00:38:15,861 --> 00:38:17,829
No!

1015
00:38:17,863 --> 00:38:19,665
No!
(audience gasps, screams)

1016
00:38:21,767 --> 00:38:24,069
I just wanted her
to be safe.

1017
00:38:24,102 --> 00:38:25,837
I know you did.

1018
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:35,814
Well, who's the heroic one, now?

1019
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:36,782
(chuckles)

1020
00:38:38,684 --> 00:38:40,952
What?
Oh, my God.
Lucifer, are you okay?

1021
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:43,555
Why wouldn't I be okay?

1022
00:38:43,589 --> 00:38:44,456
Oh.

1023
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:46,592
Oh, God, whatever you do,
don't pull it...

1024
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:48,827
(grunts)
...out!

1025
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,962
(chuckles weakly)
Oops.

1026
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:53,632
(grunts)

1027
00:38:55,801 --> 00:38:56,935
What were you thinking,

1028
00:38:56,968 --> 00:38:58,937
tackling somebody with a knife?

1029
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:01,640
It's not me I was worried about,
Detective.

1030
00:39:05,711 --> 00:39:07,846
Lucifer.

1031
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:12,117
You see, it's like
I was saying, Pierce.

1032
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:17,122
You got to have faith
because life can surprise you.

1033
00:39:17,155 --> 00:39:19,057
Now, if my brother,

1034
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,960
the Devil, can have that...

1035
00:39:21,993 --> 00:39:24,696
(sighs)
Maybe I can, too.

1036
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:26,398
God.

1037
00:39:33,739 --> 00:39:37,709
Hey, look at you, buddy.

1038
00:39:37,743 --> 00:39:39,377
Seems like someone's
feeling better.

1039
00:39:41,179 --> 00:39:43,014
Okay.

1040
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:46,151
PIERCE:
Hi.

1041
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:47,919
Lieutenant.

1042
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,624
Congratulations
on another solve.

1043
00:39:52,658 --> 00:39:54,626
Thank you.

1044
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,027
Thanks, I appreciate that.

1045
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:57,929
I'm just glad
Axara's okay.

1046
00:39:57,963 --> 00:40:00,432
Well, I guess more than okay.
Her show's back on for the night

1047
00:40:00,466 --> 00:40:05,036
and she sent me two VIP tickets
to say thank you.

1048
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,037
Well, you deserve them.

1049
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:07,439
So, who are you taking?

1050
00:40:07,473 --> 00:40:10,776
Oh, I don't know.
It's just...

1051
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:11,843
I thought you'd never ask.

1052
00:40:11,877 --> 00:40:12,911
Oh.

1053
00:40:12,944 --> 00:40:14,045
Yeah.

1054
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,747
Sure. Yeah, why not?

1055
00:40:15,781 --> 00:40:17,749
Great, I'll see you later.
Okay.

1056
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:24,055
LUCIFER:
Morning, Detective.

1057
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:25,857
What?
What?

1058
00:40:25,891 --> 00:40:28,126
You sure you don't want
to throw a surprise party

1059
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:30,195
for the guy in evidence lockup?

1060
00:40:30,228 --> 00:40:31,863
(chuckles)

1061
00:40:31,897 --> 00:40:34,065
Ah, right, yes, I suppose
I deserve that.

1062
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:36,968
No, no, I am back
to status quo.

1063
00:40:37,002 --> 00:40:38,837
Hmm.
Since I realized,

1064
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:41,773
ultimately, I can't control you

1065
00:40:41,807 --> 00:40:43,174
or the world around you,
for that matter.

1066
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:45,176
So there's no point
trying to extinguish

1067
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:47,813
the proverbial spotlight,
is there?

1068
00:40:47,846 --> 00:40:50,181
I may just have to take a knife
to the chest every now and then.

1069
00:40:50,215 --> 00:40:51,983
(chuckles)
Right.

1070
00:40:52,017 --> 00:40:54,886
Hello.

1071
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,955
Tickets for Axara's
show. Tonight?

1072
00:40:56,988 --> 00:40:58,790
Excellent.

1073
00:40:58,824 --> 00:40:59,958
Right, what time
shall I pick you up?

1074
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:02,861
Um...

1075
00:41:02,894 --> 00:41:04,162
Well...

1076
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:07,499
it didn't seem like
you were that interested

1077
00:41:07,533 --> 00:41:09,100
in hanging out
with me lately,

1078
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:11,102
so Pierce and I
are gonna go together.

1079
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:14,239
Oh. Right, yeah, of course.

1080
00:41:14,272 --> 00:41:16,107
(laughing):
Of course. Well...

1081
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:18,109
have fun.

1082
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:19,978
I've heard she's amazing live.

1083
00:41:20,011 --> 00:41:21,179
* Da, da, da, da, da

1084
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:23,982
Uh...

1085
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:26,117
* Da, da, da

1086
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:28,153
* Da, da, da, da, da

1087
00:41:32,257 --> 00:41:34,926
* Well, I woke up

1088
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,029
* Tossing and turning

1089
00:41:38,063 --> 00:41:43,735
* An unfamiliar fire's
been burning *

1090
00:41:43,769 --> 00:41:47,138
* And I don't know

1091
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:49,841
* How to feel

1092
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:53,044
* I'm not used to real

1093
00:41:53,078 --> 00:41:56,848
* It's too real

1094
00:41:56,882 --> 00:42:01,219
* For more than two years
I've been lonely *

1095
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:05,223
* And then you came around

1096
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:07,158
* Ever so slowly

1097
00:42:07,192 --> 00:42:11,229
* When I needed it most

1098
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:13,298
* You just hold me

1099
00:42:13,331 --> 00:42:17,035
* And then you'd unfold me

1100
00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:20,171
* Every layer

1101
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:23,241
* I don't want to run from it

1102
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:25,844
* This is the happiest
I've ever been *

1103
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:29,247
* I'd rather escape
with these memories *

1104
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,918
* Than worry about losing you

1105
00:42:32,951 --> 00:42:37,989
* No reg, no reg, no reg,
no regular love *

1106
00:42:38,023 --> 00:42:40,792
* No reg, no reg, no reg

1107
00:42:40,826 --> 00:42:45,063
* No regular love

1108
00:42:45,096 --> 00:42:47,132
* No reg, no reg

1109
00:42:47,165 --> 00:42:51,002
* No regular love

1110
00:42:51,036 --> 00:42:53,204
* No reg, no reg

1111
00:42:53,238 --> 00:42:57,008
* No regular love

1112
00:42:57,042 --> 00:42:59,377
* Da, da, da, da, da

1113
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,212
* Da, da, da *

1114
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:02,280
* Da, da, da, da, da

1115
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:04,115
* Da, da, da *

1116
00:43:04,149 --> 00:43:06,985
* Da, da, da, da, da,
da, da, da, da, da... *

1117
00:43:07,018 --> 00:43:10,188
I think I've made
a horrible mistake.

1118
00:43:10,221 --> 00:43:14,860
* No reg, no reg,
no regular love. *
