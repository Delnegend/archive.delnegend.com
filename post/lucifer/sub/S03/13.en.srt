00:00:02,103 --> 00:00:02,770
Previously on Lucifer...
CHLOE: Hey, Lieutenant,

2
00:00:02,803 --> 00:00:03,337
are you going somewhere?

3
00:00:03,371 --> 00:00:05,506
I put in for a transfer.

4
00:00:05,539 --> 00:00:07,041
Maybe you don't have to go.

5
00:00:07,075 --> 00:00:08,008
As a thank you
for watching Trixie,

6
00:00:08,042 --> 00:00:09,143
maybe we can go grab
that coffee sometime.

7
00:00:09,177 --> 00:00:11,712
Dinner would be
more romantic.

8
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:13,547
(Charlotte chuckles)

9
00:00:13,581 --> 00:00:17,251
Did you know that Linda
and Amenadiel are a thing?

10
00:00:17,285 --> 00:00:19,120
So our old flames
are having a fling.

11
00:00:19,153 --> 00:00:20,454
I don't care,
why should you?

12
00:00:20,488 --> 00:00:23,391
Unless you're still
hot for angel.

13
00:00:23,424 --> 00:00:25,359
No!

14
00:00:25,393 --> 00:00:27,461
LUCIFER:
You know, for an immortal,

15
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:29,363
you really do bleed a lot,
don't you?

16
00:00:29,397 --> 00:00:30,831
I'm still human.
I still feel

17
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,733
all the pain
that comes with death.

18
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,135
It's just the wounds heal.

19
00:00:34,168 --> 00:00:35,836
Do your thing. Ask me.

20
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,271
Kane.

21
00:00:37,305 --> 00:00:39,473
What is it that
you desire?

22
00:00:39,507 --> 00:00:40,441
To die.

23
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:42,843
I will find a way to end
your infinite misery

24
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,645
if it's the last thing I do.

25
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:49,217
(elevator bell dings)

26
00:00:51,452 --> 00:00:52,520
Lucifer?

27
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,256
Lucifer!

28
00:00:57,158 --> 00:00:59,160
Hello, Lucifer?

29
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:02,096
(chain saw whirring)

30
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,137
If it were that easy to kill me,

31
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,071
I would have been dead
a long time ago.

32
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:15,676
Very well.

33
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:18,879
Right, have you tried...

34
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,714
grenade down the throat?
Yes.

35
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:23,284
Acid bath?
Mm-hmm.

36
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:25,453
(sighs) Devoured by wolves?

37
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:26,154
Yes.

38
00:01:26,187 --> 00:01:27,455
Dropped into helicopter blades?

39
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:28,189
Mm-hmm.

40
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:30,658
I've been trying
to kill myself

41
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:31,892
since the Bronze Age.

42
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,461
I have tried

43
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:34,862
everything.

44
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:36,430
Even jumped into a volcano once.

45
00:01:36,464 --> 00:01:38,532
What, you survived molten lava?

46
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:41,335
Yeah, it was a rough six months.
Just, whatever I do, I just...

47
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:43,671
regrow.

48
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:46,340
Huh, like a blue-eyed,
square-jawed tapeworm.

49
00:01:46,374 --> 00:01:49,477
So if I cut you exactly in half,
would there be two Pierces?

50
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,845
No. Only one side would heal.

51
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,647
You see, I call it the,
the "master molecule" theory.

52
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:55,749
Yes, yes, Wolverine rules.
I get it.

53
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:57,218
But...

54
00:01:57,251 --> 00:01:59,220
there must be some
method that works.

55
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:02,490
Lucifer, why do you care
so much about this?

56
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:04,892
Because my Father laid a curse
on you to live forever,

57
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:08,729
so killing you would be an epic
loogie in the old man's eye.

58
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:09,897
Well, you are the Devil.

59
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,632
You must have something
shockingly evil

60
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:12,766
up your sleeve.

61
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,236
Mm, you mean, uh...

62
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:16,837
something like this?
Aah!

63
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,539
Ouch!

64
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:19,840
Thanks.

65
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,108
You're most welcome.

66
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:25,479
'Cause that little bad boy was
forged in the bowels of Hell.

67
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:27,648
(groaning)

68
00:02:29,417 --> 00:02:31,885
Oh, yes, demon steel.

69
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:34,555
Can kill even me, so...

70
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:37,758
time to say good-bye
to Hollywood, Pierce.

71
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:41,795
Good-bye, Lucifer.

72
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:44,398
No, I-I don't understand.
How does this not work?

73
00:02:44,432 --> 00:02:45,433
I should have known

74
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:47,801
that you wouldn't be able
to figure this out.

75
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,270
Well, I mean,
the good news is

76
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:51,372
we've got all the time
in the world to do so.

77
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:54,542
For me, that's a bad thing.

78
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:55,709
(groans)

79
00:02:55,743 --> 00:02:58,379
(siren chirps)
* We gonna make it
to the morning *

80
00:02:58,412 --> 00:03:01,482
* We gonna make it to morning

81
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:04,285
* We gonna make it
to the morning *

82
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:07,888
* We gonna make it to morning.

83
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,290
Hey, Dan.

84
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:10,824
Hey.
Thank you.

85
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:13,994
I feel like I'm having déjà vu.
This street seems so familiar.

86
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,128
Yeah, well, it should.

87
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:17,465
We took a look at that house
right there on the corner.

88
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:18,632
Remember? Right after
Trixie was born.

89
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:22,803
Oh, yeah. Great public schools,
really safe neighborhood.

90
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:25,973
Oh... or not.

91
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:27,575
June Lee, 34.

92
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:29,743
Local chemistry teacher.
She lived right down the block.

93
00:03:29,777 --> 00:03:32,012
Forestry service left the
wood chipper here overnight,

94
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,715
and someone took advantage.

95
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:35,949
(sighs)

96
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:38,719
Did you get a chance to talk
to any of the lookie-loos yet?

97
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:39,787
Nope.

98
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,821
All yours.

99
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:42,022
Okay.

100
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,691
Hello.

101
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,559
I'm Detective Decker.

102
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:46,960
Who would do this to poor June?

103
00:03:46,994 --> 00:03:50,331
Well, I'm hoping that you all
could help me with that.

104
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:52,433
Um... did any of you hear

105
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:55,669
or see anything out of
the ordinary this morning?

106
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:58,606
No. I mean, I heard that
wood chipper going, but...

107
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,707
I didn't know.

108
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,041
And did any of
you know anyone

109
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,610
that would want to hurt June?

110
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:03,811
No.

111
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:05,846
Everyone really loved her.

112
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,449
She was very active
in the community.

113
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:11,552
We just got mani-pedis together.

114
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:14,254
Mm, sorry.

115
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:21,862
Ah, thank you
for your help, Maze.

116
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:22,796
No worries.

117
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,832
This actually gives me
time to brainstorm

118
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:26,500
a little problem of my own.

119
00:04:26,534 --> 00:04:27,335
Ah.

120
00:04:27,368 --> 00:04:29,703
So, this is for
anything with wings.

121
00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:31,705
Ooh.
I grab them like this.

122
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:34,675
And then I stab 'em
with my blade.

123
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,377
Right.

124
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,078
This beauty... (laughs)

125
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,914
This is for anything with horns.

126
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:41,915
Oh, goody.

127
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,651
So I hook 'em like this.
Yeah.

128
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:45,586
And then, bam!

129
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:48,389
Blade straight to the heart.

130
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:49,923
Right, I'm just
gonna stop you there.

131
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:51,091
Do these grisly struggles

132
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,894
always end with you stabbing
a victim with your blade?

133
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:55,463
My blades were forged in Hell.

134
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:57,865
How else am I supposed to kill
a celestial being?

135
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:00,634
Damn. I already stabbed him
with one of your blades.

136
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:03,404
Well, I wish you
would've told me that

137
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:05,706
before I hauled all this
out of the basement.

138
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:06,907
Nothing on Earth.

139
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,809
Nothing from Hell.

140
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:11,679
I mean, there must be some
way to snuff this candle.

141
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:12,413
Well...

142
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:15,549
Decker makes you
killable, right?

143
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:16,617
Hmm.
Why don't you

144
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,851
see what's going on there?

145
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,821
Rub some of that on Pierce.

146
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:22,089
Apples to oranges, Maze.

147
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:23,424
What's going on there

148
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:25,759
is just a cruel joke from Dad.

149
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:27,961
(laughing): And what's
going on with Pierce isn't?

150
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:28,962
Your Father

151
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:31,665
is all about mind games
and loopholes, remember?

152
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:34,735
Yes, perhaps you're right, Maze.

153
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,972
Maybe I should find out
what makes Pierce vulnerable.

154
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:40,340
Get inside his head.

155
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:43,444
Not with the cranial saw.

156
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:44,845
Well, not yet

157
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:46,146
anyway.

158
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,748
(chuckles)

159
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:49,950
*

160
00:05:59,727 --> 00:06:01,962
Why is my couch in
the middle of my office?

161
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:03,564
Oh, good. You're here.

162
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:04,665
Please, take a seat.

163
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,834
How are you feeling today?

164
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:07,835
What are you doing?

165
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,504
Oh, answering a question
with another question.

166
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:12,105
That's called "evasion."

167
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:13,741
All right,

168
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:15,576
and your body language
suggests you're quite upset.

169
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:17,778
No, I'm just not a fan
of your redecorating.

170
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:19,012
That's awfully
passive-aggressive

171
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:22,082
of you, Pierce. Why don't you
tell me how you really feel?

172
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,584
Get out of my office.

173
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:24,852
Good, good. Anger.

174
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,920
That's called a breakthrough,
yeah.

175
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:29,490
Oh. Don't worry.

176
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:30,924
This is a safe place.

177
00:06:34,662 --> 00:06:35,629
Why are you doing this?

178
00:06:35,663 --> 00:06:36,530
Well, how am I supposed

179
00:06:36,564 --> 00:06:38,732
to solve the mystery
of how to kill you

180
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:40,868
if I don't understand you first?

181
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,970
Your strengths,
your weaknesses.

182
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:44,938
Because everyone has
a Kryptonite, Lieutenant.

183
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:50,911
So in other words, you still
have no idea how to kill me?

184
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:53,213
But... this is the idea.

185
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:56,450
I'm not a crier.

186
00:06:56,484 --> 00:06:57,451
I'm not a sharer.

187
00:06:57,485 --> 00:07:00,187
So unless you have something
that's case-related,

188
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,955
we're done talking.

189
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,626
And turn my desk around.

190
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:08,428
Decker.

191
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:09,663
Please tell me
you're working

192
00:07:09,697 --> 00:07:11,131
on something interesting.

193
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:12,666
Pierce.

194
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,134
Lieutenant, you're still here.

195
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,202
D-Does that mean

196
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:17,137
you've decided to stay, or...?

197
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,138
Yeah.

198
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:19,139
At least for now.

199
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:20,207
Oh, that's great.

200
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,942
That's really, really great.

201
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:23,511
Two really's? Really?

202
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:24,645
Yeah, just 'cause...

203
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:27,247
I have a twist in my case,
and I could use your help.

204
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,617
So the suburban
wood chipper victim,

205
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,151
we recovered a finger,
ran a print.

206
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:33,521
Turns out June Lee
isn't June Lee.

207
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:35,523
It's a false identity?

208
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:36,690
Our vic's real name
is Sandra Jang,

209
00:07:36,724 --> 00:07:39,159
and according to public record,
she died three years ago.

210
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:41,962
Fascinating. You know,

211
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:44,698
the lieutenant has a lot
of experience in fake deaths.

212
00:07:44,732 --> 00:07:46,266
You must mean because
I came up through

213
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,735
Missing Persons in Chicago.

214
00:07:47,768 --> 00:07:48,435
Hmm.

215
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,570
Oh, great. We could
really use

216
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:50,871
your experience on this, then.

217
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:52,706
Yes, I, too, would love
to learn everything

218
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,107
about your experience.

219
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,208
Sure.

220
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:57,110
Decker, why don't
you pull

221
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,912
the original death certificate.
There might be something there.

222
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:00,013
You got it.

223
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,883
I know what you're trying to do.

224
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,818
If you mean solve
a mystery, then yes.

225
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:06,854
And with you and I working
on this case together,

226
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:08,722
it'll kill two mysteries
with one stone, hmm?

227
00:08:08,756 --> 00:08:11,191
Emphasis on the
kill, of course.

228
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,193
Oh...

229
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:15,529
*

230
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:26,640
So if we can figure out why

231
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:28,275
Sandra faked her death
three years ago,

232
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:29,743
it might point to her killer.

233
00:08:29,777 --> 00:08:31,679
In my experience, people
who fake their own death

234
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:33,914
are running from
something or someone.

235
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:37,117
Right, something or someone
that scares them,

236
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,251
makes them feel vulnerable.

237
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:41,855
Any experience of that in
your own life, Lieutenant?

238
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:43,824
Sandra definitely
could've been running.

239
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,325
Check her rap sheet.
Possession of narcotics

240
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,994
and distribution.

241
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:47,861
Mm-hmm.

242
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:49,329
For a gang called
the Korean Power.

243
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,098
Oh, not your
typical gangbanger.

244
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:53,300
DAN: Uh, that's 'cause
she's not a gangbanger.

245
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,334
She's some kind
of a chemist.

246
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,936
Tech unlocked Sandra's laptop,

247
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:58,639
found, uh, recipes for
synthetic chemical compounds

248
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:00,674
all filed under
the label "KPOP."

249
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:01,675
It's a kind of music,

250
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:02,843
right?
Oh, dear.

251
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,245
Poor Daniel,
so behind the times.

252
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:06,346
K-Pop is a kind of Ecstasy.

253
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,815
It's one of the
best kinds, actually.

254
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:10,050
(exhales)

255
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,952
Wait, so Sandra wasn't

256
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:14,888
dealing for the gang,
she was cooking for them.

257
00:09:14,922 --> 00:09:16,957
I wonder if K-Pop
is still on the market?

258
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:20,127
Oh, well, it was
as of last Tuesday.

259
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,762
(laughs)
It's wonderful stuff.

260
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:24,665
Yeah, it makes your skin feel
like a baby chinchilla.

261
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:26,800
And as a nightclub owner,

262
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:29,903
you might know where
to find some?

263
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:31,805
Oh, absolutely. Yes, and I'd
be happy to guide you

264
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:32,806
on your roll, Detective.

265
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,207
Though I would wait
till you have

266
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,275
a day off to recover.

267
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:36,610
I'm not...

268
00:09:36,644 --> 00:09:37,811
You want to squeeze a dealer.

269
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:39,813
Right, and work our way up
the chain to the Korean Power,

270
00:09:39,847 --> 00:09:40,814
maybe find Sandra's killer.

271
00:09:40,848 --> 00:09:43,817
There are dozens of homicides
tied to the gang.

272
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:45,118
Okay, one Ecstasy dealer
coming right up.

273
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:47,320
You two can meet me
at Lux in an hour.

274
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:48,889
Sure.
Right. Daniel?

275
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,724
Yeah?
You can stay.

276
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,728
(siren wailing in distance)

277
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:57,898
Oh, here's one.

278
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,000
Some idiot named Ben Simpson.

279
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:02,703
Absconded in a stolen
ice cream truck.

280
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:04,204
Six-five.
Aggravated assault

281
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:06,173
with a blowtorch. Snore.

282
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:09,009
Don't you clowns have
anything challenging?

283
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,313
What is that?
(sniffs)

284
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,983
Do you smell that?

285
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:17,217
Axe Body Spray.

286
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:19,887
(scoffs)

287
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:27,861
Oh, hello. Uh, do I know you?

288
00:10:27,895 --> 00:10:29,730
Used to.

289
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:32,399
I'm Lucifer's... friend.

290
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:35,102
Oh, so... we're friends?

291
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,871
(laughs) Hell no.

292
00:10:37,905 --> 00:10:39,039
You were a monstrous bitch

293
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:41,809
and I hated you.
We were mortal enemies.

294
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:44,978
Right. I get that a lot.

295
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:48,916
Yeah, but now
something's different.

296
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:51,118
It's...

297
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,086
wonderful.

298
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,723
And Lord knows
I could use a distraction.

299
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:58,992
Oh, well, I have been
trying to make changes.

300
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:01,795
You know, new leaf and all.

301
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:03,764
Hasn't been easy,

302
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:06,466
but I'm glad
it's finally starting to...

303
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,268
come through.

304
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:10,170
Oh, something's coming
through all right.

305
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:13,240
(sniffs)

306
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:15,475
Oh.

307
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,277
You smell incredible.

308
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:20,113
(laughs)

309
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:24,284
What, um, exactly did you say
our relationship was?

310
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:26,954
Shh. Don't talk.

311
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:31,124
I've got to go
hog-tie a fugitive

312
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:33,026
in an ice cream
truck right now.

313
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:38,498
But... I will
definitely be back.

314
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,468
* Ooh, ah

315
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:43,403
* Ooh, ooh

316
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,739
* Ooh, ah

317
00:11:45,773 --> 00:11:47,474
* Ooh, ooh

318
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:51,945
* Don't wanna hide

319
00:11:51,979 --> 00:11:56,817
* Better start running...

320
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,218
Where's Pierce?

321
00:11:58,251 --> 00:11:59,186
He said he was coming.

322
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,288
Well, he's probably
busy at the precinct.

323
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:02,522
And if you're worried

324
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,758
about him being checked out,
relax.

325
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:06,860
He's sticking around L.A.
for a while.

326
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:08,495
I kind of convinced him to stay.

327
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:09,296
Oh, don't be foolish.

328
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:11,064
The man's clearly staying
for me.

329
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:13,233
Turns out we have
quite a bit in common.

330
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:16,069
Right. So, back to reality,
where we have a case to solve,

331
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:17,504
where is this dealer
you promised?

332
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:19,239
Two house specials, please.

333
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:21,008
Lucifer, you know I don't drink
on the job.

334
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,510
Here you go. Two
house specials.

335
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:26,847
* Will I survive?

336
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,149
(under breath):
Your bartender is a drug dealer?

337
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:31,551
What, you think I hired him
for abs alone? (chuckles)

338
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,619
Where'd you get
the K-Pop?

339
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:34,855
* What you're saying
when you fall asleep... *

340
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:37,224
I get it from
the Korean Power.

341
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,359
Best "E" in town,
or used to be.

342
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:40,460
Sad but true.

343
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:42,262
Previously hangover free,
but now in the morning,

344
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:44,564
your mouth's like
Gandhi's flip-flop.

345
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,366
Hmm, what changed?

346
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,434
Their cook.

347
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:49,136
The gang used to have
some genius lady chemist,

348
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:50,203
but I heard she got greedy.

349
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:53,006
She stole
from the Korean Power?
Yup.

350
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,275
Big, powerful,
scary, boss dude,

351
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:57,544
and she pilfered right
from under his nose.

352
00:12:57,577 --> 00:12:58,578
Huh.
(bartender chuckles)

353
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,213
Pretty ballsy.

354
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:02,049
I mean, not that
I would ever...

355
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:03,016
Yes, yes, get on with it.

356
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,217
So, the boss put a hit
out on her, did he?

357
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:06,887
Yeah, but her lab blew up
before they could get to her.

358
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,121
Freak accident.

359
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:09,222
Accident?

360
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:12,960
Do you know this boss' name
or where we can find him?

361
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:14,227
Yeah. Brandon Hong.

362
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:16,396
He likes to hang out at
this one karaoke spot

363
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:17,898
over on Irolo.

364
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:19,332
But these guys
don't mess around.

365
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:21,568
Right, well, mmm...

366
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:23,103
off we go, Detective.

367
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,972
What? Off we go to where?

368
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:27,007
To the karaoke parlor,
talk to a gang leader.

369
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,976
Maybe do a duet if you're
feeling adventurous.

370
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:31,144
We have to verify this testimony
with Vice.

371
00:13:31,178 --> 00:13:32,379
We have to get a warrant,

372
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:33,981
assemble a SWAT team.

373
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:36,083
You know, actually plan
to do a gang takedown.

374
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:37,150
Right. Is that
the sort of thing

375
00:13:37,184 --> 00:13:38,418
the lieutenant
would get involved in?

376
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:41,154
No, Pierce will not get involved
until we bring him a suspect.

377
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:42,622
Which is why we should
just go to the parlor

378
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,157
and skip to that part.

379
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:45,392
Lucifer, this is a
ruthless drug lord

380
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:47,360
with who knows how
many armed thugs?

381
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:49,963
You can't just walk in there
with your three-piece suit

382
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:52,599
and say... (British accent):
"Hello, drug dealers."

383
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:55,235
I would never do that.

384
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:03,010
(speaks Korean)

385
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:05,345
Come out, come out
wherever you are.

386
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:07,314
(gun cocks)

387
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,922
And who are you?
I'm Lucifer.

388
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:16,489
Morningstar. But don't worry,
I'm here alone.

389
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:19,192
The police raid won't happen
for a few more hours.
Police raid?

390
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:22,095
Yes. So as you can see,
I'm in a bit of a rush.

391
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:23,630
Could you point me
to the bigger gun?

392
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:25,165
Your boss?
Get rid of him.

393
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,534
What is it with people
trying to avoid me today?

394
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:29,102
("Lucifer" by SHINee playing)

395
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:31,238
(singing in Korean)

396
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:34,007
(grunting)

397
00:14:39,146 --> 00:14:42,115
* Lucifer...
(singing in Korean)

398
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:44,451
* Lucifer...

399
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,019
(singing in Korean)

400
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,121
(man shouts)

401
00:14:48,155 --> 00:14:50,958
(grunting, screaming)

402
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:56,997
* More than a feeling

403
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,999
(all exclaim)
* More than a feel...

404
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:01,334
("Lucifer" continues playing)
(grunting)

405
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:25,692
* Lucifer.

406
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:28,261
I'm only trying to help.
Help?

407
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,166
Who?!
You. The lieutenant.

408
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,734
I'm a giver, damn it.

409
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,636
And now you

410
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,505
are gonna help me.

411
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:44,044
(chuckles)
CHLOE:
Mr. Hong, thank
you for coming in.

412
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:47,347
So, out-out of curiosity,
what... how did you know

413
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,748
that we wanted
to speak to you?

414
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,750
Ah, when you're
in my line of work,

415
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,186
word gets around, you know?

416
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,421
And what line
of work is that?

417
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,488
Oh.

418
00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:57,124
I run the Korean Power.

419
00:15:57,157 --> 00:16:00,727
Ah.
Uh, we are
a criminal organization

420
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,231
specializing in extortion
and drug dealing.

421
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:05,298
And, yes.

422
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:08,068
Sandra Jang used
to cook our Ecstasy.

423
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:11,771
Oh. And while you're
being so forthcoming

424
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,074
about your felony
distribution,

425
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:16,076
you care to
confess to murder?

426
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:18,278
(chuckles)
I'd love to help you,

427
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,413
but Sandra's death
wasn't our doing.

428
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:21,481
LUCIFER: What, even though
she stole from you

429
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:23,350
and faked her own
death to escape?

430
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:25,218
Yeah, she was
a smart cookie.

431
00:16:25,252 --> 00:16:26,719
I totally fell
for the old

432
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:29,222
my-lab-exploded-
and-I-died schtick.

433
00:16:29,256 --> 00:16:31,158
(chuckles)
But then,

434
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:34,327
like a voice from beyond,
she called me.

435
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:36,496
Sandra stole money from
you to start a new life.

436
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:39,699
Why would she get back
in contact with you?

437
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:42,102
To pay the money back,
with interest.

438
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:44,604
She was sick of looking
over her shoulder, I guess.

439
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:47,340
The suburbs gave her a double
garage and a conscience.

440
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:48,775
Yeah, I find that
hard to believe.

441
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:50,543
You and your guys,

442
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:52,512
you aren't necessarily
known for your kindness.

443
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:55,448
(laughs)
Thank you.

444
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:56,816
And you're right.

445
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,818
I never forgave Sandra.

446
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,188
But not for stealing,
for leaving.

447
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:03,323
When I found out
she was still alive,

448
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:06,193
I begged her to come back,
but she said no.

449
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:09,362
Best cook I ever had.

450
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:12,665
Our profits went down over 40%
when we lost her formula.

451
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:15,402
So she was worth more
to you alive than dead.

452
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:19,306
Oh, um...

453
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:21,574
I've instructed
my guys to cooperate.

454
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:25,812
You know, alibis and stuff
for the night Sandra was killed.

455
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:27,447
Whatever the police need.

456
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,850
Okay, you do understand that
even if you weren't involved

457
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:34,121
in Sandra's death, you have
confessed to several felonies

458
00:17:34,154 --> 00:17:35,222
and we will be arresting you.

459
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:39,426
Whatever it takes to bring
Sandra's killer to justice.

460
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:40,627
Right.

461
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:51,238
That was the most cooperative
arch-criminal I've ever met.

462
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:53,173
Did you go to that club
on your own?

463
00:17:53,206 --> 00:17:54,441
What did you do to him?

464
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:56,176
Nothing.
Just made him a deal.

465
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:57,744
Of course you did.

466
00:17:57,777 --> 00:17:59,312
In exchange
for his cooperation,

467
00:17:59,346 --> 00:18:01,748
I gave him the formula
we found on Sandra's computer.

468
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:04,151
I mean, a few years in prison
is just a small price to pay

469
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:06,186
for doubling your profits
with a superior product.

470
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:10,323
You can't just hand out
random, illicit drug recipes.
Ah-ah.

471
00:18:10,357 --> 00:18:12,359
Not random,
Detective, the best.

472
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:14,427
I mean, you don't
want inferior Ecstasy

473
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:16,196
out there on the streets,
ruining orgies

474
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:18,498
and dubstep parties,
now, do you?

475
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:21,501
Rhetorical. My point is,
I got us our suspect,

476
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:24,204
so can we finally
involve the lieutenant?

477
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:26,406
We are not involving Pierce
until we check Hong's story.

478
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,209
And if what
he says is true,

479
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:30,510
he's not even a suspect.

480
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:32,412
(groans)

481
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:35,415
There's one way
to find out.

482
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,350
There is?

483
00:18:37,384 --> 00:18:38,718
Well, what are we
gonna find in there?

484
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:41,221
We already know about
Sandra's criminal past.

485
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:43,423
Yes, but what about
her criminal present?

486
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:46,826
Sandra paid cash for her house,
then two years later,

487
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:49,562
paid back the Korean mob,
with interest.

488
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:51,564
Right. How'd she
get that money?

489
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:54,367
Exactly. You can't do that
on a chemistry teacher's salary.

490
00:18:54,401 --> 00:18:55,735
So, what do we think?

491
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:57,003
She was hacking into banks?

492
00:18:57,036 --> 00:19:01,308
Or she decided to dust off her
old skill of cooking Ecstasy.

493
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:02,842
Right.
Okay.

494
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,477
Now that we know what
we're looking for,

495
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:07,347
let's try to find proof
that she was still making

496
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,782
and now selling drugs.

497
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:12,319
Huh. That's weird.

498
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:14,387
It's not connecting.

499
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:15,955
Oh, let me have a look at it.

500
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,857
Oh, Lucifer,
please don't mess with it.

501
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,392
What does this do, anyway?

502
00:19:19,426 --> 00:19:21,728
Stop shaking it.
You're gonna break it.

503
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:25,698
Ah, you're right, Detective.

504
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:28,368
It does help to know
what you're looking for.

505
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,873
Are those client lists? Ooh.

506
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:36,476
Well, an angry one, maybe.

507
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,278
"I know what you're doing.

508
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:39,546
End it or you're dead."

509
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:41,481
Ooh.

510
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:44,351
So, you can take the girl
out of the Ecstasy biz,

511
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:45,952
but you can't take
the Ecstasy biz out of the girl.

512
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:47,787
LUCIFER: Well, actually,
it's not Ecstasy.

513
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,290
It's more sort of
a homebrew Adderall.

514
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:51,724
It's very smooth. (sniffs)

515
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:53,893
Did your partner just admit
to snorting evidence?

516
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:57,430
The only thing I admit to is
being very focused on this case.

517
00:19:57,464 --> 00:19:58,965
CHLOE:
We think Sandra adjusted

518
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:01,301
her product
to her new environment.

519
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:02,802
Type-A moms,
high-pressure dads...

520
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:05,305
And all the Ivy League-bound
brats in between.

521
00:20:05,338 --> 00:20:07,640
And if she was selling,
these death threats suggest

522
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:10,343
that someone didn't want
those drugs in the neighborhood.

523
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:12,445
We think she was trying
to determine who sent them.

524
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:13,780
And maybe looking
got her killed.

525
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:15,415
All right.
Get close to the neighbors.

526
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:17,016
See who you can smoke out.

527
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,084
Right. I-I had
the exact same idea,

528
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:20,420
and there is a house for rent
on Sandra's block.

529
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:23,323
However, the owner will
only rent to couples.

530
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:24,657
Great. You and Lucifer
are on it.

531
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:25,558
No, I'd love to,

532
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:26,293
but I canvassed the
entire neighborhood.

533
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:27,394
They know I'm
a cop. Dan, too.

534
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:29,896
So find another officer
with knowledge of this case

535
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:30,897
to go undercover.

536
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,299
LUCIFER:
Oh, don't worry.

537
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:34,334
We already have.

538
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:36,736
Hey, hey.

539
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:37,904
It's the welcome wagon.

540
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:39,472
Yeah, but not
in the lame way.

541
00:20:39,506 --> 00:20:41,708
(chuckles) We just want
to be the first to say hi

542
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:44,010
to the, uh, new couple
on the block.

543
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:46,313
I'm Brian.
This is my wife Anya.
Hey.

544
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:49,716
Thank you.
That is so thoughtful.

545
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:50,950
Honey!

546
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:52,752
We have guests.

547
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:56,956
Ah. Right. Brian and
Anya, this is Marc.

548
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:59,792
Hi. Oh.
(chuckles)

549
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:08,000
Oh. (sniffs)

550
00:21:08,034 --> 00:21:09,702
Mmm.

551
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:11,371
All right.

552
00:21:11,404 --> 00:21:13,373
What, plastic plates?

553
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:14,507
What are we, barbarians?

554
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:15,642
Don't we have any
china in there?

555
00:21:15,675 --> 00:21:17,076
You know this
isn't real, right?

556
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,445
I mea...
(scoffs)

557
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:20,380
You realize this is
just for the case.

558
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:23,616
This is my chance
to really get to know you.

559
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,485
Pierce, I'm taking
it seriously

560
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:27,787
and so should you for our cause

561
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,389
and for the case, obviously.

562
00:21:29,422 --> 00:21:31,991
So, let's just get in there
and put on a good show.

563
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:33,826
Shall we? Just
don't give me

564
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,628
your resting Pierce face.

565
00:21:35,662 --> 00:21:36,763
What face?

566
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:42,935
So, how did you two
lovebirds meet?

567
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:44,537
We were high school
sweethearts, actually.

568
00:21:44,571 --> 00:21:47,740
LUCIFER: Aw.
We were biology partners.

569
00:21:47,774 --> 00:21:49,942
He asked me out while we
were dissecting a crayfish.

570
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:52,945
(laughs)
My wife. Oh, the stuff
she remembers.

571
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:55,382
(Brian chuckles)
How about you?
How'd you two meet?

572
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:57,384
At work.
Well, um, actually,

573
00:21:57,417 --> 00:21:58,918
we met through my Dad.

574
00:21:58,951 --> 00:21:59,786
ANYA:
Oh!

575
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,421
So sweet.
LUCIFER:
Well, not really.

576
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:03,022
My Dad's a right bastard.

577
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:04,724
BRIAN:
Oh, right, yes.

578
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:06,759
Tough, right?
When parents don't approve.

579
00:22:06,793 --> 00:22:08,795
It's true. True.
And my Father would definitely

580
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,096
disapprove of this.

581
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:11,398
Isn't that right, Marky Marc?

582
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:14,000
Well, let's not start with that

583
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:16,636
with these
nice people, Luke.

584
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:19,606
(sighs) I'm sorry. Marc loathes
talking about himself.

585
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:20,607
(quietly):
He's shy.

586
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,108
(normal volume):
But don't let that put you off.

587
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:23,643
I mean, we are
neighbors now, after all.

588
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:24,777
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
(chuckles)

589
00:22:24,811 --> 00:22:28,881
Feel free to ask him--
I mean, us-- anything you want.

590
00:22:28,915 --> 00:22:30,116
Okay.
All right.

591
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:31,718
Shall we?
Yes.
BRIAN: Yes.

592
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:33,386
All right.

593
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:35,154
ANYA:
Thank you.

594
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,390
LUCIFER:
Smells delicious.

595
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:40,560
DAN:
Ah, I get it.

596
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:42,495
You know,
when Chloe and I got divorced,

597
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:44,431
I was so worried about Trixie.

598
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:46,599
What she would think,
when I would see her.

599
00:22:46,633 --> 00:22:48,968
But I realized,
it's the quality of the time,

600
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:50,603
not the quantity, you know?

601
00:22:50,637 --> 00:22:52,605
I'm really glad
we did this, Dan.

602
00:22:52,639 --> 00:22:54,907
You're such a nice, normal guy.

603
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:56,576
(both chuckle)

604
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:58,545
Well, thank you, I think.

605
00:22:58,578 --> 00:23:00,780
I meant that as a compliment.
Mm-hmm.

606
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:03,616
I mean, after
the past few months,

607
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:07,887
normal is exactly
what I need in my life.

608
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,955
(chair clatters)

609
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:13,125
Hey, sexy.

610
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:14,193
What's up, Dan?

611
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,828
CHARLOTTE:
Uh, hello.

612
00:23:15,862 --> 00:23:18,865
You two know each other.

613
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:19,699
MAZE:
Oh, yeah.

614
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,934
We, uh, killed a guy
together once.

615
00:23:21,968 --> 00:23:22,735
(chuckles)

616
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:24,070
(laughs)

617
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:25,171
Maze...

618
00:23:25,204 --> 00:23:26,573
No.

619
00:23:26,606 --> 00:23:29,108
Uh, what she means is,

620
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:30,209
we had a killer time,

621
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,978
together, once.

622
00:23:32,011 --> 00:23:33,179
(nervous laugh)

623
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:34,647
Why are you here, Maze?

624
00:23:34,681 --> 00:23:36,415
Isn't it obvious?

625
00:23:41,821 --> 00:23:43,022
The three of us?

626
00:23:43,055 --> 00:23:45,024
(exhales)
I'm sorry.

627
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:47,660
Did we...?

628
00:23:47,694 --> 00:23:48,661
Oh, no.

629
00:23:48,695 --> 00:23:50,530
No. No, no, no, no, we didn't.

630
00:23:50,563 --> 00:23:52,198
No. Course n...

631
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:55,034
But if you wanted to...

632
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:56,536
um,

633
00:23:56,569 --> 00:23:59,238
now-- whatever...

634
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,541
you're into.

635
00:24:01,574 --> 00:24:03,876
I have heard that it's--
can be empowering

636
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,879
'cause I've-I've been reading
this, uh, feminist social...

637
00:24:06,913 --> 00:24:08,047
Well, I'm into it.

638
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:11,551
If she is.

639
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:15,588
(exhales)
It's ho... hot.

640
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:19,959
Oh... uh, can I have
another drink, please?

641
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:21,260
Thanks.

642
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,062
LUCIFER:
Milano?

643
00:24:23,095 --> 00:24:25,498
Ooh. They're aren't any nuts
in there, are there?

644
00:24:25,532 --> 00:24:27,133
I-I blow up like a balloon.

645
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,635
Of course, allergies.

646
00:24:28,668 --> 00:24:30,102
Yeah.
I didn't think
of that.

647
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:33,105
What makes us vulnerable is
often right under our noses.

648
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:34,641
Shellfish, maybe?

649
00:24:34,674 --> 00:24:36,075
Huh?

650
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:37,877
Bees? Latex?

651
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,046
Oh, you know I don't have
any allergies, sweetie.

652
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:42,048
Let's talk about this
lovely community.

653
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:42,982
You seem so tightknit.

654
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:44,250
Yes, yes. It must
have been devastating

655
00:24:44,283 --> 00:24:48,120
when that poor woman was found
ground up like hamburger meat.

656
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:49,689
Our Realtor told us.

657
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:51,023
Yeah, it was horrible.
Huge loss. We're...

658
00:24:51,057 --> 00:24:54,160
we're kind of one
big family around here.

659
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:55,795
ANYA:
Well, most of us, anyway.

660
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:57,997
Some of the neighbors
can be a little uptight.

661
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,867
Ah, come on, babe, the guys
don't want to hear about that.

662
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,602
Right? We're here
to welcome 'em.

663
00:25:02,635 --> 00:25:04,136
Hear about what?
The Neighborhood
Watchdog.

664
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:08,307
Someone has been writing notes
and terrorizing the block.

665
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,610
Uh, "Trim your
hedges, or else."

666
00:25:10,643 --> 00:25:12,612
"Stop using non-organic
weed killer,

667
00:25:12,645 --> 00:25:13,780
or I'll make you drink it."

668
00:25:13,813 --> 00:25:16,883
This Watchdog seems rather
preoccupied with gardening.

669
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:20,119
No. People have been getting
notes for all kinds of things.

670
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:22,889
Uh, loud music, parking,

671
00:25:22,922 --> 00:25:24,023
holiday decor.

672
00:25:24,056 --> 00:25:28,127
it's like Martha Stewart
and the Terminator had a baby.

673
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,328
(laughs)

674
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,130
Any idea who
this "Watchdog" is?

675
00:25:31,163 --> 00:25:32,865
No, actually.

676
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:34,166
Well, I suppose
we all have our mysteries.

677
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,635
Don't we? Speaking of,

678
00:25:35,668 --> 00:25:37,637
wouldn't you two
like to know more

679
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,205
about this little enigma?

680
00:25:39,238 --> 00:25:40,306
Hmm?
Well,

681
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:41,340
this has been nice.

682
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,175
Um, but remember,
we have to get get up early

683
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:44,243
for that thing tomorrow morning.

684
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:46,045
LUCIFER:
Uh...

685
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:50,016
No idea what you're
talking about, darling.

686
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:51,117
(sighs)

687
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,218
(chuckles)

688
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:54,553
BARTENDER:
Here you go.

689
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,691
(inhales)

690
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,661
(sighs)

691
00:26:01,694 --> 00:26:03,730
I thought you went
to the bathroom.

692
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:06,766
No.
(chuckles)

693
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:11,003
I'm sorry, I just...
needed a few minutes.

694
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:17,844
Truth is, I've...
been through hell lately.

695
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,381
That's it.

696
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,684
No wonder
I wanted you.

697
00:26:24,717 --> 00:26:25,718
That's it.

698
00:26:25,752 --> 00:26:27,787
I can smell it on you.

699
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:31,223
The pain, the torment.

700
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:33,225
What, it's that obvious?

701
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:34,293
Girl,

702
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:35,828
it is all over you.

703
00:26:35,862 --> 00:26:37,797
(laughs softly)
I guess I thought I was doing

704
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:40,967
a better job of covering it up.

705
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,035
You see, um...

706
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:44,904
I died recently,

707
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:49,909
or... well, almost... died.

708
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:52,879
And since then,
it's been a struggle

709
00:26:52,912 --> 00:26:55,381
to get my life back
to some semblance of normal.

710
00:26:55,414 --> 00:26:56,916
That's what you want?

711
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:58,117
Normal.

712
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:01,120
Yes. Please, God, yes.

713
00:27:01,153 --> 00:27:02,221
Well,

714
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:03,656
I am definitely not God.

715
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:04,857
Or normal.

716
00:27:04,891 --> 00:27:06,726
So, guess I'm out.

717
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:08,427
Oh, y-you are?

718
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,062
I just...

719
00:27:10,096 --> 00:27:12,264
I just told you
my deepest secret.

720
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:13,299
Yeah.

721
00:27:13,332 --> 00:27:14,233
Sorry.

722
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:15,968
I thought it was you
I was attracted to,

723
00:27:16,002 --> 00:27:18,738
but turns out,
it's just my old life.

724
00:27:18,771 --> 00:27:23,042
And I'm... not sure
if I want to go back there.

725
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:27,146
Hey, but Dan's probably
still into it, though.

726
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:29,415
Hmm.

727
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:30,750
LUCIFER:
Thanks so much for dinner, bye.

728
00:27:30,783 --> 00:27:32,051
ANYA:
Bye, have a good one.

729
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:34,754
(insects chirping)

730
00:27:34,787 --> 00:27:36,923
(Anya and Brian chatting
indistinctly)

731
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:42,028
(radio crackles)

732
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:44,196
This Watchdog weirdo seems
promising.

733
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:46,365
And those notes sound
just like the one we found

734
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:47,834
in Sandra's stash.

735
00:27:47,867 --> 00:27:50,469
I just can't imagine someone
so obsessed

736
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,004
with obeying the rules
of suburbia.

737
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:53,305
Where do you think you're going?

738
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:55,374
I cook, you clean, remember?

739
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:58,477
Domesticity can have
a strange effect on people.

740
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,979
Question is, now,

741
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:02,782
how do we draw out
this Watchdog?

742
00:28:02,815 --> 00:28:04,751
Well, don't you worry
about that, Detective.

743
00:28:04,784 --> 00:28:06,018
Trust me,

744
00:28:06,052 --> 00:28:09,121
no one's a worse neighbor
than the Devil.

745
00:28:09,155 --> 00:28:11,824
("There Goes the Neighborhood"
by Body Count playing)

746
00:28:16,796 --> 00:28:18,297
* There goes the neighborhood!

747
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:23,870
* There goes the neighborhood

748
00:28:27,506 --> 00:28:28,808
* There goes the neighborhood

749
00:28:28,841 --> 00:28:29,942
*

750
00:28:35,514 --> 00:28:37,984
* Da, da, da, da, da...

751
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:53,199
(sharp buzzing)

752
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:58,337
(door opens)

753
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,972
Lucifer.

754
00:29:00,006 --> 00:29:01,407
What, are you
building something?

755
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,608
Yes.

756
00:29:02,641 --> 00:29:05,244
Our reputation as the most
annoying neighbors on the block.

757
00:29:05,277 --> 00:29:07,279
(chuckles)

758
00:29:10,382 --> 00:29:12,251
It's 4:00 a.m.

759
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:14,120
Maybe we can finish this
in the morning.

760
00:29:14,153 --> 00:29:16,222
"We"?

761
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:18,090
You're barely involved.

762
00:29:18,124 --> 00:29:19,158
You know, I-I...

763
00:29:19,191 --> 00:29:21,260
I thought this was
supposed to be about you and I

764
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:22,829
spending time together.

765
00:29:22,862 --> 00:29:25,898
No. No, no. This is about
catching a killer.

766
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:34,006
Guys, someone's approaching
the house.

767
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,942
You just need to open up to me.

768
00:29:35,975 --> 00:29:37,977
CHLOE:
Guys?
That won't solve anything!

769
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,045
Guys, heads up.
Everyone has
their Achilles' heel.

770
00:29:39,078 --> 00:29:40,479
Someone's approaching.
We just need to find yours.

771
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:41,948
PIERCE:
Right now, mine is you.

772
00:29:41,981 --> 00:29:44,416
Guys. Damn it.

773
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,919
LUCIFER:
We've been through this.

774
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:48,587
Feel like I
don't know you.

775
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,489
PIERCE:
What are you talking about?

776
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:52,258
LAPD. Don't move.

777
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:58,397
Oh.

778
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,265
Hello.

779
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:01,333
Have you come
for your casserole dish?

780
00:30:01,367 --> 00:30:02,201
Hands up.

781
00:30:09,275 --> 00:30:11,410
BRIAN:
It's not illegal
to hold people up

782
00:30:11,443 --> 00:30:13,045
to our community standards.

783
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:14,346
The police should be
thanking me.

784
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:17,416
I'm out there every night
helping you guys.

785
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:21,053
Helping? Is that what you were
doing when you killed June Lee?

786
00:30:21,087 --> 00:30:23,322
What? I di-- I didn't hurt June.

787
00:30:23,355 --> 00:30:25,124
I understand.
You're out there,

788
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:27,126
you're trying to keep
your neighborhood clean.

789
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:29,228
And then June's there,
dealing drugs.

790
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:32,064
Wait, you think I was trying to
get June to stop dealing drugs?

791
00:30:32,098 --> 00:30:33,432
I was her best customer.

792
00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:34,600
You were buying her Adderall?

793
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:36,068
Uh, yeah.

794
00:30:36,102 --> 00:30:37,169
(chuckles)
Me and half the block.

795
00:30:37,203 --> 00:30:38,270
How do you think
I had the energy

796
00:30:38,304 --> 00:30:40,940
to be out there
every night, all night?

797
00:30:40,973 --> 00:30:43,209
I mean, June changed my life.

798
00:30:43,242 --> 00:30:45,077
I learned Mandarin.

799
00:30:45,111 --> 00:30:48,514
I built a deck around my--
I-I lost 40 pounds.

800
00:30:48,547 --> 00:30:49,681
Okay.

801
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:52,151
So you're saying you didn't
write that threatening note?

802
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:54,253
No, that's not even my
handwrit-- look, look at it.

803
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:56,288
It's so sloppy. Of course,
what do you expect from someone

804
00:30:56,322 --> 00:31:00,359
clueless enough to put a whole
body into a wood chipper? Wha...

805
00:31:00,392 --> 00:31:01,427
I-I mean,

806
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,461
saw before you mulch.

807
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:04,096
Everyone knows that.

808
00:31:05,164 --> 00:31:06,632
Thanks.

809
00:31:06,665 --> 00:31:08,167
Ah. Now, he would know

810
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,369
not to put onion skins
down the garbage disposal.

811
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:12,104
You know,
why wouldn't I put onion skins

812
00:31:12,138 --> 00:31:13,372
down the garbage disposal?

813
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:14,473
They're garbage.

814
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:16,108
They're compost.
You know what?

815
00:31:16,142 --> 00:31:17,944
Thank God
that this marriage is over.

816
00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:19,111
CHLOE:
Guys.

817
00:31:19,145 --> 00:31:20,579
Brian's not our killer.

818
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:22,448
But your cover is still intact

819
00:31:22,481 --> 00:31:23,983
and I have
a new plan.

820
00:31:24,016 --> 00:31:27,019
You lovebirds ready
to go back to suburbia?

821
00:31:28,287 --> 00:31:29,555
Ah.

822
00:31:29,588 --> 00:31:31,390
Till death do us part,

823
00:31:31,423 --> 00:31:32,992
darling.

824
00:31:37,163 --> 00:31:40,399
Well, how's this angle,
Detective?

825
00:31:40,432 --> 00:31:42,001
A little to the right,
and make sure

826
00:31:42,034 --> 00:31:43,402
you put the guest book
where I can see it.

827
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:44,937
Don't worry, Decker, we'll be
checking handwriting

828
00:31:44,971 --> 00:31:46,672
as we go along,
I just hope people show up

829
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:48,340
after Lucifer's antics.

830
00:31:48,374 --> 00:31:51,443
Ah, I've simply piqued
their curiosity.

831
00:31:51,477 --> 00:31:53,445
*

832
00:32:01,287 --> 00:32:03,289
Oh, we... we'd like
everyone to sign.

833
00:32:03,322 --> 00:32:04,723
Please.

834
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,458
Makes it more personal.

835
00:32:08,194 --> 00:32:12,131
Um, why is that hummus so
far away from the crudités?

836
00:32:12,164 --> 00:32:13,232
What?
Everyone knows

837
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:16,435
you put the snacks next
to the dipping sauce. I...

838
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:18,037
Why do I feel like I'm
the only one putting

839
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,171
any effort into anything?

840
00:32:19,205 --> 00:32:21,307
Probably because you're making
everything about you.

841
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,175
Me?

842
00:32:23,209 --> 00:32:26,712
In case you've forgotten,
I am doing this for you.

843
00:32:26,745 --> 00:32:28,280
PIERCE: Really?
LUCIFER: Yes, really.

844
00:32:28,314 --> 00:32:29,648
And if you're not committed,
then there's no point

845
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:30,649
to us even being here.

846
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:33,352
The only reason I'm here
is because I have to be.

847
00:32:33,385 --> 00:32:35,087
Ah.
Everything else
is just an empty promise.

848
00:32:36,088 --> 00:32:37,156
You have no idea
what you're doing.

849
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:38,190
I beg your pardon?

850
00:32:38,224 --> 00:32:40,726
You say you're
a man of your word.

851
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:41,727
But you're not.

852
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,030
(scoffs)

853
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:46,765
(scoffs)

854
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,301
Can't believe
he just said that.

855
00:32:49,335 --> 00:32:51,103
Excuse me!

856
00:32:56,342 --> 00:32:58,244
(whispering):
Lucifer.

857
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:00,412
Lucifer.

858
00:33:00,446 --> 00:33:03,149
What the hell are you guys
doing back there?

859
00:33:03,182 --> 00:33:05,517
This is a sting-- you can't
just leave in the middle of it.

860
00:33:05,551 --> 00:33:07,553
I just can't be
around him right now.

861
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:10,522
(scoffs) Lucifer, sometimes
when you go undercover,

862
00:33:10,556 --> 00:33:13,692
things get real, people
get on each other's nerves.

863
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:14,726
But here's the thing:

864
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,562
you can't change
your partner.

865
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:18,097
Tell me about it.

866
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:21,533
Okay... as hard as
it is right now,

867
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:25,304
I need you to stick it out
until the job's done.

868
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,506
Pierce is never gonna be
the guy who cares about

869
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:29,408
where the hummus is,
or whatever.

870
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:31,810
But he does care
about what matters.

871
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,545
Like solving this case.

872
00:33:33,579 --> 00:33:35,781
He can't do it without you,
and he knows that.

873
00:33:35,814 --> 00:33:39,218
Does he?
Yes, he does.

874
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:41,120
So, please,
get back in there

875
00:33:41,153 --> 00:33:44,190
and get those signatures.

876
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:47,726
Right.

877
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:50,462
(shouting playfully)

878
00:33:50,496 --> 00:33:51,730
(indistinct chatter)

879
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:54,066
(sighing)

880
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:04,210
You moved the nachos.

881
00:34:08,514 --> 00:34:10,716
Well, yeah, I didn't want
anyone to spill salsa...

882
00:34:10,749 --> 00:34:12,418
BOTH:
Into the macaroni.

883
00:34:18,124 --> 00:34:19,691
Wasn't sure
you were coming back.

884
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:21,193
I made you a promise.

885
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:22,761
And I am a man
of my word,

886
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:24,763
no matter what
you may think.

887
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:27,766
I may have overreacted.

888
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:29,301
I'm sorry.

889
00:34:29,335 --> 00:34:30,869
Thank you.

890
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,871
But...

891
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:36,275
you were right
about one thing.

892
00:34:36,308 --> 00:34:39,178
I don't have
all the answers.

893
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:41,680
But I hope that

894
00:34:41,713 --> 00:34:44,416
we can find them...
together.

895
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:50,156
I mean, after all, you may be
the only person on this planet

896
00:34:50,189 --> 00:34:52,724
who truly understands me.

897
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:55,227
I'm not ready
to give up on that.

898
00:34:55,261 --> 00:34:58,164
GUESTS:
Aw...

899
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:02,334
(both chuckle awkwardly)

900
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:05,103
(guests gasping, cheering)

901
00:35:10,309 --> 00:35:14,480
Wow. Cover officially restored.

902
00:35:14,513 --> 00:35:17,816
Okay, now can we please
check the book for signatures?

903
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:20,619
(indistinct chatter)

904
00:35:20,652 --> 00:35:21,687
(girl shouts playfully)

905
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:24,923
Forgive me.

906
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,592
Ah, Marcie, uh,

907
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:27,726
some words for the chef?

908
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:28,794
Ooh, I've got mustard on...

909
00:35:28,827 --> 00:35:30,329
Some words for the chef!

910
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:35,801
Lovely. Would you mind
working the word "pervert"

911
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:37,903
in there somewhere?

912
00:35:37,936 --> 00:35:40,572
Could you address it
to "scheming whore"?

913
00:35:40,606 --> 00:35:41,773
(chuckles)

914
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:44,276
Just a little private
joke for Marc.

915
00:35:45,511 --> 00:35:47,246
Brian said he signed
for us both already.

916
00:35:47,279 --> 00:35:49,248
Well, Marc and I would like
everyone to write

917
00:35:49,281 --> 00:35:50,949
a little message,
if you don't mind.
Oh.

918
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,684
Okay. Uh, let's see.

919
00:35:52,718 --> 00:35:55,187
Actually, um,
I think it's, uh...

920
00:35:55,221 --> 00:35:56,688
I think it's time
for us to go, dear.

921
00:35:56,722 --> 00:35:57,489
But we just got here.

922
00:35:57,523 --> 00:35:59,258
Uh, yeah, I know,
but we really

923
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:00,226
need to go.

924
00:36:00,259 --> 00:36:02,394
Brian, please.
What-wh-what are you doing?

925
00:36:02,428 --> 00:36:03,395
Just put the book down.

926
00:36:03,429 --> 00:36:04,530
Brian!
Brian...

927
00:36:04,563 --> 00:36:06,332
Brian, please...
Just a little message.

928
00:36:06,365 --> 00:36:07,399
No, no, no, I know
what you guys are

929
00:36:07,433 --> 00:36:08,400
trying to do here.
Brian.

930
00:36:08,434 --> 00:36:09,535
Hey, Brian, just relax, okay.

931
00:36:09,568 --> 00:36:10,536
Just calm down.

932
00:36:10,569 --> 00:36:12,971
Take it easy.

933
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:13,905
Everybody get back!

934
00:36:13,939 --> 00:36:17,543
Go on, get back.
All right, yeah? Get back.

935
00:36:17,576 --> 00:36:18,910
Brian. Bri...

936
00:36:18,944 --> 00:36:20,246
We're leaving.

937
00:36:22,814 --> 00:36:24,416
Thanks.
It was great.

938
00:36:27,653 --> 00:36:29,255
What about hedge trimmers?
Tried it. Didn't work.

939
00:36:29,288 --> 00:36:30,756
Put it down, Brian.
Uh...

940
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:33,459
I didn't want
to hurt anybody.

941
00:36:33,492 --> 00:36:37,429
I know. And I know you don't
want to hurt anyone right now.

942
00:36:37,463 --> 00:36:41,233
You're not a killer,
you're just protecting one.

943
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:44,303
Brian, what is she
talking about?

944
00:36:44,336 --> 00:36:47,906
You wrote the threatening
note to June.

945
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:49,508
We accused your husband,
but he must have

946
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,610
recognized your handwriting
when we showed it to him.

947
00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:54,613
That's why he didn't want
you signing the guest book.

948
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:58,550
You know?

949
00:36:58,584 --> 00:37:01,553
How could you do something
so stupid, babe?

950
00:37:01,587 --> 00:37:02,854
I'm not stupid.

951
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:05,457
I know that you and June
were having an affair.

952
00:37:05,491 --> 00:37:06,925
No.
I saw you

953
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:08,660
sneaking around with her,

954
00:37:08,694 --> 00:37:10,396
and then you lost
all that weight.

955
00:37:10,429 --> 00:37:11,863
I thought I would
just write her

956
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:14,300
one of those notes
to scare her off,

957
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:17,336
but then you still kept
sneaking out every night.

958
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:18,637
And then you went
and confronted her.

959
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,907
Yes, but then she
just kept denying it,

960
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,675
and I got so,

961
00:37:23,709 --> 00:37:27,346
so angry I just... shoved her,
and then she...

962
00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:28,947
she hit her head.

963
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,517
But I d--
I didn't mean to kill her.

964
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:32,651
I just...

965
00:37:32,684 --> 00:37:35,587
I just didn't want you
to leave me.

966
00:37:35,621 --> 00:37:38,056
But he wasn't having an affair.

967
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,791
June was his drug dealer.

968
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,462
It's true.

969
00:37:43,495 --> 00:37:46,332
I was buying pills from her
to help me lose weight.

970
00:37:46,365 --> 00:37:48,600
For you, so that I could
go back to being the guy

971
00:37:48,634 --> 00:37:50,636
that you fell in love
with in high school.

972
00:37:50,669 --> 00:37:53,605
I didn't want you
to leave me.

973
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:55,874
I'm so sorry
I doubted you.

974
00:37:55,907 --> 00:38:00,746
I just... I don't know what
I would do without you.

975
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:04,082
Neither do I. Oh...

976
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,751
(crying)

977
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:07,753
Okay, show's over.

978
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:08,720
(handcuffs clicking)

979
00:38:08,754 --> 00:38:10,088
Yeah, I suppose there's
some cold comfort

980
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,990
in them being
arrested together.

981
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:14,326
At least they've got each other.

982
00:38:15,694 --> 00:38:18,664
Yeah, they do.

983
00:38:25,871 --> 00:38:27,406
Dan?

984
00:38:27,439 --> 00:38:28,940
(clears throat)

985
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:30,709
Hey.

986
00:38:30,742 --> 00:38:32,778
I just wanted to
come by and apologize

987
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:33,812
about the other night.

988
00:38:33,845 --> 00:38:35,647
(chuckles)

989
00:38:35,681 --> 00:38:38,116
You have nothing
to apologize for.

990
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,486
I absolutely, completely
blame Maze.

991
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:42,020
That girl is a freak.

992
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:43,955
(laughing):
She is odd.

993
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:47,426
But she also made me realize
some things about myself.

994
00:38:47,459 --> 00:38:51,129
Maze isn't
the only odd one.

995
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,465
I'm a mess.

996
00:38:53,499 --> 00:38:57,002
All that talk about
feeling normal again?

997
00:38:57,035 --> 00:38:58,804
Wishful thinking.

998
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:01,373
I have a long road ahead.

999
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:06,378
You know, whatever
this is that we have,

1000
00:39:06,412 --> 00:39:08,346
it has never been normal.

1001
00:39:09,615 --> 00:39:13,552
And I decided that
I just have to own that.

1002
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,756
I like you, Charlotte.

1003
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:21,593
You are unlike anyone
I have ever met.

1004
00:39:21,627 --> 00:39:24,996
So if you need time
to sort some things out,

1005
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:27,433
I can wait.

1006
00:39:29,768 --> 00:39:30,569
You're worth it.

1007
00:39:30,602 --> 00:39:32,538
(chuckles softly)

1008
00:39:34,506 --> 00:39:37,543
So, I heard
the divorce went through.

1009
00:39:37,576 --> 00:39:39,177
What are you gonna do
with your half of Lux?

1010
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,146
Very funny, Decker.
(chuckles)

1011
00:39:41,179 --> 00:39:42,814
What's up?

1012
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:44,516
Some of us from the precinct
are going down to the Paddock

1013
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,751
for beers after work,

1014
00:39:45,784 --> 00:39:46,685
and I thought
you might want to join,

1015
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:48,487
if you don't have
anything better to do.

1016
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,155
I don't think I should.

1017
00:39:50,188 --> 00:39:51,990
Oh, yeah, no big deal.

1018
00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:55,026
Just, like I said,
a lot of people are going, so...

1019
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,161
Listen, Chloe,

1020
00:39:56,194 --> 00:39:58,830
you and I, it's not a good idea.

1021
00:39:58,864 --> 00:40:03,168
Oh, I wasn't suggesting
anything romantic at all.

1022
00:40:03,201 --> 00:40:04,770
I just...
Listen, it's just

1023
00:40:04,803 --> 00:40:07,038
we deal with death
every day,

1024
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:09,508
and...

1025
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:10,942
everybody's gonna die.

1026
00:40:10,976 --> 00:40:12,878
Someday you'll die,
and I just...

1027
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:14,580
Yeah.

1028
00:40:14,613 --> 00:40:17,015
Losing your brother,
it's still

1029
00:40:17,048 --> 00:40:18,517
really affecting you, huh?

1030
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:22,621
Understatement
of the millennia.

1031
00:40:22,654 --> 00:40:25,691
I understand.
I do.

1032
00:40:25,724 --> 00:40:28,794
And about tonight,
it's not a big deal.

1033
00:40:30,829 --> 00:40:31,963
But...

1034
00:40:31,997 --> 00:40:38,069
just so I know
that I'm not crazy, um...

1035
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:39,204
in the surveillance van,

1036
00:40:39,237 --> 00:40:42,140
when I asked you
to stay in L.A.,

1037
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:45,511
we did have a moment
there, yeah?

1038
00:40:46,978 --> 00:40:48,246
We did share a moment.

1039
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,215
Which is why I had
to tell you

1040
00:40:50,248 --> 00:40:53,885
that I'm not
relationship material.

1041
00:40:53,919 --> 00:40:55,721
Mm.

1042
00:40:57,723 --> 00:41:00,592
Well, for what it's worth,

1043
00:41:00,626 --> 00:41:01,827
it was a really nice moment.

1044
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:05,096
* Tell me, who's that writin'

1045
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,898
* John the Revelator

1046
00:41:06,932 --> 00:41:09,701
* Tell me, who's that writin'

1047
00:41:09,735 --> 00:41:11,570
* John the Revelator

1048
00:41:11,603 --> 00:41:14,205
* Tell me, who's that writin'

1049
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:17,509
* John the Revelator...
Lucifer, this better be good.

1050
00:41:17,543 --> 00:41:19,277
I was really looking forward
to sleeping

1051
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,246
far away from you tonight.

1052
00:41:21,279 --> 00:41:23,248
Oh, it is good.

1053
00:41:23,281 --> 00:41:25,784
I've finally got
you figured out.

1054
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:28,019
(chuckles)
Really?
Mm, yes.

1055
00:41:28,053 --> 00:41:30,589
You're terrified of letting
someone get close to you

1056
00:41:30,622 --> 00:41:33,091
'cause you know they'll
eventually leave you.

1057
00:41:33,124 --> 00:41:35,093
You'll outlive them.

1058
00:41:35,126 --> 00:41:36,962
You want to die because

1059
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:38,864
you don't want to
be alone anymore.

1060
00:41:38,897 --> 00:41:40,899
Yeah, well, duh.

1061
00:41:40,932 --> 00:41:42,601
What's your point?
If we're gonna kill you...

1062
00:41:44,035 --> 00:41:47,573
...then we have got
to do it together.

1063
00:41:47,606 --> 00:41:49,307
Is that right?

1064
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,942
Mm.

1065
00:41:50,976 --> 00:41:52,678
You see, I don't think you've
been spending time with me

1066
00:41:52,711 --> 00:41:54,613
trying to figure out
how to kill me.

1067
00:41:54,646 --> 00:41:55,947
I think you want
to spend time

1068
00:41:55,981 --> 00:41:58,016
with someone who's been
screwed by your Dad

1069
00:41:58,049 --> 00:41:59,150
as much as you've been.

1070
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:02,921
You are the one that
doesn't want to be alone.

1071
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:07,859
I suppose one might
call us friends now.

1072
00:42:07,893 --> 00:42:11,096
And it is nice to have
a friend who can relate.

1073
00:42:11,129 --> 00:42:12,598
I get you.

1074
00:42:12,631 --> 00:42:14,900
No, you don't.

1075
00:42:14,933 --> 00:42:17,135
But you've been
on the earth, what, five years?

1076
00:42:17,168 --> 00:42:19,905
You'll see.

1077
00:42:19,938 --> 00:42:22,140
It's hard not
to get attached.

1078
00:42:22,173 --> 00:42:24,910
Okay. Okay.

1079
00:42:24,943 --> 00:42:26,878
So we both have some issues
that we need to work through.

1080
00:42:26,912 --> 00:42:29,715
But if we're gonna
get revenge on Dad,

1081
00:42:29,748 --> 00:42:31,717
we've got to be committed.

1082
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,619
I've already married you.

1083
00:42:33,652 --> 00:42:35,987
I'm not sure how much
more committed I could be.

1084
00:42:36,021 --> 00:42:37,956
(laughing)

1085
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,926
True. True.

1086
00:42:40,959 --> 00:42:42,728
But there are
so many things

1087
00:42:42,761 --> 00:42:44,329
that we never got to try.

1088
00:42:44,362 --> 00:42:46,197
* John the Revelator

1089
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:49,901
* Wrote the book
of the seven seals *

1090
00:42:49,935 --> 00:42:51,837
Fine.

1091
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:53,739
Go get the chain saw.

1092
00:42:53,772 --> 00:42:56,808
Oh, I thought you'd never ask.
(chuckles)

1093
00:42:56,842 --> 00:43:01,647
* Wrote the book
of the seven seals. *
