who's gonna let you in,

you'll give me the chance.

Mom! Lucifer said
that you were gone.

You know Lucifer.

why you hurt her feelings.

at the beach.

Angry? Leather? Lots of knives?

354
00:13:04,305 --> 00:13:05,872
Or someone completely different?

355
00:13:05,915 --> 00:13:08,657
Like a dude?
Like a fat, happy dude?ZACK: No.

356
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,180
What he said.

357
00:13:10,224 --> 00:13:12,443
A pretty woman in black leather
came looking for Mike.

358
00:13:12,487 --> 00:13:14,924
Right. Well, Morningstar,
one, Decker, nil.

359
00:13:14,968 --> 00:13:16,926
Not that I'm counting.Anyhow, carry on.

360
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,667
ZACK: Uh, Mike was out
at the time,

361
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:21,278
so she hung around his trailer,
then took off.

362
00:13:21,322 --> 00:13:23,803
When I told him,
he kind of freaked out about it.

363
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:25,935
Then I forgot all about it.

364
00:13:25,979 --> 00:13:28,895
Uh, could we get a look
at that trailer?

365
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,943
Oh. Oh, this is
lovely, isn't it?

366
00:13:34,944 --> 00:13:36,816
Aha!

367
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:38,730
Her favorite beverage.

368
00:13:38,774 --> 00:13:41,385
Well, surely this is evidence
that Maze is guilty.

369
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:43,387
And well hydrated.

370
00:13:43,431 --> 00:13:45,737
Well, let's just wait
and see what the lab has to say.

371
00:13:45,781 --> 00:13:48,479
I'm sure lots of people
drink green tea coconut water.

372
00:13:48,523 --> 00:13:50,351
[scoffs] Right.

373
00:13:51,961 --> 00:13:54,877
I told you not to
talk to Charlotte,

374
00:13:54,921 --> 00:13:57,837
and you literally did the
exact opposite of what I said.

375
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,317
Why bother asking
for my advice at all?

376
00:14:00,361 --> 00:14:02,015
I couldn't help it,
Linda, all right?

377
00:14:02,058 --> 00:14:03,581
I'm sorry.

378
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,322
She's not your mother anymore.

379
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:07,324
She's a human woman in pain

380
00:14:07,368 --> 00:14:09,326
who isn't ready
to hear what you have to say.

381
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,806
Well, I disagree.

382
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,417
She's in pain because
she doesn't know the full story.

383
00:14:13,461 --> 00:14:16,551
Whether or not she's my mother,
Linda, I owe her the truth.

384
00:14:17,987 --> 00:14:19,075
At least some of the truth.

385
00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:21,599
I didn't go into
the celestial details.

386
00:14:21,643 --> 00:14:23,732
And she can tell
you're holding back.

387
00:14:23,775 --> 00:14:25,865
And now she has more questions.

388
00:14:26,822 --> 00:14:27,997
I really thought we decided

389
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,346
we weren't gonna do this.

390
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,695
You mean youdecided.

391
00:14:30,739 --> 00:14:33,481
You decided, Linda.

392
00:14:33,524 --> 00:14:35,875
Just like how you decided
that we were over.

393
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:39,748
Point taken.

394
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:43,012
But Amenadiel, please,
ask yourself...

395
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:45,014
are you doing this

396
00:14:45,058 --> 00:14:48,017
because you think
it's what's best for Charlotte,

397
00:14:48,061 --> 00:14:50,498
or what's best for you?

398
00:14:56,591 --> 00:14:57,505
Oh, my God.

399
00:14:57,548 --> 00:14:59,507
You guys are so adorable.

400
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,638
I can't even stand it.

401
00:15:00,682 --> 00:15:02,379
Looks like you caught us, Lopez.

402
00:15:02,423 --> 00:15:04,599
Uh, hey. Did you get anything
back on the coconut water?

403
00:15:04,642 --> 00:15:07,907
Uh, no, but they are
rushing the order.

404
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,734
Chloe.

405
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:10,822
Hey.

406
00:15:10,866 --> 00:15:11,823
Pierce.

407
00:15:12,824 --> 00:15:14,565
I, uh, looked into

408
00:15:14,609 --> 00:15:15,740
other known associates
of the victim.

409
00:15:15,784 --> 00:15:17,525
Surviving family members,
etcetera.

410
00:15:17,568 --> 00:15:19,657
So far, no leads.Okay.

411
00:15:19,701 --> 00:15:21,529
Oh.

412
00:15:21,572 --> 00:15:23,009
Here, have a seat.

413
00:15:25,098 --> 00:15:27,143
Ah, lovely. Thank you very much.Yeah.

414
00:15:27,187 --> 00:15:28,579
It's not like
there's 20 other chairs.

415
00:15:28,623 --> 00:15:29,580
LUCIFER:
Ooh!

416
00:15:29,624 --> 00:15:30,799
All warmed up for me.

417
00:15:30,842 --> 00:15:32,714
So, any news
on our murderous friend?

418
00:15:32,757 --> 00:15:33,976
Listen, guys, if Maze did this,

419
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,413
would any of you
really be shocked?

420
00:15:36,457 --> 00:15:37,414
Yeah.I would.

421
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:38,633
No, not at all.There's no way.

422
00:15:38,676 --> 00:15:40,765
MAZE: Let me settle
it for you.

423
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:42,942
I did it.

424
00:15:50,558 --> 00:15:51,559
What are you all waiting for?

425
00:15:51,602 --> 00:15:53,648
I just said I did it.

426
00:15:53,691 --> 00:15:54,866
Maze, hold on.

427
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,085
You have the right
to remain silent.

428
00:15:56,129 --> 00:15:57,434
Anything you say

429
00:15:57,478 --> 00:15:59,045
can and will
be used against you...

430
00:15:59,088 --> 00:16:00,829
Don't have time for all of that.

431
00:16:00,872 --> 00:16:03,745
I'm the big, bad killer,
so let's move it along.

432
00:16:03,788 --> 00:16:05,703
Agreed. Let's book her.

433
00:16:05,747 --> 00:16:06,878
Lucifer,
it's called due process.

434
00:16:06,922 --> 00:16:08,054
She doesn't have to do this.

435
00:16:08,097 --> 00:16:09,794
The evidence against her
is circumstantial.

436
00:16:09,838 --> 00:16:11,971
Well, let me help you with that.

437
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:14,582
Murder weapon should do it.

438
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,671
Put it down. Now.

439
00:16:17,715 --> 00:16:19,239
All yours.

440
00:16:21,154 --> 00:16:23,765
Come on, boys.

441
00:16:23,808 --> 00:16:25,071
You know you want to.

442
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:28,596
Stand up.Oh.

443
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,771
Stand up.[grunts]

444
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:32,730
[chuckles]

445
00:16:36,647 --> 00:16:38,475
I know this looks bad.

446
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:39,650
We have a video,

447
00:16:39,694 --> 00:16:41,000
a murder weapon,
and a full confession.

448
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:42,871
I know. It just...

449
00:16:42,914 --> 00:16:44,612
It doesn't feel like her.

450
00:16:44,655 --> 00:16:45,743
I thought you said you weren't
gonna let your feelings

451
00:16:45,787 --> 00:16:46,918
get in the way of this case.

452
00:16:46,962 --> 00:16:49,008
And I'm not.Just like you're not letting

453
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:50,922
your feelings for Lucifer
get between you and me?

454
00:16:50,966 --> 00:16:52,707
W-What?

455
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,100
Is there something going on...

456
00:16:54,143 --> 00:16:56,015
between you and Lucifer?

457
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:58,800
No. No.

458
00:16:58,843 --> 00:17:01,063
Lucifer and I,
we-we're partners.

459
00:17:01,107 --> 00:17:02,630
We're friends.

460
00:17:02,673 --> 00:17:05,720
Do all your friends
give you jewelry?

461
00:17:05,763 --> 00:17:07,591
This?

462
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,507
Lucifer gave me this as a joke.

463
00:17:10,551 --> 00:17:12,031
It's a funny story, actually.

464
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:14,511
[laughs]: He says
it was the closest I ever came

465
00:17:14,555 --> 00:17:15,773
to penetrating him.

466
00:17:16,731 --> 00:17:17,688
Which, see,

467
00:17:17,732 --> 00:17:19,168
we've never actually had sex.

468
00:17:19,212 --> 00:17:20,909
Oh.
Never mind.

469
00:17:20,952 --> 00:17:22,824
[clears throat]It just...
It was funny at the time.

470
00:17:22,867 --> 00:17:24,260
Well, we're gonna book Maze.

471
00:17:24,304 --> 00:17:26,523
If you really believe
she's innocent,

472
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:27,959
you're gonna have to bring in
the real killer.

473
00:17:28,003 --> 00:17:29,700
I'll start by talking to her.

474
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,530
[scoffs] More talking?

475
00:17:33,574 --> 00:17:34,575
LUCIFER:
Less of a conversation,

476
00:17:34,618 --> 00:17:36,794
really, more of a "j'accuse."

477
00:17:36,838 --> 00:17:38,840
CHLOE: We just want
to have a chat--

478
00:17:38,883 --> 00:17:39,928
as friends,

479
00:17:39,971 --> 00:17:42,061
because that's what we are.Are we?

480
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:43,540
Let's talk motive,

481
00:17:43,584 --> 00:17:45,934
because I cannot think
of a single reason

482
00:17:45,977 --> 00:17:47,675
why you would want
to kill that man.

483
00:17:47,718 --> 00:17:49,068
Who needs a reason?

484
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:50,895
I'm just evil.

485
00:17:50,939 --> 00:17:52,810
I mean, that's
what you all think, right?

486
00:17:52,854 --> 00:17:54,029
No.Right.

487
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,552
Look, I've told you
already, Detective,

488
00:17:55,596 --> 00:17:57,772
she is doing this
to manipulate me.

489
00:17:57,815 --> 00:17:58,947
Well, newsflash, Mazikeen.

490
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,557
I am not taking you home.

491
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:01,602
Yeah, I heard you
the first time,

492
00:18:01,645 --> 00:18:02,646
and I don't care.

493
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:03,734
This way,

494
00:18:03,778 --> 00:18:04,996
I'll end up in women's prison.

495
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,651
I heard it's hell on earth,
so close enough.

496
00:18:07,695 --> 00:18:10,132
Right. Well, maybe
orange is the new Maze.

497
00:18:10,176 --> 00:18:11,699
Perhaps some time in the clink

498
00:18:11,742 --> 00:18:13,831
might actually make you sorry
for trying to control me.

499
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,137
What are you talking about?

500
00:18:15,181 --> 00:18:16,573
She could get life in prison.

501
00:18:16,617 --> 00:18:18,575
That's a mere time-out
in her lifespan.

502
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:19,968
[scoffs]

503
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:22,275
All right, let's talk
about the actual crime.

504
00:18:22,318 --> 00:18:23,711
Maze, tell me what happened.

505
00:18:23,754 --> 00:18:25,016
I stabbed a guy.

506
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,888
See?

507
00:18:26,931 --> 00:18:28,585
How many times?

508
00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:29,891
Two or three.

509
00:18:30,892 --> 00:18:31,893
Or four?

510
00:18:31,936 --> 00:18:32,981
You're not even close.

511
00:18:33,024 --> 00:18:34,722
The victim
was stabbed ten times.

512
00:18:34,765 --> 00:18:35,723
Right, well,

513
00:18:35,766 --> 00:18:36,854
I was mad,

514
00:18:36,898 --> 00:18:38,595
so guess I forgot to count.

515
00:18:38,639 --> 00:18:40,989
Did you happen to follow
the victim to a winery?

516
00:18:41,032 --> 00:18:43,252
Sure.Drink anything while
you were there?

517
00:18:43,296 --> 00:18:44,732
Wine.

518
00:18:49,389 --> 00:18:51,347
[sighs]

519
00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:52,914
Now do you believe me?I believe you.

520
00:18:52,957 --> 00:18:54,176
Yes. I knew she didn't do it.Yes.

521
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,960
[sighs] You know what
this means, Detective.

522
00:18:56,004 --> 00:18:57,397
We need to bust Maze out.

523
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,008
Let's smuggle her something
she can use to escape.

524
00:19:00,051 --> 00:19:03,185
I...What happened to "a mere
time-out" in women's prison?

525
00:19:03,229 --> 00:19:05,274
Well, we can't punish
the innocent,

526
00:19:05,318 --> 00:19:07,972
or even the usually guilty
but innocent this one time.

527
00:19:08,016 --> 00:19:09,148
It's the principle
of the matter.

528
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:10,453
We have to find the real killer.

529
00:19:10,497 --> 00:19:12,325
It's the only way
to keep Maze out of jail.

530
00:19:12,368 --> 00:19:13,369
CHARLOTTE:

531
00:19:13,413 --> 00:19:14,718
headed for jail?

532
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:15,893
I'm ready to draw up

533
00:19:15,937 --> 00:19:17,025

for Mazikeen Smith.

534
00:19:17,068 --> 00:19:19,158
Hey, hang on.
I'll grab my paperwork.

535
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:21,638
I'd love to chat
with you, Lucifer.

536
00:19:21,682 --> 00:19:24,032
Well, I'm terribly busy,
Charlotte. I'm sorry.

537
00:19:24,075 --> 00:19:25,076
It's important.

538
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:27,775
Maybe somewhere
a little more private?

539
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:32,258
Look, I-I really am in a
bit of a rush, Charlotte.Of course.

540
00:19:32,301 --> 00:19:34,651
I just wanted to mention
I met your brother, Amenadiel.

541
00:19:34,695 --> 00:19:36,175
Oh, dearie me.

542

I bet that was a snooze.

543
00:19:37,915 --> 00:19:39,656
So you confirm
that he's your brother?

544
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,180
Well, yes, of course.

545
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:43,007
Well, he had some
interesting things to say,

546
00:19:43,051 --> 00:19:44,661
things that
you never mentioned.

547
00:19:44,705 --> 00:19:46,663
For starters, would've been nice

548
00:19:46,707 --> 00:19:49,188
to know that you were my stepson
before I kissed you that night.

549
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:50,319
[laughs] "Stepson"?

550
00:19:50,363 --> 00:19:51,886
Right.Yeah.

551
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:53,931
That would've been far
preferable, Mum...

552
00:19:53,975 --> 00:19:55,019
Mum...

553
00:19:55,063 --> 00:19:55,977
my dear Charlotte.

554
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,021
You said "Mum."

555
00:19:57,065 --> 00:19:58,022
Did I?

556
00:19:58,066 --> 00:19:59,198
So I was...

557
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:00,764
I was your stepmom?

558
00:20:00,808 --> 00:20:02,113
Well, not anymore.

559
00:20:02,157 --> 00:20:03,202
Look, it...

560
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:04,420
it's complicated, Charlotte,

561
00:20:04,464 --> 00:20:06,944
and I am horribly
crunched for time, so...

562
00:20:06,988 --> 00:20:08,119

and don't lie to me.

to know the truth.

junior associate, you didn't.

573
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:34,015

went straight to Hell.

574
00:20:34,058 --> 00:20:35,973
Your empty body
became a-a vessel

575

the goddess of all creation,

577
00:20:39,412 --> 00:20:41,022
started bursting out
of your midsection.

578
00:20:41,065 --> 00:20:42,371
Naturally, I sent her
to another universe

579
00:20:42,415 --> 00:20:43,851
so she wouldn't
destroy this one.

580
00:20:43,894 --> 00:20:45,287
Once she vacated your body,

581
00:20:45,331 --> 00:20:47,246
you, Charlotte,
came back to life.

582
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:49,465

Well, there it is.

586

00:20:58,909 --> 00:21:00,911

602
00:21:33,814 --> 00:21:36,425
Well, I don't think
that you are.

I mean, honestly,

someone look more guilty.

00:21:44,215 --> 00:21:46,305
But...

608
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:48,219
I have faith in you anyway.

00:21:50,961 --> 00:21:54,791
Well, there is one thing
that you could do for me.

00:21:54,835 --> 00:21:56,097
Yeah. Name it.

611
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:59,056

Inconclusive.

620
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:20,208

They were yours.

622
00:22:21,601 --> 00:22:23,037
LUCIFER: Well, if your
prints are on that can,

623
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,213
that means someone
must've broke into your house

624
00:22:25,256 --> 00:22:26,997
and stolen it
from your wheelie bins.

625
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:29,086
What?Your trash.
