00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:04,101
<i>Previously on</i> lucifer...
Amenadiel:<i> Who escaped hell?</i>

2
00:00:04,105 --> 00:00:05,095
Mum.

3
00:00:05,106 --> 00:00:06,266
Dad got pissed off

4
00:00:06,273 --> 00:00:07,473
and tossed me out of the house.

5
00:00:07,475 --> 00:00:08,605
And what did your mother do?

6
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:10,139
She just stood there
and let it happen.

7
00:00:10,144 --> 00:00:12,614
A couple of a thousand years
later, dad kicked her out, too.

8
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:16,453
So I did the same for her
as she did for me: Zilch.

9
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:19,280
So, mama morningstar's
on the loose.

10
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:20,616
I never could
break that woman.

11
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:22,291
She wouldn't submit.

12
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:23,959
What are you doing here?
I've been demoted.

13
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:25,958
Been reassigned
to assist on cases.

14
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,630
You lied to me
about being a doctor.

15
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:29,959
Do you realize

16
00:00:29,964 --> 00:00:31,864
the ethical position
you've put me in?

17
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:36,795
Lucifer:<i> If she's not</i>
<i>coming to kill me,</i>

18
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:38,304
then I don't know
what she's doing.

19
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:39,365
<i>That's truly terrifying.</i>

20
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:42,505
Lucifer.

21
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:43,640
Mum.

22
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:45,544
Help me.

23
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:49,822
â™ª â™ª

24
00:00:49,817 --> 00:00:51,317
(overlapping, echoing voices):
Hello?

25
00:00:51,318 --> 00:00:52,648
Are you okay?
He just collapsed.

26
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:54,823
Does anyone know cpr?
No, I don't know.

27
00:00:54,822 --> 00:00:56,492
Hello? Are you okay?

28
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,820
Call 911!

29
00:00:57,825 --> 00:00:59,655
Uh, heart attack maybe?

30
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,490
I think he might be dead.

31
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:02,585
(gasps)

32
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:07,998
woman:
Sir? Sir?

33
00:01:08,002 --> 00:01:09,672
Lucifer?
Sir, are you okay?

34
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,670
Lucifer? Where are you?

35
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:12,341
Sir, are you okay?

36
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:14,169
Has anyone seen lucifer?

37
00:01:14,175 --> 00:01:15,165
(horn blaring)

38
00:01:15,176 --> 00:01:16,836
(people screaming)

39
00:01:16,844 --> 00:01:20,014
â™ª I never gave up so easily... â™ª

40
00:01:20,014 --> 00:01:22,554
(gunshots)

41
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:25,520
â™ª when you put
your black magic over me â™ª

42
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,859
â™ª you did whatever you could â™ª

43
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:33,227
â™ª nobody likes it
when you're good... â™ª

44
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:36,027
(gasps)

45
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,360
lucifer.

46
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:39,034
I need to find lucifer.

47
00:01:39,033 --> 00:01:43,203
Man. Thought I killed your ass.

48
00:01:43,204 --> 00:01:47,874
â™ª well, I'll be
so innocent, innocent. â™ª

49
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:49,265
(gasps)

50
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:54,208
(panting)

51
00:01:54,215 --> 00:01:56,145
(phone ringing,
echoing in distance)

52
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:09,801
(ringing continues)

53
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:19,641
girl (over phone):
Hey, mom?

54
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:24,143
Mommy...

55
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,910
(panting)

56
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,146
(groans)

57
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:43,158
(groaning)

58
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:53,943
(grunts)

59
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:55,841
(panting)

60
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:09,446
lucifer.

61
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:13,626
And that's when I started
looking for you, son.

62
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:15,127
At least I've
managed to keep

63
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:17,459
this flesh sack
in one piece.

64
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:19,504
It has not been easy.

65
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,700
Quite a few of the male species
have been eying me hungrily.

66
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:25,644
Do humans eat their own?

67
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:28,339
Well, say something.

68
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:30,142
Aren't you glad
to see me?

69
00:03:30,144 --> 00:03:32,314
I apologize for my
human form, but...

70
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:35,383
At least this one has
supreme hindquarters.

71
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:38,351
You're lying.

72
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:40,152
No. They're quite
sturdy. Feel it.

73
00:03:40,154 --> 00:03:41,824
I wasn't referring,

74
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:44,822
nor will I ever refer,
to your butt, mother.

75
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:47,985
I simply don't believe
your wounded bird story.

76
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:49,595
You're the goddess
of all creation.

77
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:53,034
Not anymore, unfortunately.

78
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:55,003
Now I'm just trapped
in this stinky human

79
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:56,502
with the exceptional ass.

80
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:59,843
I swear, all I've done for three
days is wander this cesspool,

81
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,410
asking these vacuous cretins
how to find you.

82
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,210
What are you doing?

83
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:09,615
Calling amenadiel.

84
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:11,724
Oh!

85
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,219
Wonderful. He's here, too?

86
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,050
Yes. And he'll be the one
taking you back to hell, so...

87
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:17,056
What?!

88
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,517
Why?

89
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:21,025
Because you're dangerous
and terrifying.

90
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:23,698
I promise you I'm not
here to hurt anyone.

91
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:25,727
(laughs)
you have to
believe me.

92
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:29,033
My entire focus has been
on finding you, son.

93
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:30,696
So you can eviscerate me?
Got it.

94
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:34,374
No. We've wasted enough
time being... Estranged.

95
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:37,035
I'd do anything to
rectify that now.

96
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:39,084
Sure you don't mean
"revenge that"?

97
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:42,879
Lucifer, your father
put me in hell.

98
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:44,423
Not you. I know that.

99
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:45,418
Yes.

100
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,889
But I was your warden.

101
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:49,388
Not by choice.

102
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,990
We were both wronged.

103
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:57,061
But you could have
at least visited me.

104
00:04:57,064 --> 00:04:59,404
(laughs):
Oh, I'm sorry.

105
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,230
When dad cast me out,
who stood by and did nothing?

106
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:05,066
Hint: It's a palindrome
for "mum."

107
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:08,612
well, maybe if you had talked
to me in hell instead of sending

108
00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:10,109
your little demon torturer,

109
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,940
I could've explained
the whole thing.

110
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:13,245
You're right,
you're right.

111
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:15,907
But I'm here now,
so by all means, explain.

112
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,446
(sighs)

113
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:21,251
you wouldn't believe me.

114
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:25,755
I know how suspicious
and untrusting you are.

115
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,089
You don't know
anything about me.

116
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:30,425
Lucifer.

117
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:32,261
I'm your mother.

118
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:36,166
Not for a very, very long time.

119
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:40,674
Well, I want to be now.

120
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:50,324
Then I'm going to
need you to prove

121
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:52,347
your little
origin story to me.

122
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:55,951
We'll retrace your steps.

123
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:58,286
If I don't find a trail
of bloodshed and carnage,

124
00:05:58,292 --> 00:05:59,832
then perhaps I'll believe you.

125
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:03,657
Fine. We'll begin where I found
the tiny spear in my neck.

126
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:05,964
Fine.
Hmm.

127
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:07,496
Gonna need to get you
some clean clothes.

128
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:10,471
Humans tend to frown
at the sight of blood.

129
00:06:10,471 --> 00:06:12,301
Yes.

130
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:13,966
I've noticed.

131
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:15,814
â™ª he set me on â™ª

132
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:17,979
â™ª fire â™ª

133
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:20,148
â™ª he set me on â™ª

134
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:21,647
â™ª fire â™ª

135
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:23,318
(door opens)

136
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:26,177
â™ª he set me on fire... â™ª

137
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:27,316
(door closes)

138
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:29,821
uh, just leave it,
would you?

139
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:31,863
Gosh, perhaps we shouldn't
have borrowed from maze.

140
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:34,989
Her clothing is insufficient.

141
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:36,825
Yes. Half my
hide<i> is</i> exposed.

142
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,330
Human attire is
very impractical.

143
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,833
They're morons, aren't they?

144
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:42,334
Oh. So you admit
you revile them?

145
00:06:42,336 --> 00:06:44,496
To revile them would be
to care about them,

146
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:47,065
which I do not.

147
00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:55,347
Then all those rumors

148
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:57,179
about why dad
sent you to hell--

149
00:06:57,184 --> 00:06:58,354
the plagues,

150
00:06:58,352 --> 00:07:01,692
the floods--
they weren't you?

151
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:02,718
Well...

152
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:05,023
Yeah. That's what
I thought.

153
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:06,355
I was angry.

154
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,530
But humans weren't

155
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:10,358
the reason your father and I
were fighting.

156
00:07:10,364 --> 00:07:12,034
At least, not then.

157
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:13,872
Uh, mum?

158
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,067
Hmm?

159
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:23,712
I think you left out
a minor detail.

160
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,280
Oh, dear.

161
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:31,323
â™ª â™ª

162
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:43,426
liar, liar, slutty
dress on fire, mother.

163
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,060
Whoever destroyed my human suit

164
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:48,095
must have killed this little imp
as well; it's obvious.

165
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:49,231
(chuckles)

166
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:50,766
lucifer, honey,

167
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:54,071
why would I bring you here
just to disprove my story?

168
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:55,744
I don't know.

169
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:58,242
But that's exactly
what I'm going to find out.

170
00:07:58,245 --> 00:08:00,805
(knocking on door)
man: Management.

171
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:04,579
Don't... Wait! Wait.
Why?

172
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:06,915
Because there is a dead man
lying on the bed.

173
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,920
Humans don't like
that sort of thing.

174
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,922
Fine. Then let's
fly out the window.
What...

175
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:13,434
I don't have wings
anymore, mum.

176
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:14,957
What?

177
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:17,102
It's a long story.

178
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:18,157
Come on. This way.

179
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:22,501
Management.

180
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:26,104
Yeah, this way.

181
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:27,936
What happened
to your wings, son?

182
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:29,441
I cut them off.

183
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:31,613
Why would you...?
I mean, come to earth,

184
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:33,782
get a haircut or something,
but that's a little extreme.

185
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,510
Hey, bud.

186
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:38,617
Can I tag in next?

187
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:39,779
Excuse me?

188
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:40,946
With the lady.

189
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:42,494
How much?

190
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:44,519
This one you<i> could</i>
kill. Come on.

191
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:46,986
I'm joking!

192
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:49,464
I'm joking, mother.

193
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:50,803
Gosh.

194
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:52,457
You're gonna have to
lose those clothes.

195
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:54,296
They're a
serious problem.

196
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:55,801
Taking you home,

197
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:59,142
'cause this being out in public
thing obviously isn't working.

198
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:01,469
And then I'm gonna
see my colleague...

199
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:02,965
Mum!

200
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:04,636
Yes?
You're naked!

201
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:07,975
Well, you said the clothes were
a problem, so problem solved.

202
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:11,151
Get in the bloody
car, will you?!

203
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:13,321
God. Traumatized
for eternity now,

204
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,820
so thank you
very much for that.

205
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:15,991
(engine starts)

206
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:18,659
â™ª ask me 'bout
the things we did â™ª

207
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:19,659
(tires screeching)

208
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,490
â™ª it's complicated â™ª

209
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:25,996
â™ª when we get naked â™ª

210
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:27,829
â™ª but I can take it... â™ª

211
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:29,674
(elevator bell dings)

212
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,170
maze?

213
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:32,501
Ah, good, you're still here.

214
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:33,836
I have a job for you.

215
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,840
On my way out, lucifer.
No more jobs.

216
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:37,542
Yes, yes, I know.
You don't work for me anymore.

217
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:40,254
Very clear. But I have a feeling
you're gonna love this one.

218
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:43,348
Just think of it
as a parting gift.

219
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,550
Come on.

220
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:46,021
(clears throat)

221
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:49,749
hello, mazikeen.

222
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:54,386
Is that her?

223
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:55,394
Mm-hmm.

224
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:56,855
In a human body?

225
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:58,263
(chuckles)
well, unfortunately.

226
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:00,572
For you.

227
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:03,567
I appreciate your enthusiasm,
maze, but hands off.

228
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,870
What?

229
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:05,941
You're kidding.

230
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,540
Millennia, lucifer...

231
00:10:09,543 --> 00:10:11,783
With no physical form.
(chuckles)

232
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:15,614
but now...

233
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:19,879
...Look at all that flesh.

234
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:21,546
Lucifer: Yes, but sorry, dear.
No torture.

235
00:10:21,555 --> 00:10:23,385
Just don't let her
out of your sight.

236
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,420
Until I've worked out
whether she's lying or not,

237
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:26,625
she can't be trusted.

238
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:31,055
You want me to babysit?

239
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:32,934
Well, "my mum in the body of
a disturbingly hot woman"-sit,

240
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:34,633
but yes, for now.

241
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:40,635
(clicks tongue) mmm.

242
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:59,486
I was just trying to give
tammy twinkletoes a makeover.

243
00:11:04,464 --> 00:11:07,774
Honey, you...
You popped out her eye.

244
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:09,928
Yeah.

245
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:11,436
That was an accident.

246
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:14,438
Lucifer (over intercom): Well, I
think she looks rather fetching.

247
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:15,641
Lucifer.

248
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:18,442
Hello, detective.
Sir douche. Offspring.

249
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:20,445
Chloe: You know,
I bet you're actually

250
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,107
behind this, aren't you?
Sadly, no.

251
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:24,115
Can't take the credit,
but I do approve.

252
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:26,147
Can we get to work now, please?

253
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,823
I'm just wondering if there's
any fresh homicides popped up.

254
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:29,952
(sighs)

255
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:31,456
ooh, you know,
when you make that face,

256
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:32,788
you look a bit like the doll.

257
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:33,863
(scoffs)

258
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,795
(lucifer humming dance beat)

259
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:39,458
hey.
Ah, look.

260
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:41,826
You can disco a bad guy
into confessing.

261
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:43,465
This isn't a game;
this is parenting.

262
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,840
And it's important.

263
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:47,508
She mutilated
tammy twinkletoes.

264
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:49,137
And I'm sure
there's a real mutilation

265
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:51,142
out there to solve as we speak.

266
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:52,314
Something that screams

267
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:54,982
"crazed witchy woman
on a rampage" perhaps?

268
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:57,321
What? Not that I know of.

269
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:59,677
Okay, I'm gonna go
back in there.

270
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:00,686
Detective!

271
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:01,987
Just a doll.

272
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:04,358
I don't know what all
the fuss is about.

273
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:07,157
It's not just a doll;
it's manipulation.

274
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,490
What?
Trixie's best friend
landa got a new

275
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:11,496
all-american doll,
and now trixie wants one.

276
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:13,498
So what does she do?
She destroys her old doll,

277
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,500
expecting me to replace it.
Mm, impressive.

278
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:16,842
But, then, I'd
expect nothing less

279
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:18,337
from the shrewd
little minx.

280
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:21,008
Why don't you comply,
then we can get on, yes?
No.

281
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:23,677
And I'd appreciate it if you
don't undermine my authority.

282
00:12:23,677 --> 00:12:24,707
But you're being
a bad mother.

283
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:26,511
Abandon the child
in its time of need,

284
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:28,353
and it won't trust
you in the future.
(phone ringing)

285
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:30,178
is that what you
want, detective?
Decker.

286
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:31,723
(sighs)
yeah.

287
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:33,848
Got it.

288
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:35,724
New case. Hotel gleam.

289
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:38,092
Ah, finally!
Fantastic news.

290
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:44,055
He's practically a kid.

291
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:46,034
Yeah, 19 or so.

292
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:47,402
Chloe:
How long has he been here?

293
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,200
Ella: I don't know,
maybe a few days.

294
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:50,702
Guess the maid
really took

295
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:52,544
the "do not disturb"
sign seriously.

296
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:57,039
Cause of death: Single
puncture wound to the neck.

297
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:59,043
I'm thinking ice pick.

298
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:00,545
Or a screwdriver, perhaps.

299
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:01,877
Five-inch, phillips head?

300
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:03,382
Huh.

301
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:05,223
Yeah. Maybe.

302
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:06,548
You're good.

303
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:07,593
I know. Detective,

304
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:09,617
interesting pool of
blood through here.

305
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,430
I'm assuming it belongs
to cinderella here.

306
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:18,929
Cinderella? Sure we don't mean
evil stepmother?

307
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:21,232
Really?

308
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:23,904
Are we really still on the whole
"my mother did it" thing?

309
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:26,104
I thought she was responsible
for our last murder.

310
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:27,566
What, you're just throwing
homicides at her

311
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:29,574
until one sticks?
No, I'm simply saying

312
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:31,736
that the missing woman
may well be our killer.

313
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:33,945
A murderous psycho
whose rampage started

314
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:35,407
by impaling that poor lad.

315
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:38,075
Okay, my guess is that this
is an affair gone wrong.

316
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:41,254
Jealous husband follows
his cheating wife here.

317
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:43,424
He kills the young lover,
he wounds her,

318
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:45,763
and then he drags her home
or she escapes.

319
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:47,289
Definitely the latter.

320
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:48,594
(sighs) well, we would know more

321
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:50,085
if she had left
more than a shoe.

322
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:52,596
We don't have a purse.

323
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:54,299
No wallet, no keys.

324
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:56,271
Would the woman's phone help?

325
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:58,269
Well, yes, of course,
but we don't have...

326
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:00,001
A phone! (gasps)

327
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:04,112
wow!

328
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,680
Good eye, luce!

329
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,310
...Ifer.

330
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:10,445
I'll get this
back to the lab.

331
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,120
See if I can
restore it.

332
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:13,948
Yeah, fast as you can, ella;
we have to proceed

333
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:16,324
as if this missing woman
is still alive, okay?
Yeah.

334
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:18,123
I don't want to find
another body.

335
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:20,534
Trust me, you will not find
another body.

336
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:23,028
I found a body.

337
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,470
She's a maid at the hotel.

338
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,811
Explains why she didn't find
our dead guy.

339
00:14:33,807 --> 00:14:36,307
'cause, you know, she was dead.

340
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:38,139
Anyway, okay.

341
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:40,014
No open wounds, so she's
definitely not our cinderella

342
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:41,313
who bled all over the place.

343
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:42,654
You see the bruising

344
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:43,979
and the semi-circular
marks on her neck?

345
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:45,324
Strangled.
Lucifer: Aha.

346
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:47,988
Long fingernails,
which means the killer's female.

347
00:14:47,988 --> 00:14:49,988
Not necessarily.
I mean, the marks aren't deep.

348
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,320
It could just be a dude

349
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:53,164
who's not serious man-groomer.
Come on.

350
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,829
It's so obvious;
your cinder-hellion

351
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:57,328
had just plunged a screwdriver
into the poor lad,

352
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,660
when she was interrupted
by the chambermaid,

353
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:00,495
who she then snuffed out
with her bare hands.

354
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,530
Chloe:
Chambermaid?

355
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:02,834
Who's the killer, mrs. Peacock

356
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:04,196
in the library
with the candlestick?

357
00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:05,674
I love that game.

358
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:07,672
Dan: I really don't think
it's the missing woman, lucifer.

359
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:09,844
It's a little unusual
for a woman to strangle someone.

360
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:12,183
But look at the size of the
bruising; clearly not man hands.

361
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:14,848
I've seen some guys with
some pretty tiny lady hands.

362
00:15:14,848 --> 00:15:16,008
Dan doesn't count.

363
00:15:16,016 --> 00:15:17,176
Come on.
Chloe:
Okay, regardless,

364
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:19,023
the maid's death
wasn't planned.

365
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:21,349
I still think we're looking
at a third party--

366
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:24,364
someone attacking the couple
when the maid entered.

367
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:26,017
The killer then dragged the maid
into the bedroom,

368
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:27,686
where they struggled until<i> he</i>

369
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:29,864
finally managed
to strangle her.

370
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:31,703
Which gave our cinderella time
to get the hell out of there.

371
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:32,858
I couldn't agree less.

372
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:34,526
And she needs to go
straight<i> to</i> hell

373
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:35,874
as soon as possible.

374
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:38,869
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to make a call.

375
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:40,542
Oh, did we get anything
on that cell phone?

376
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,640
Oh, right! Uh, totally forgot.

377
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,240
No, no.

378
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:46,705
Could not recover anything
from the sim card.

379
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:48,753
Water and phones, bad news.

380
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:50,878
I dropped mine in the toilet
once-- that sucked.

381
00:15:50,884 --> 00:15:52,724
Damn. So much for that.
Had to reach in,
I didn't have my gloves.

382
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:54,049
Uh, no.

383
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:57,064
No, 'cause I did get
a serial number off of it,

384
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:59,217
so I know who bought it,
at least.

385
00:15:59,225 --> 00:16:01,225
Richards and wheeler.

386
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:02,727
High-end law firm
in beverly hills.

387
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:03,899
Cool.

388
00:16:03,897 --> 00:16:05,397
Next time, if you want,
you know,

389
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:08,398
you can just lead
with that information.

390
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:10,071
If you want.

391
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,900
Okay, boss,
where do you want me?

392
00:16:11,905 --> 00:16:14,065
I'm not your boss,
I'm just, you know, kind of...

393
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:15,574
My boss.

394
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:16,735
It's okay, chloe.

395
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:18,583
I've accepted my demotion
like a big boy.

396
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:20,848
And besides, it's kind of hot
when you give me orders.

397
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:24,078
Sorry.

398
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:25,924
Old habits.

399
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:28,089
Chloe: Why don't you start
with missing persons,

400
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:29,748
see if there are any new leads
on our cinderella.

401
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:32,256
Lucifer and I will go
to the law firm.

402
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:33,958
Okay.
Okay.

403
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,090
Lucifer.

404
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:36,825
Lucifer.
Hmm?

405
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:39,934
Oh. Uh, are you praying or...?

406
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:41,603
Yes. Usually works.

407
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:43,671
He must've gone for
a wank or something.

408
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:47,371
(sighs) come on,
amenadiel, where are you?

409
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,280
Hello?

410
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:53,948
Is this thing on?

411
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:56,607
I keep waiting for god
to talk back to me, too.

412
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:59,276
But you know what, don't
get discouraged, okay?

413
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:00,785
He is listening,
it's just

414
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:03,287
a one-way intercom kind of deal.

415
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:04,359
(slaps back)

416
00:17:09,129 --> 00:17:11,529
lucifer:<i> Come on, brother,</i>
<i>where are you?</i>

417
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,410
Linda.

418
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:27,984
Surprised to see
you're still coming in.

419
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:30,151
I mean, after all,
this is a...

420
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,650
A real facility for real
therapists with real patients.

421
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:35,153
Unfortunately, I can't
talk right now, linda.

422
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:37,155
I've got some
research to do.

423
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:38,187
Oh, sure, I bet.

424
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:40,491
Learning more
about psychiatry?

425
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:42,663
Or is it time to switch it up?
Be a lawyer maybe.

426
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:44,532
Astronaut.

427
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:45,861
I understand.

428
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:48,495
You're upset that I told you
I was a therapist.

429
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:52,001
Maybe you are one,
'cause your intuition's uncanny.

430
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:55,505
Linda, listen. I did
what I had to do, all right?

431
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:57,008
Now, you wouldn't
understand this,

432
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,840
but I was dealing with matters
of great importance.

433
00:17:58,845 --> 00:18:00,175
I didn't have a choice.

434
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,750
Yes, you did.

435
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:04,679
You used me.

436
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:08,194
You didn't have to do that.

437
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:12,018
I'm used to my patients
lying to me, not my colleagues.

438
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:14,855
Not my friends.

439
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:18,861
I confided in you, trusted you.

440
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:20,965
And you betrayed that trust.

441
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:24,369
It is difficult
to explain,

442
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:28,370
but things have been
very trying for me.

443
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:30,074
Mm-hmm.

444
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:32,206
Maybe if you didn't think
so much about yourself

445
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:34,882
and more about
how you treat others,

446
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:36,811
things wouldn't be so trying.

447
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:41,115
It's called karma.

448
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:44,462
Might want to research<i> that.</i>

449
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:04,782
All right, the most
effective way to do this

450
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:06,907
is with a discreet and
systematic approach.

451
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:07,913
Understood.

452
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:09,914
We can start with the
partners and then...

453
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,746
Lucifer:
Attention, lawyers! Hello!

454
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:14,592
Hello. Attention, please.

455
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:18,417
Uh, now, does anyone recognize
this critical piece of evidence

456
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:20,764
found at
a gruesome crime scene?

457
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,430
Yeah. See?

458
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:24,098
That's our
corporate-issue phone.

459
00:19:24,097 --> 00:19:25,257
We all have one.

460
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:26,595
That could be anybody's.

461
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,099
Right.

462
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:29,271
What about this

463
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:30,469
louboutin power pump

464
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,600
with the ombrÃ© finish
in a size, uh... Seven?

465
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:35,266
Six, u.K.
Lucifer...

466
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:36,605
Man:
Oh, my god.

467
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:38,439
Th-that's
charlotte's shoe.

468
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:40,614
Is she okay?

469
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:42,183
Prince charming, I presume.

470
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:45,779
Richards.
Charlotte richards.

471
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:47,285
She's the owner
of this firm.

472
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:49,447
When she didn't come
into the office, I just...

473
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:52,615
Assumed she was out of town
on a case.

474
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:55,525
Was this man involved in
any of those cases, by chance?

475
00:19:57,797 --> 00:19:59,797
Oh, my god, is he...?
Dead as a doornail.

476
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,969
Yes. Or in this
case, a door screw,

477
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:03,968
'cause the hole in his
neck's from a screwdriver.

478
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,800
And I happen to think that
charlotte may well have done...

479
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:08,305
Could provide us
with more...

480
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:10,638
Information on his death.

481
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:13,313
Well, I-I don't recognize him.

482
00:20:13,313 --> 00:20:15,483
Wait, does that mean
you think charlotte is alive?

483
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:16,481
Define "alive."

484
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:17,652
chloe:
When was the last time

485
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:18,750
you saw her?

486
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:27,588
(crying)

487
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:30,995
I did this!

488
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:32,657
Oh, charlotte, I'm so sorry!

489
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:34,165
All right, bradley,
listen up,

490
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:36,327
'cause I've got personal
trust issues at stake here.

491
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:38,066
Brad, look at me.

492
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,270
Did you want charlotte gone?

493
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:47,184
No. No.

494
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,850
That's the last thing I wanted.

495
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:51,178
Right. Then what do you desire?

496
00:20:51,184 --> 00:20:53,854
T-to be with charlotte.

497
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:55,353
We were in love.

498
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:57,355
Chloe:
Mr. Wheeler,

499
00:20:57,357 --> 00:21:02,687
um, would charlotte
maybe have, um...

500
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:05,195
Also... Slept with the guy
in the photo?

501
00:21:05,198 --> 00:21:06,358
No.

502
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:09,066
We were completely monogamous.

503
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:11,098
She wouldn't even sleep
with her own husband.

504
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:14,535
She was married already?

505
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,210
Yeah, but she hated that guy.

506
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:19,540
â™ª â™ª

507
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:22,045
â™ª nice to meet ya â™ª

508
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,378
â™ª I got to go â™ª

509
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:26,224
â™ª now you see me â™ª

510
00:21:26,219 --> 00:21:27,549
â™ª and now you don't... â™ª

511
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:29,553
sorry about the mess.

512
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:31,555
Lucifer: I'm sorry
about those shoes.

513
00:21:31,557 --> 00:21:33,057
Excuse me?

514
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:34,559
Mr. Richards,
when was the last time

515
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,730
your wife was home?

516
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:37,228
Oh, god, uh...

517
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,560
Three days ago, maybe.

518
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:41,395
You didn't file
a missing person's report?

519
00:21:41,401 --> 00:21:44,571
She's always traveling.
Doesn't always tell me when.

520
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:46,570
Did she tell you she was
bonking her associate bradley?

521
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:48,312
(whispers):
Lucifer.

522
00:21:49,242 --> 00:21:50,412
Did she?

523
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,440
I knew.

524
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:52,744
What could I do?

525
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:53,905
Well, one option
would be

526
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:55,483
to stab her in the neck
with a screwdriver.

527
00:21:56,449 --> 00:21:58,619
Do you recognize
this man?

528
00:21:58,618 --> 00:21:59,918
Oh, god.

529
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,589
Uh... H-he came by

530
00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:04,917
the house with a package
for charlotte, uh, last week.

531
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:06,424
Pretty sure it was,
like, a work thing.

532
00:22:06,426 --> 00:22:08,586
Well, it depends what kind
of package, doesn't it?

533
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:11,104
Uh, I-is charlotte all right?
Can you account

534
00:22:11,097 --> 00:22:12,757
for the last three days?
Yeah.

535
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:14,765
I've been up to my ears
in puke.

536
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:16,597
My kids are home sick.

537
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:19,442
Uh, I haven't left the house
since Monday.

538
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:21,109
And not showered
since, I see.

539
00:22:21,107 --> 00:22:22,767
Are your children home?

540
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:23,935
I'd like to confirm with them.

541
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:26,113
Yeah, sure.
Uh, just down the hall,

542
00:22:26,112 --> 00:22:28,782
and, uh, uh...

543
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:30,951
When exactly did you
surrender your manhood?

544
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,280
Excuse me?

545
00:22:32,285 --> 00:22:34,615
I mean, I'm all for
stay-at-home dads,

546
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,150
and believe me,
I personally commend you

547
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:37,785
for not abandoning
your children,

548
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,790
but that's still no reason
to give up.

549
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:42,132
Oh, I-I... I haven't
given up. I'm...

550
00:22:42,128 --> 00:22:44,798
Mr. Richards, you have
an entire slice of salami

551
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:46,557
stuck to your shirt.

552
00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:48,633
Oh, god.

553
00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:49,974
(sighs) come on.

554
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:51,469
Where's your closet?
Up here?

555
00:22:51,471 --> 00:22:52,801
Mm.

556
00:22:52,805 --> 00:22:54,635
Oh, goody.
They come in more colors.

557
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,470
There's only
one body part

558
00:22:56,476 --> 00:22:57,806
rubber should be worn on.
Oh!

559
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,140
Not that you'd know.

560
00:22:59,145 --> 00:23:00,805
You've clearly
castrated yourself.

561
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:02,813
But don't worry.
I'm here to help.

562
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:04,475
Hawaiian print?

563
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:06,984
The eighth deadly sin. Out.

564
00:23:06,986 --> 00:23:09,316
Dave matthews
tribute tank.

565
00:23:09,322 --> 00:23:11,492
Now I'm doubting
your sanity.

566
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:13,321
What have we got?
Ah! Here we go.

567
00:23:13,326 --> 00:23:15,326
This is more promising.

568
00:23:15,328 --> 00:23:16,828
Not worn since the...?

569
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:18,499
Wedding.
That's what I
thought, right.

570
00:23:18,498 --> 00:23:19,998
Let's have a look.

571
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:21,499
Come on.

572
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:23,771
Come on!

573
00:23:26,172 --> 00:23:28,672
Is that, uh...

574
00:23:28,674 --> 00:23:30,344
Cocaine!

575
00:23:30,343 --> 00:23:32,013
(laughs):
Oh, and the good stuff, as well.

576
00:23:32,011 --> 00:23:35,411
Ah, detective,
welcome to the party.

577
00:23:40,353 --> 00:23:41,893
Boy (over tv): Hey, mom,
the gang's here for lunch!

578
00:23:41,888 --> 00:23:43,348
Woman:
Ready in a minute.

579
00:23:43,356 --> 00:23:46,516
You know, feeding a whole
ball team isn't too big a job

580
00:23:46,526 --> 00:23:48,526
when you have macaroni
and cheese dinner handy.

581
00:23:48,528 --> 00:23:50,358
Okay, boys, come and get it!

582
00:23:50,363 --> 00:23:54,403
Mazikeen, what is this
strange gooey substance

583
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,700
that this boy is cooing about?

584
00:23:56,702 --> 00:23:58,872
Maze (in distance):
You watching porn?

585
00:23:58,871 --> 00:23:59,941
(groans)

586
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:07,882
what is this?

587
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,380
It's like money.

588
00:24:09,382 --> 00:24:12,552
Humans use it to buy
things they can't afford.

589
00:24:12,552 --> 00:24:13,882
(sighs) wish I'd found this

590
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:16,046
before I ate
out of those street bins.

591
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:17,215
(shudders)

592
00:24:17,223 --> 00:24:19,223
humans are silly animals,
aren't they?

593
00:24:19,225 --> 00:24:22,385
Weak. Fragile.

594
00:24:22,395 --> 00:24:23,985
That's what I'm counting on.

595
00:24:25,565 --> 00:24:28,725
Now... Where were we?

596
00:24:28,734 --> 00:24:30,574
(sighs)

597
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:32,640
(computer trilling)

598
00:24:38,578 --> 00:24:40,238
(whistles)

599
00:24:40,246 --> 00:24:42,406
that's a lot of coke.

600
00:24:42,415 --> 00:24:44,745
Think the attorney's
husband was dealing?

601
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,250
I don't think he's the
entrepreneurial type.

602
00:24:47,253 --> 00:24:49,093
Thinking maybe
the lawyer was.

603
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:51,258
Doesn't make a whole lot of
sense, but it would explain

604
00:24:51,257 --> 00:24:53,617
why she ended up bleeding
in that hotel room.

605
00:24:53,626 --> 00:24:57,086
Well, maybe the kid was
her street dealer or something.

606
00:24:57,096 --> 00:25:00,456
Yeah, maybe. Anyhow, ella got
a big fat print off the plastic.

607
00:25:00,466 --> 00:25:01,766
I'm running it
through afis now.

608
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:03,767
What's with the box?

609
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:05,139
Delivery for you.

610
00:25:05,137 --> 00:25:06,497
What?
Yeah.

611
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,940
Dan, I thought we
talked about this.

612
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:15,446
A united front,
especially now.

613
00:25:15,448 --> 00:25:17,618
Hey, don't look at me.

614
00:25:17,617 --> 00:25:18,947
Oh, she's here!
Lovely.

615
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:20,451
Did the mini kitchen
come, too?

616
00:25:20,453 --> 00:25:23,153
Lucifer, you shouldn't
have gotten her the doll.

617
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:24,615
It's fine.
You can say it's from you.

618
00:25:24,624 --> 00:25:26,124
(computer beeping)

619
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:27,785
lucifer:
Oh. Hello.

620
00:25:27,793 --> 00:25:29,663
Dan:
Luis mendoza.

621
00:25:29,662 --> 00:25:31,802
He's a known associate of
drug kingpin victor perez.

622
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:33,297
He's a scary dude.

623
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:34,629
Chloe:
Smart though,

624
00:25:34,634 --> 00:25:36,634
to partner up with a
high-powered defense attorney.

625
00:25:36,636 --> 00:25:39,136
Which would explain why
he's eluded the fbi for years.

626
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:40,968
I have a friend
in the bureau.

627
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:42,473
I'll call him, I'll see
what I can find out.

628
00:25:42,475 --> 00:25:43,805
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

629
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:46,809
Oh, look, she comes with an
adorable little chocolate cake.

630
00:25:46,812 --> 00:25:47,982
Your child's favorite.

631
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,580
I will deal with you later.

632
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:53,650
You're welcome.

633
00:25:53,653 --> 00:25:54,993
(sighs)

634
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:58,157
(clears throat)

635
00:25:58,157 --> 00:26:00,387
eeny meeny miney...

636
00:26:03,195 --> 00:26:06,195
(knives scraping)

637
00:26:06,198 --> 00:26:09,168
you are wasting
your time, mazikeen.

638
00:26:09,168 --> 00:26:10,498
You couldn't break me in hell.

639
00:26:10,503 --> 00:26:12,343
What makes you think
you could do it here?

640
00:26:12,338 --> 00:26:15,338
Maybe I couldn't hurt you
because you weren't human.

641
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:17,171
Well, now you are.

642
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:19,676
No, it's because I wasn't
guilty of anything.

643
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,179
Hell gives the damned
what they deserve.

644
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:24,551
I didn't deserve to be punished.

645
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,020
And you know it.

646
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:27,718
No.

647
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,690
I think it's because I just
didn't find your weak spot.

648
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:33,190
Everyone has one.

649
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:35,532
Human bodies
have several.

650
00:26:35,528 --> 00:26:37,028
Careful.

651
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:38,699
This body only heals once,

652
00:26:38,698 --> 00:26:40,858
and lucifer told you
not to harm me.

653
00:26:40,866 --> 00:26:44,196
You may have him confused
right now, but he's smart.

654
00:26:44,203 --> 00:26:48,043
He'll come around, see you
for who you really are.

655
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,370
A mother who loves her son.

656
00:26:50,376 --> 00:26:53,706
Loving mothers
don't abandon their sons.

657
00:26:53,713 --> 00:26:57,053
I threaten your relationship
with him, don't I?

658
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:58,549
(scoffs)

659
00:26:58,551 --> 00:27:00,051
nice try.

660
00:27:00,052 --> 00:27:01,892
(laughs)

661
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:04,217
even though you say
you're on your way out,

662
00:27:04,223 --> 00:27:06,723
you're still here
doing his bidding.

663
00:27:06,726 --> 00:27:08,056
You need him.

664
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,430
And if I stay,
then he won't need you.

665
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:12,729
Trust me,
you won't stay.

666
00:27:12,732 --> 00:27:15,902
Lucifer made a deal with your
ex to take you back to hell,

667
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:18,941
and he doesn't
break deals.

668
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:21,638
Don't think he'd start with god.

669
00:27:22,742 --> 00:27:24,682
He made a deal?

670
00:27:25,745 --> 00:27:27,805
Wait.

671
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:34,154
Is that a weak spot?

672
00:27:38,591 --> 00:27:41,991
Are those... Tears?

673
00:27:43,763 --> 00:27:45,963
(grunts)

674
00:27:45,965 --> 00:27:48,665
oh!

675
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:52,970
You're a bad mother.

676
00:27:52,972 --> 00:27:55,812
Really? I think you might
be projecting a little bit.

677
00:27:55,808 --> 00:27:57,438
(chuckles):
Oh, really? How's that?

678
00:27:57,443 --> 00:28:00,283
Well, you keep trying to pin
murders on your own mother.

679
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:03,149
I'm guessing you and her don't
have the best relationship.

680
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:04,949
There.

681
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:07,820
At least I get to keep
the cute little chocolate cake.

682
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,450
Oh, come on.

683
00:28:09,455 --> 00:28:10,985
Talked to agent colburn.

684
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,290
Charlotte wasn't working
<i>for</i> the cartel.

685
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:13,621
She was working
to bring it down.

686
00:28:13,626 --> 00:28:15,456
So was that poor kid.

687
00:28:15,461 --> 00:28:17,291
His name's marco sanchez.
Got in over his head

688
00:28:17,296 --> 00:28:19,296
with the cartel,
was trying to make it right.

689
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:22,498
So he was working with charlotte
and the fbi as an informant?

690
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:24,471
Trying to build a case
against perez, yeah.

691
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:27,340
That's why he and charlotte were
meeting at the hotel in secret.

692
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:28,509
But look at this.

693
00:28:28,507 --> 00:28:32,137
Perez's hit man is
jimmy the carpenter.

694
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:34,814
Want to take a guess
at his m.O.?

695
00:28:34,814 --> 00:28:36,654
Screwdriver?
Boom.

696
00:28:36,649 --> 00:28:40,149
So the woman<i> isn't</i> a
ball of homicidal fury.

697
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:42,152
Chloe:
No. Perez is.

698
00:28:42,154 --> 00:28:44,154
Or his hit man anyway.
Lucifer: Right.

699
00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:46,316
Well, shall we arrest
the perez chap, then?
The fbi has been

700
00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:47,515
trying to do that for years.

701
00:28:47,526 --> 00:28:48,656
He's teflon. He launders

702
00:28:48,661 --> 00:28:50,331
everything through
his tanning salon franchise.

703
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:52,859
Yeah, we can't risk
derailing the fbi's case.

704
00:28:52,865 --> 00:28:55,365
We have to go through the court,
and we have to get a warrant.

705
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:56,527
I'll see if
I can rush one.

706
00:28:56,535 --> 00:28:57,835
Perez could have
charlotte now.

707
00:28:57,837 --> 00:28:59,667
Ah, I doubt it.

708
00:28:59,672 --> 00:29:01,672
Well, if not,
he's after her.

709
00:29:01,674 --> 00:29:03,344
I don't doubt that.

710
00:29:03,342 --> 00:29:05,512
Yeah, why don't you stay here
and get the warrant.

711
00:29:05,511 --> 00:29:07,011
I think I've left
the cooker on.

712
00:29:07,012 --> 00:29:09,882
<i>(elevator bell dings)</i>

713
00:29:09,882 --> 00:29:12,052
ah, lovely. You
got one on the go.

714
00:29:12,051 --> 00:29:14,181
Right. New
information, maze.

715
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:17,186
Seems mum might not be a lying
sack of savagery after all,

716
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:19,059
but it also seems
that she's the target

717
00:29:19,058 --> 00:29:21,188
of a vicious
cartel hit man.

718
00:29:21,193 --> 00:29:23,233
So you mustn't let her
leave the penthouse

719
00:29:23,229 --> 00:29:25,259
until this whole mess
is resolved. Right-o?

720
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:28,365
Your mom's gone.

721
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:29,897
What?

722
00:29:29,902 --> 00:29:32,372
Well, how did that happen, maze?

723
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:33,701
She tricked me,

724
00:29:33,706 --> 00:29:36,566
then head-butted me, then left.

725
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:38,375
(sighs)

726
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:39,877
sorry.

727
00:29:39,879 --> 00:29:41,879
Oh, well.

728
00:29:41,881 --> 00:29:43,911
Suppose the worst
that could happen

729
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:46,216
is that she's brutally murdered.

730
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:48,388
If so, she'll just find
a new body

731
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:51,047
and run right back
like a good mum, yeah?

732
00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:52,216
Or not.

733
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:54,064
I may have let

734
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,729
the whole deal
with god thing slip.

735
00:29:56,729 --> 00:29:58,929
So I think
she might be running away.

736
00:29:58,931 --> 00:30:01,801
So if she goes into a new
body, we'll never find her.

737
00:30:03,569 --> 00:30:06,939
Okay. Then we'll just have
to find her before that happens.

738
00:30:06,939 --> 00:30:09,569
I mean, how far can
a celestial being

739
00:30:09,575 --> 00:30:12,405
trapped in a feeble human body
for the first time get?

740
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:13,581
Well, let's see.

741
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:16,249
She's stupid hot,
wearing my clothes,

742
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:18,148
and she's got
a corporate credit card.

743
00:30:21,754 --> 00:30:22,854
Bollocks.

744
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:29,589
Hello, chaps. Just looking for
the head of a big drug cartel.

745
00:30:29,595 --> 00:30:31,755
Is he home? Vicky?

746
00:30:31,764 --> 00:30:34,304
Victor?

747
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,270
Oh!
Oh. Sorry, love. Vicky!

748
00:30:36,268 --> 00:30:38,098
(man shouts)
ah.

749
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:39,643
(laughs)

750
00:30:39,638 --> 00:30:42,438
ah. Hello.

751
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:43,771
Mr. Perez,
I need you to know

752
00:30:43,776 --> 00:30:45,436
that I'm not here
to talk to you

753
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:46,614
about your criminal
drug enterprise.

754
00:30:46,612 --> 00:30:48,012
I'm here about
charlotte richards.

755
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:53,615
Are you, by chance,
holding charlotte prisoner?

756
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:55,449
Who?
Right. I'll take that as a no.

757
00:30:55,454 --> 00:30:57,454
Here's my point.
(groaning)

758
00:30:57,456 --> 00:30:59,116
you may think that she's dead,
but she's not,

759
00:30:59,124 --> 00:31:00,464
which is fine,
because you also think

760
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:02,129
that she's still charlotte,
which she's also not.

761
00:31:02,127 --> 00:31:03,627
Is that clear?
Ow!

762
00:31:03,629 --> 00:31:05,459
I simply need you
to promise

763
00:31:05,464 --> 00:31:07,534
to stay away
from charlotte richards. Deal?

764
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:15,839
Oh. Oh, look at that.

765
00:31:15,841 --> 00:31:19,881
Snowstorm in a tanning salon.
How ironic.

766
00:31:21,981 --> 00:31:24,151
Oh. Detective.

767
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:26,479
I think vicky here is ready for
a little bit of show-and-tell.

768
00:31:26,485 --> 00:31:28,145
Emphasis on the show.

769
00:31:28,153 --> 00:31:29,823
(shouts)

770
00:31:29,822 --> 00:31:31,992
â™ª â™ª

771
00:31:31,991 --> 00:31:33,661
victor (chuckles):
<i>Wait a second.</i>

772
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:36,159
You think I had him killed
'cause he's a narc?

773
00:31:36,161 --> 00:31:37,661
Why would I do that?

774
00:31:37,663 --> 00:31:39,003
I was using him.

775
00:31:38,998 --> 00:31:41,498
Fed him bogus information
on purpose.

776
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,530
Had the fbi chasing
after their own knobs.

777
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:46,366
Kid was an asset.

778
00:31:46,372 --> 00:31:48,512
Be stupid to hurt him.

779
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:50,507
Well, you forgot to tell
your buddy jimmy the plan.

780
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:52,839
Screwdriver
to the neck.

781
00:31:52,845 --> 00:31:55,605
The carpenter? He's dead.

782
00:31:57,182 --> 00:32:00,022
Oh. Did I throw a wrench
in your works?

783
00:32:00,019 --> 00:32:02,719
Get it? Screwdriver? Wrench?

784
00:32:02,721 --> 00:32:04,051
It's a whole theme.

785
00:32:04,056 --> 00:32:05,116
(laughing)

786
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:10,029
ah. How's my little
drug kingpin panini?

787
00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:12,029
Not our guy.

788
00:32:12,031 --> 00:32:14,361
We have to find someone
connected to marco and charlotte

789
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:16,196
that didn't know
jimmy the carpenter's dead.

790
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:18,541
Well, jimmy's dead?
Tragic.

791
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:22,037
So assuming the whole cartel
knows that, it rules them out

792
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:24,541
and points us
to the only way

793
00:32:24,543 --> 00:32:26,543
that charlotte and marco
are connected:

794
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:29,045
The law firm.

795
00:32:29,048 --> 00:32:30,878
Two shakedowns in one day.
I'm in.

796
00:32:30,883 --> 00:32:33,223
No more shakedowns, no more
tanning booth shenanigans.

797
00:32:33,218 --> 00:32:35,548
You and I have been working
together long enough

798
00:32:35,554 --> 00:32:37,554
for you to know
how to follow protocol.

799
00:32:37,556 --> 00:32:39,556
I'm sorry, detective,
but charlotte's in danger.

800
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:41,388
We need to find her.

801
00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:44,233
How did she go from big bad
wolf to little lost lamb?

802
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:46,229
Well, maybe she's a wolf
in sheep's clothing,

803
00:32:46,231 --> 00:32:49,471
but right now she needs
to return to the flock.

804
00:32:54,073 --> 00:32:55,743
Yeah, I worked
on that case.

805
00:32:55,741 --> 00:32:57,611
I work on every case
that comes through here.

806
00:32:57,609 --> 00:32:59,779
Okay, but the perez case
was sensitive.

807
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:01,238
You were the only one here

808
00:33:01,246 --> 00:33:02,746
besides charlotte
who knew about it.

809
00:33:02,748 --> 00:33:04,578
Which means you're also

810
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:06,083
the only one here who was aware

811
00:33:06,085 --> 00:33:07,915
of jimmy the carpenter's
methodology.

812
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,250
Wait. You don't think that I...

813
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:12,255
Got handy with
a screwdriver

814
00:33:12,257 --> 00:33:15,087
and tried to pin it
on the perez cartel?

815
00:33:15,094 --> 00:33:17,094
Yes.
(chuckles) that's insane.

816
00:33:17,096 --> 00:33:18,296
Chloe:
What's insane is

817
00:33:18,297 --> 00:33:19,927
a guy with
a harvard law degree

818
00:33:19,932 --> 00:33:21,432
still working as an associate.

819
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:24,773
Lucifer:
Yes. Passed up for partner
by old tom cruise out there.

820
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:27,800
Guess you should've been
slipping the boss your top gun.

821
00:33:27,806 --> 00:33:29,936
If you're suggesting
that I killed

822
00:33:29,942 --> 00:33:34,282
an innocent kid and my boss--
my mentor of 12 years--

823
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:38,449
all out of professional
jealousy, you're crazy.

824
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,950
Hold on.

825
00:33:39,952 --> 00:33:42,122
I don't believe that
we mentioned two murders.

826
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:44,291
I mean, we showed you the
crime scene photo of marco,

827
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:46,459
but not charlotte.
Lucifer...

828
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:49,958
Well, given the information
that you presented--

829
00:33:49,962 --> 00:33:53,462
the phone, the shoe--
I just assumed that she was...

830
00:33:53,465 --> 00:33:55,165
Dead? No.

831
00:33:55,167 --> 00:33:58,137
Just missing. And if we find
her alive, it's gonna be

832
00:33:58,137 --> 00:34:00,637
very interesting to hear
what she has to say about you,

833
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:02,309
her loyal protÃ©gÃ©.

834
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:05,477
This line of questioning
is now over.

835
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:06,977
Why don't you go
speak to my attorney.

836
00:34:06,979 --> 00:34:09,979
He's two doors down.

837
00:34:09,982 --> 00:34:13,322
Why would you divulge
privileged information to a guy

838
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:15,318
who's now clearly
our lead suspect?

839
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,920
Sorry. I'll get that
protocol thing down one day.

840
00:34:20,826 --> 00:34:23,826
â™ª â™ª

841
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:25,999
â™ª where's the justice â™ª

842
00:34:25,998 --> 00:34:28,998
â™ª I don't know â™ª

843
00:34:29,001 --> 00:34:31,841
â™ª I've got a fever â™ª

844
00:34:31,837 --> 00:34:35,907
â™ª and it's criminal. â™ª

845
00:34:43,882 --> 00:34:45,552
why aren't you dead?

846
00:34:45,551 --> 00:34:47,221
What? Who are you?

847
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:48,549
Don't give me that, charlotte.

848
00:34:48,554 --> 00:34:50,224
By the way,
thanks for using

849
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:52,392
the credit card we opened
for the perez case.

850
00:34:52,391 --> 00:34:54,221
Did you forget I'm the only one
that has access to it?

851
00:34:54,226 --> 00:34:55,386
That I'm the only one

852
00:34:55,394 --> 00:34:57,564
who did anything for you
at that hellhole?

853
00:34:57,563 --> 00:35:00,233
Hellhole? Are you a demon, too?

854
00:35:00,232 --> 00:35:01,402
Why?

855
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,070
Because I'm a little upset?

856
00:35:03,068 --> 00:35:05,768
Wouldn't you be, too,
if you got passed up by wheeler

857
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:07,441
with the big wiener?

858
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,739
Oh, I know who you are now.
You're the one who killed me.

859
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:11,581
Well, apparently not.
But I am now.

860
00:35:11,577 --> 00:35:13,577
Sorry.
(grunts)

861
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:15,409
can't kill my mum.
Oh!

862
00:35:15,414 --> 00:35:16,584
Lucifer!

863
00:35:16,582 --> 00:35:18,082
Detective.

864
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:20,083
If you're gonna
follow me following him,

865
00:35:20,085 --> 00:35:21,815
we should have just
drove together.

866
00:35:24,256 --> 00:35:27,086
Right, you get
him, detective!

867
00:35:27,092 --> 00:35:29,432
I'll stay here
and protect the poor lady!

868
00:35:29,428 --> 00:35:31,158
Protect<i> me?</i>
From what?

869
00:35:32,431 --> 00:35:33,931
Ow!

870
00:35:33,932 --> 00:35:35,272
What'd you do that for?

871
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:36,767
Well, the detective
knows you're alive now,

872
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:38,798
so you're gonna have to sell
the whole charlotte charade.

873
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:40,774
Need to explain
that blood pool somehow.

874
00:35:40,772 --> 00:35:42,942
Oh, you little...
Devil?

875
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:44,941
Yes. But about that--

876
00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:47,443
we've never met until now,
don't know each other.

877
00:35:47,446 --> 00:35:50,346
I fear it's too much for
the detective to handle.

878
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:56,151
Well, it looks like she can
handle quite a bit.

879
00:35:56,155 --> 00:35:57,985
Yeah.

880
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:58,990
(chuckles)

881
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:01,631
(handcuffs clicking)

882
00:36:01,627 --> 00:36:03,527
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

883
00:36:06,632 --> 00:36:08,302
(sighs)

884
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,300
well, it seems that wound was
re-aggravated in all the hubbub.

885
00:36:11,303 --> 00:36:12,643
Poor woman.

886
00:36:12,638 --> 00:36:14,968
You want to tell me
what the hell you were doing?

887
00:36:14,973 --> 00:36:16,813
Well, leading the mouse
to the cheese, of course.

888
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:18,638
I mean, I was
gonna be the cat,

889
00:36:18,644 --> 00:36:22,484
but then you showed up, so I
suppose that makes you the dog.

890
00:36:22,481 --> 00:36:24,311
What am I gonna do with you?

891
00:36:24,316 --> 00:36:25,816
Well, I can
think of a few things.

892
00:36:25,817 --> 00:36:27,647
Might need
a stretch first though.

893
00:36:27,653 --> 00:36:28,993
You need to follow the rules.

894
00:36:28,987 --> 00:36:31,187
You tell me not to ravage
suspects in front of you.

895
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,160
Now I can't do it
behind your back either?

896
00:36:33,158 --> 00:36:35,158
I mean, make your mind up,
detective.

897
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,160
No more buying
my daughter $200 dolls.

898
00:36:37,162 --> 00:36:39,332
Well, why not?
You weren't going to.

899
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:42,171
I was teaching her a lesson.

900
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:44,167
Neglect 101.
You're abandoning her

901
00:36:44,169 --> 00:36:45,739
in her time of
need, detective.

902
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:55,180
I don't know what happened
between you and your mother.

903
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:58,010
And if you ever want to talk
about it, I'm here for you.

904
00:36:58,016 --> 00:36:59,346
But listen to me.

905
00:36:59,351 --> 00:37:00,851
Doing what's best
for your child--

906
00:37:00,852 --> 00:37:04,252
it doesn't always
make 'em happy.

907
00:37:13,365 --> 00:37:15,195
(door opens)

908
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,040
I hate to interrupt
so late, but, uh...

909
00:37:19,037 --> 00:37:21,367
I just wanted to apologize.

910
00:37:21,373 --> 00:37:22,543
Oh?

911
00:37:22,541 --> 00:37:24,541
Yeah, you were
right, linda.

912
00:37:24,543 --> 00:37:28,043
You see, I really do
have a lot to atone for.

913
00:37:28,046 --> 00:37:32,546
I've... Made so many
mistakes lately.

914
00:37:32,551 --> 00:37:34,381
But a big one was hurting you.

915
00:37:34,386 --> 00:37:36,386
I may have forged
a friendship with you

916
00:37:36,388 --> 00:37:38,888
under false pretenses, yes.

917
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:42,890
But I did consider you a friend.

918
00:37:42,894 --> 00:37:45,334
And I'm deeply sorry
that I ruined that.

919
00:37:48,734 --> 00:37:52,074
If anyone understands mistakes,
it's a therapist.

920
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:55,110
Not that you'd know.

921
00:37:55,107 --> 00:37:57,107
(chuckles)

922
00:37:57,109 --> 00:37:58,409
(sighs)

923
00:37:58,410 --> 00:37:59,980
apology accepted.

924
00:38:01,413 --> 00:38:02,913
Thank you.

925
00:38:02,914 --> 00:38:04,914
Night.

926
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:06,816
Good night.

927
00:38:09,421 --> 00:38:10,591
(door closes)

928
00:38:10,589 --> 00:38:12,259
(sighs)

929
00:38:12,257 --> 00:38:16,757
â™ª oh, no more apologies â™ª

930
00:38:16,762 --> 00:38:19,332
â™ª need be exchange â™ª

931
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:25,936
â™ª oh, no words could ever help â™ª

932
00:38:25,937 --> 00:38:27,997
â™ª relieve this pain â™ª

933
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:35,110
â™ª easier to live with pain â™ª

934
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:38,013
â™ª than have to let it go â™ª

935
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:45,286
â™ª oh, oh-oh, oh-oh,
oh, oh-oh, oh-oh â™ª

936
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:48,360
â™ª oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh â™ª

937
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:54,455
â™ª oh, oh-oh, oh-oh,
oh, oh-oh, oh-oh... â™ª

938
00:38:54,466 --> 00:38:55,866
(sighs)

939
00:38:57,302 --> 00:39:00,542
(yells)

940
00:39:02,474 --> 00:39:04,544
(elevator bell dings)

941
00:39:16,355 --> 00:39:18,385
(clears throat)

942
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,830
what on earth is that?

943
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:25,499
Cheesy noodles.

944
00:39:25,497 --> 00:39:28,727
It's what mothers make
to bring their children joy.

945
00:39:29,835 --> 00:39:32,835
I saw it on the flat-screen.

946
00:39:32,838 --> 00:39:34,238
(chuckles softly)

947
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:37,067
that explains all the cheese.

948
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,510
Lucifer...

949
00:39:43,515 --> 00:39:47,175
I wish, with all my being,

950
00:39:47,185 --> 00:39:50,345
that things could go back
to the way things were.

951
00:39:50,355 --> 00:39:53,185
With you...

952
00:39:53,191 --> 00:39:56,091
And all my children
again in heaven.

953
00:39:59,364 --> 00:40:03,074
I want what your father
took from me.

954
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:05,938
I want my home back.

955
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:14,205
But I know that's not possible.

956
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:16,882
So I want to do what I can

957
00:40:16,882 --> 00:40:21,952
to be a good mother
to you here, on earth.

958
00:40:30,562 --> 00:40:32,462
It's too late.

959
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,570
You abandoned me, mum.

960
00:40:37,569 --> 00:40:41,569
You just stood by and watched
as I was cast out.

961
00:40:41,573 --> 00:40:45,483
Thrown into hell
and vilified for all eternity.

962
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:50,249
There aren't enough
cheesy noodles in the universe

963
00:40:50,248 --> 00:40:52,148
to fix all that, I'm afraid.

964
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:58,918
Okay.

965
00:40:58,924 --> 00:41:00,824
(thunder rumbling softly)

966
00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:13,199
your father never
sent you to hell.

967
00:41:15,273 --> 00:41:18,113
I did.

968
00:41:18,109 --> 00:41:20,509
Oh, great. Much better.

969
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,780
I did it to save your life.

970
00:41:24,783 --> 00:41:29,293
After the rebellion,
your father was angry.

971
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:31,687
Deeply angry.

972
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,660
He wanted to
destroy you.

973
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:41,302
I begged him not to.

974
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:45,569
<i>I</i> asked him to send
you to hell instead.

975
00:41:46,805 --> 00:41:50,535
I did it because
I love you, son.

976
00:41:51,643 --> 00:41:54,643
And I always will.

977
00:41:54,646 --> 00:41:57,476
However...

978
00:41:57,482 --> 00:42:00,322
If you still need me

979
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:02,918
to return me to hell,
I understand.

980
00:42:04,823 --> 00:42:06,993
You do what is
right for you.

981
00:42:06,992 --> 00:42:09,492
(chuckles)

982
00:42:09,494 --> 00:42:11,334
that's very gracious
of you, mother.

983
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:12,659
(chuckles)

984
00:42:12,664 --> 00:42:14,664
okay, but please don't
send me back to hell.

985
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:16,596
(both chuckle)

986
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:21,570
but I meant the rest.

987
00:42:23,508 --> 00:42:25,908
I know you did.

988
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:29,179
All right.

989
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,850
All right,
you can stay.

990
00:42:30,849 --> 00:42:32,849
For now.

991
00:42:32,851 --> 00:42:35,021
Just until I...

992
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:37,350
Figure out what I need to do.

993
00:42:37,355 --> 00:42:39,685
Thank you, son.

994
00:42:39,691 --> 00:42:41,421
Yeah.

995
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:52,765
(laughs softly)

996
00:42:59,411 --> 00:43:01,441
â™ª â™ª

997
00:43:04,549 --> 00:43:10,889
â™ª so I'm gonna live my life
like it's my last damn night â™ª

998
00:43:10,889 --> 00:43:14,219
â™ª 'cause when the clock
strikes 12:00 â™ª

999
00:43:14,225 --> 00:43:15,785
â™ª we're all gonna go to hell. â™ª
