             Seriously. Tell me,

2
00:00:02,937 --> 00:00:04,636
what do you actually want?
My father was a cop.

3
00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:07,006
He was a great cop.
I really do want to help people.

4
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:08,574
She starred
    in<i> Hot Tub High School.</i>

5
00:00:08,576 --> 00:00:10,743
And two weeks later,
        her father died.

DAN:
     <i> You were right before.</i>

7
00:00:11,912 --> 00:00:14,079
We've been living in
          the past for too long.

8
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:15,080
It's time we get a divorce.

where I fit in in this world.

11
00:00:17,585 --> 00:00:19,118
So, we're still good
     to be roomies, right?

LINDA:
           <i> I need you</i>

about who you are.

15
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:23,989
No more lies.

You can't rush perfection.

25
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:50,949
This is true.

26
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:51,950
Hawaiian bread.

00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:12,137
I hear there's some funny
business about 15 minutes in...

37
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:13,739
Oh, you mean that scene where...
               Yeah, yeah, yeah.

38
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,507
Let's not finish that thought.

39
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,409
Just tell her

40
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:18,410
it was a good movie.

41

00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,579
Yeah, I know.

00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:23,348

Not a good time, Lucifer.
                         Agreed.

63
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:22,307
It's a horrible time.

64
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:25,043
Dr. Linda just
            canceled my session.

65
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:26,078
She won't take my calls.

66
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,279
I think I...

67
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:28,881
truly scared her off.

68
00:02:28,883 --> 00:02:30,549
Something happened
       with your shrink?

69
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:31,550
Yes...

70
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,318
and it's all your fault.

71
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,220
I mean, you're the one
who suggested I open up to her.

72
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:37,089
Well, smashing advice,
           Detective.

73
00:02:37,091 --> 00:02:38,790
I don't have time
      for this right now.

74
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:40,626
What, do we have a case?

75
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:41,727
I'm dealing with my own issues.

76
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:42,728
Oh!

77
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:43,729
Even better.
              Let's solve those,

78
00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:44,963
shall we?
Lucifer, stop!

79
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:48,734
I'm sorry, but there is no way

80
00:02:48,736 --> 00:02:50,202
that you can help me right now.

81
00:02:50,204 --> 00:02:52,804
You're just... you're too you.

82
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:55,274
Oh.

83
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:57,843
Yes, you're right, Detective.

84
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:00,312
Being me seems to be a problem,
          doesn't it?

85
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:03,582
Everywhere I go,
       someone gets hurt.

86
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:06,018
Well, clearly, I need to be
        Not-Me instead.

87
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,820
Someone... better, more helpful.

88
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:10,289
More boring.

89
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:11,290
DAN:
                         Okay...

90
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:13,859
got you a hot,
soy latte, extra foam.

91
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,961
Thank you.

92
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:17,062
You okay, Chloe?

93
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:19,898
Mm-hmm.
           All good.

94
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,634
Just on my way out.

95
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:25,938
Something's seriously
                  bothering her.

96
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,539
Hmm?

97
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,242
Oh, I hadn't noticed.

98
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:34,079
But you did.

99
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:41,220

100
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:43,055
CHLOE:
   <i> This isn't right, Warden.</i>

101
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:45,624
Joe Fields is a convicted
    murderer, a cop killer.

102
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:47,426
You're letting him
      off on family leave?

103
00:03:47,428 --> 00:03:49,328
Detective,
   I understand how you feel.

104
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:53,432
Oh, respectfully, there is no
 way you understand how I feel.

105
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:54,733
I'm sorry.

106
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,069
I know it's your father
  we're talking about, but...

107
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:58,103
this wasn't my call.

108
00:03:58,105 --> 00:03:59,504
Fields has been

109
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:01,773
a model prisoner
       for over a decade.

110
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:03,742
He lobbied the Prisoner's
Rights Board and they said yes.

111
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,377
What's he gonna do
        with his leave?

112
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:07,112
Go destroy another family?

113
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:08,747
It's for his granddaughter's
          christening.

114
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,882
My dad never got to go to his
  granddaughter's christening.

115
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:12,584
Where is the justice in that?

116
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,219
I'm sorry, Detective.

117
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:15,320
I wish there was something
          we could do.

118
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:18,090
(sighs)

119
00:04:23,998 --> 00:04:26,531

121
00:04:27,568 --> 00:04:28,834
Uh... Decker.

122
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:29,968
LUCIFER:
         Ah, Detective!

123
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,236
I think I may have found a way

124
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:32,337
to make myself useful.

125
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:33,605
What? It's not a good time,
            Lucifer.

126
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,608
What if I told you
   I wasn't Lucifer anymore?

127
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,809
What?

128
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,011
I've decided to try

129
00:04:39,013 --> 00:04:41,380
and walk a mile
    in another man's shoes.

130
00:04:41,382 --> 00:04:43,348
See the world from
a different perspective.

131
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,716
I'm going to learn

132
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:46,385
how to Douche.

133
00:04:46,387 --> 00:04:48,620
I... may have to rephrase
           that one.

134
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,689
But do I have your permission
    to follow Daniel and...

135
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:51,690
Yeah, do whatever.

136
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:53,292
I got to go.

137
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,529
Hello?

138
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,465
I'll take that as a yes.

139
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:01,933
DAN: Yeah, I'm just
              following up on...

140
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:07,639
Uh, yeah.

141
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:23,955

Joe Fields.

143
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,442
Come out.

144
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:45,544
You're not gonna
      get away with this.

145
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,350
Joe Fields...

146
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:01,460
¶ ¶

147
00:06:10,471 --> 00:06:11,870
I still don't get it, man.

148
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,572
Why the hell are you following
   me around all of a sudden?

149
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:14,606
Because I want to learn

150
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:16,041
what it's like
to be you, Daniel.

151
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:18,343
Your approach
to life intrigues me.
           (laughs dryly)

152
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:19,945
This from the guy who punched me
          in the face?

153
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:21,346
That was last week.

154
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:22,948
Anyway, the detective
already agreed to it.

155
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,350
You're the department bottom,
 so you have to do as she says.

156
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:26,451
What's this really about?

157
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:27,686
(sighs)

158
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:29,121
Look, people like you.

159
00:06:29,123 --> 00:06:32,157
They find you helpful, like duct
tape or a trusty socket wrench.

160
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:35,160
I want you to teach
                 me your secret.

161
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:36,762
I want you to show me
       how to be a tool.

162
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:39,965
You should stay out of the way.

163
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:40,999
Follow my lead.

164
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:42,667
I call all the shots,
        you understand?

165
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:45,303
This feels like something that
  you would agree to, so yes.

166
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,741
What do we got?

167
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,110
Three gunshot victims,
shot execution style.

168
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:53,712
The van driver
got a single bullet

169
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:55,981
to the neck,
   guard got one to the head.

170
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:58,583
The prisoner got a double tap
         to the chest.

171
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,552
Prisoner's name is Joe Fields.

172
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:01,553
Wait a minute,<i> the</i> Joe Fields?

173
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:02,554
CHLOE: Yeah.
                        As in...

174
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:04,456
The guy that killed my father.

175
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,291
They targeted him

176
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:08,260
while he was vulnerable.
      This was a hit, Dan.

177
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:09,828
ELLA:
W-Wait a second.

178
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,297
The guy who killed your dad
       was just murdered

179
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:13,565
and you caught the case?

180
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:14,933
Yeah.

181
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,002
That is totally messed up.

182
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:18,003
Mm-hmm.

183
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:19,171
Are you okay?

184
00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:20,939
Yeah, I'm fine.
                  LUCIFER: Fine?

185
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,374
You should be ecstatic.

186
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:24,109
(laughs): Your father's
                 killer just got

187
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,210
the ultimate punishment.

188
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:29,314
Who was first
on the scene?

189
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:30,315
It was me.

190
00:07:31,485 --> 00:07:32,951
I made the call.

191
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:37,289
DAN:
       <i> You followed him?</i>

192
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,024
Yeah. I know this looks bad.

193
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:40,559
You stalked your
father's murderer

194
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:41,760
right before
he was killed.

195
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:43,795
That was a terrible move,
           Detective.

196
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,230
It was, right?

197
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:47,799
What were you planning to do,
             Chloe?

198
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,034
Crash the christening?

199
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:50,368
I don't know, Dan!

200
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,503
I was angry.

201
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:52,904
The guy killed my father.

202
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:54,206
He had the nerve

203
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,041
to smile at me.
      Do you have any idea

204
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:57,042
what that feels like?

205
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:58,810
No.

206
00:07:58,812 --> 00:07:59,878
No, I don't.

207
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:03,114
But you still shouldn't
have followed him.

208
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:05,450
No one actually thinks
that you did this,

209
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:06,618
but you know what
it looks like, right?

210
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,653
Yes, I do.

211
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:09,821
That's why I'm gonna step away
         from the case.

212
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,923
It's a massive
     conflict of interest.

213
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:13,825
Don't worry, Chloe.
I'm gonna stay on this.

214
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,160
Yes, Detective Dan and I

215
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:16,761
won't rest until
            we catch the killer.

216
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:18,864
I don't think that it's
         a good idea for Lucifer

217
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:19,865
to be part of this case.

218
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:21,266
I agree.

219
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:23,969
I mean, the last thing this
    case needs is a loose canon.

220
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:25,937
She needs someone like you.
          A reliable,

221
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:28,039
helpful, boring
                      detective.

222
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,474
Now, the good news is
     that's me as well now.

223
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:30,542
So, the Dans are on the case.

224
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:32,444
Can't you take
    anything seriously, man?

225
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:33,678
I assure you

226
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,313
I'm taking this
                 very seriously.
Oh, really?

227
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:36,615
Well, you're doing a great job
        of showing that.
                           Guys.

228
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:40,318
It would mean a lot to me
if you worked together on this.

229
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,153
Hmm.

230
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:43,255
Of course, Chloe.

231
00:08:43,257 --> 00:08:44,489
Okay, so...

232
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:45,924
whoa,

233
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:47,259
this looks heavy.

234
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:50,295
Like waiting-for-STD-results
             heavy.

235
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:51,596
(whispering):
     I can come back later.

236
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:53,532
Oh, no, it's fine.
          What is it?

237
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:55,433
Okay, so, I went through
  all the prints from the van.

238
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:57,235
Okay? And all of them cleared
      as prison personnel

239
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:59,170
except for an ex-con

240
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:01,039
named Rodney Lam.

241
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,774
And get this...

242
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:04,009
he served time

243
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:06,144
with Joe Fields.

244
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:07,779
We're on it.

245
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:08,780
We're on it.

246
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:10,916
Nice.

247
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:12,517
You working on a new role?

248
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,518
Hmm?

249
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,654
(scoffs)

250
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,594
You're wearing that
                to an interview?

251
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:23,762
What's the job?

252
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:24,896
Preschool aide.

253
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,532
Do you like little kids?

254
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:28,667
(chuckles)

255
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:31,036
I've dealt with filthy,
    screaming humans before.

256
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:32,537
At least these are smaller.

257
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:34,673
I'm not sure this is you.

258
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:37,542
BEATRICE:
Ms. Perez says we should
choose jobs we love doing.

259
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:38,910
So, what about you, Maze?

260
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,612
What do you love to do?

261
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:44,382
I don't know.

262
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:45,450
Well...

263
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:46,751
just be yourself.

264
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,788
Thanks, little human.

265
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:54,192
So good.

266
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:56,795
Well, the secret ingredient
     is the Hawaiian bread.

267
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:59,464
And then you just cut a hole
   in the middle for the egg.

268
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:00,932
Can we have this for every meal?

269
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,468
You know, this one used to be
       my favorite, too.

270
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,471
Grandpa used to bring me
  this sandwich every Thursday

271
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:08,573
after acting class.

272
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:10,775
Why don't you ever
      talk about Grandpa?

273
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,844
Mm...

274
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:16,281
...I guess 'cause I miss him.

275
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:20,485
Do you think he would've
     brought me sandwiches?

276
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:23,054
Mm-hmm.

277
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:24,990
I think he would've loved that,
            monkey.

278
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:27,525
(knocking at door)

279
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:28,994
Come on. It's time
       for your homework.

280
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,132
Can I help you?

281
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,333
Chloe Decker?

282
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:38,003
You're gonna pay
     for what you've done.

283
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:47,646
Okay, take it easy.

284
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:50,548
My father was a good man.

285
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,485
He didn't deserve
to get gunned down

286
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,820
like an animal.

287
00:10:55,822 --> 00:11:00,492
All he wanted was
to meet my daughter.

288
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:01,826
You're Tina Fields.

289
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,462
You killed my father.

290
00:11:04,464 --> 00:11:06,131
I didn't...
Thought you were
getting revenge,

291
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:08,433
but you murdered
an innocent man.

292
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:10,135
Tina, think about
                      your baby.

293
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:12,671
If you pull that trigger,
    you'll never hold her again.

294
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:14,773
BEATRICE:
       Mommy? Who's here?

295
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:16,941
It's nothing, honey.
              Stay in your room!

296
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:20,311
I didn't kill
                    your father.

297
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:21,680
You have to believe me.

298
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:24,516
Mommy, is everything okay?

299
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:27,185
Yeah, honey.
      Everything's fine, monkey.

300
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,219
Go back in your room.

301
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:30,088
Mommy just needs
          to help another mommy.

302
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,524
Okay?
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

303
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:34,659
I was just so angry.

304
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:36,661
I never wanted
to believe

305
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:38,496
my dad killed a cop.

306
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:41,499
And then today,
when I got the video...

307
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:42,701
What video?

308
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:45,670
His lawyers sent this to me.

309
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:48,573
Said I was to receive it
upon the event of his death.

310
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:04,055
Ah.

311
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,256
Sorry, not sorry.

312
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:06,591
I had to stop
for a costume change.

313
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:09,427
Nice jacket.
Thank you.

314
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:11,429
Oh, man,
                  what the hell?

315
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:13,431
Are you here to work, or
     are you here to play games?

316
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:15,633
I'll have you know
I take the School of Dan

317
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:17,702
quite seriously,
even if it does involve

318
00:12:17,704 --> 00:12:19,104
skinny-fit jeans.

319
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:20,939
Any news on our suspect?

320
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:22,774
His name is Rodney Lam.

321
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:24,642
A CI told me that he's
obsessed with this place.

322
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:25,643
He eats here
all the time.

323
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:27,212
So if he shows up,

324
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:29,581
let's try to see him
before he sees us.

325
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,049
Oh, I get it now.

326
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:33,418
So your boring attire
                    is like camo

327
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,053
for the average Joe.

328
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:36,821
Blend in, catch
           the baddie off guard.

329
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:38,156
Afterwards they'll forget
              you're even there.

330
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:39,624
That is very clever,
                         Daniel.

331
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:42,160
This guy has a serious
history of violence.

332
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:44,162
All right?
He might have a gun.

333
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:46,498
He might take a hostage.
Who knows what he could do?

334
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,533
So he wouldn't, say,
        be openly eating

335
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:53,071
a nacho burrito dog,
      sitting on that car?

336
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:54,572
You watch my six.

337
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:55,673
Absolutely.

338
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:00,845
Rodney Lam. LAPD.

339
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:02,814
No sudden moves.
You're under arrest.

340
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:03,815
Rodney?

341
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:05,650
Maybe we blend in so well

342
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:07,852
he doesn't even see us.

343
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:09,120
Rodney Lam!

344
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,291
Good call, Rodney.

345
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,826
Nice and easy.

346
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:16,828
Oh.

347
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,997
I just wanted
                  one last meal.

348
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:20,165
You want a bite?
              Aah!

349
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:22,033
No, thank you, we're not
      doing carbs, are we?

350
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:28,406
(clears throat)

351
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:33,244
Baby...

352
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:36,281
it's Daddy.

353
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:40,552
If, uh, you're watching this,

354
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:41,753
that means I'm dead.

355
00:13:41,755 --> 00:13:44,923
Now, I know it sucks.

356
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:46,925
I don't know if you'll
       get this tomorrow

357
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:49,928
or, uh, 30 years from now,

358
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:53,231
but I want you
       to know the truth.

359
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:57,335
I didn't kill that cop.

360
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:01,539
I'm sorry for...

361
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,708
missing all your birthdays
        and graduation--

362
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,710
your life.

363
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:09,247
But Daddy wants you
        to know, baby...

364
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:10,515
I love you.

365
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:14,285
See? He's innocent.

366
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:16,955
Tina, I can tell your dad
            loves you very much,

367
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:19,524
but... this video
         doesn't prove anything.

368
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,659
His lawyers had this tape
for 16 years.

369
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:23,862
He made them promise
to give it to me when he died.

370
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:25,196
That has to mean something.

371
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,032
16 years.

372
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:35,240
He recorded this the day
           my father was killed.

373
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:38,610
(camera beeps)

374
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:43,681
CHLOE:
 Three minutes before he died.

375
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:45,016
What part of town is this?

376
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:47,518
It's our old apartment
in Venice.

377
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,455
My father was killed
 across the city in Koreatown.

378
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:52,624
CHLOE: There's no way your
father could have recorded this

379
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:53,958
and gotten
  to the crime scene in time.

380
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,795
So it's true.
He didn't do it.

381
00:14:57,797 --> 00:14:59,831
Which means whoever did
         kill my father

382
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,633
got away with this
    and is still out there.

383
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:04,302
(breathes deeply, exhales)

384
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:05,603
RODNEY:
           <i> I did it.</i>

385
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:07,972
I killed Joe Fields.

386
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:09,741
He disrespected me in the yard.

387
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:10,842
So when I heard that
he was getting

388
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:12,110
some sort of
temporary leave,

389
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:14,479
I knew that it was my chance
to make things right.

390
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:16,447
Well, there you have it.

391
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:18,116
Looks like our
              douching paid off.

392
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:19,484
The detective will
                     be pleased.

393
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:22,453
And, you know, you
           make it look so easy.

394
00:15:23,857 --> 00:15:26,124
Where did you say you
stopped that van again?

395
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:27,258
Spring and College.

396
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,459
We found it at Hill.

397
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:30,094
That's what I meant.

398
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,330
Then you went and you emptied
the clip into the driver, right?

399
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:33,531
Hell yeah.

400
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:34,999
The driver died from
      a single shot to the neck.

401
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:37,635
Dan One, why are you spoiling
  a perfectly good confession?

402
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:40,638
You're lying, Rodney.

403
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,307
You don't know the facts
because you didn't do it.

404
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:45,209
Oh, I see what
                  you did there.

405
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:48,513
Gosh, that's why
                 you're Dan One.

406
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:51,316
Why are you confessing
to a crime you didn't commit?

407
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:56,688
Where are you going?

408
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:00,191
Well, just slow your
              roll for a second.

409
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:01,292
I think, for the sake
       of the detective,

410
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,293
I'm gonna take a time-out

411
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,428
from my Dansformation.

412
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,596
(inhales, exhales
                   dramatically)

413
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:08,299
(chuckling):
            Oh, God.

414
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:11,469
Rodney, what do you
          want out of life, hmm?

415
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:18,409
To be a good provider
and take care of my family.

416
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:20,411
So you confess to a crime
       you didn't commit.

417
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:22,080
That's quite counterintuitive.

418
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:23,614
Unless you got paid
                       to do it.

419
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:27,085
You've been locked up
for most of your life.

420
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:28,486
That's all you know.

421
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,722
Now you're free,
      you've got mouths to feed,

422
00:16:30,724 --> 00:16:32,023
No way to earn.

423
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:36,394
Out here I'm no one, guys.

424
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:38,629
And if we don't
                     arrest you,

425
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:41,632
you don't get
any money.

426
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:43,935
But if he really wants
            back in the slammer,

427
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:46,537
then false confession's
    a criminal offense, correct?

428
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:48,773
Definitely an
obstruction of justice.
                             Mm.

429
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:50,408
Could get you
a few years.

430
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,609
LUCIFER: We could get you
            a narcoleptic lawyer

431
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:52,677
and a merciless judge.

432
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,612
Who knows? With
             your prior history,

433
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:55,880
they might throw
                the book at you.

434
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:56,881
Hmm?

435
00:16:56,883 --> 00:16:59,617
All right.

436
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:01,252
Here's how it went down.

437
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:04,522
I put word out
that I needed money,

438
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,791
I was desperate.

439
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:09,394
And some people came
to me with an offer.

440
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:12,764
(banging on door)

441
00:17:12,766 --> 00:17:14,966
Linda, you there?

442
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,404
I need a character reference.

443
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:24,976
Linda?

444
00:17:24,978 --> 00:17:26,544
(doorknob rattles)

445
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:31,149
(footfalls departing)

446
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,257
(gasps)

447
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:40,525
Wha...?

448
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,694
Can you teleport?

449
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:46,731
(laughs)
           What? No.

450
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,232
You left your window open.

451
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:53,204
Hey, are you okay?

452
00:17:53,206 --> 00:17:55,773
Wait.

453
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:57,175
You know, don't you?

454
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:00,378
He showed you.

455
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,280
I saw his face.

456
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:06,184
Well, you're taking it
     really well, actually.

457
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:11,656
Linda, you're not
          afraid of<i> me,</i> are you?

458
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:14,859
Of course I am.

459
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:17,061
You're a demon.

460
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:24,235
He told me.

461
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:26,571
I thought it was
       a sexual metaphor.

462
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:28,306
Well, you're not wrong there.

463
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:31,409
But you really are one.

464
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,046
Aren't you?

465
00:18:35,048 --> 00:18:38,883
Yeah... I am.

466
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:43,554
Is that really so bad?

467
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:47,425
Please go.

468
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,331
(door creaks)

469
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:10,948
LUCIFER:
                Ah, Detective...

470
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,884
CHLOE: Joe Fields
     didn't kill my father.

471
00:19:12,886 --> 00:19:14,285
DAN: Wait, what?
                He's a fall guy.

472
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:16,154
He made a false confession
          in exchange

473
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:17,788
for regular payments
        to his daughter.

474
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,390
All these years
  she didn't touch the money.

475
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:21,125
She probably thought
it was stolen.

476
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:22,960
I have the account number
that made the transfers.

477
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:25,563
Well, we just met a chap
         who did the same thing.

478
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:26,631
What?

479
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:28,733
Rodney got paid
to make a false confession.

480
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:30,334
Money was transferred
into his wife's account

481
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,103
right after we
arrested him.

482
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:34,672
This is the same account
    that paid Rodney Lam's wife.

483
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,207
CHLOE:
That's no coincidence.

484
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:38,976
So whoever killed Joe Fields
             killed my father...

485
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:41,312
and is still out there.

486
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:44,782
Hey, don't blame yourself.

487
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:46,150
You were just a kid
back then.

488
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:47,585
Yeah, well, I'm not anymore.

489
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:52,590
(indistinct police
         radio chatter)

490
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:54,592
COP:
                    Hey, rookie!

491
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:55,660
You're late!

492
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:57,361
I thought I was early.

493
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,330
Your FTO's been looking
               all over for you.

494
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:01,065
What, you want to get
      written up your first day?

495
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:02,700
No, I-I honestly thought...

496
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,235
Knock it off, McMillan.

497
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:05,903
Get back to work.

498
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:07,872
You gotta watch out
         for this guy.

499
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:10,341
He gave me hell
     on my first day, too.

500
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:12,443
Hi.
              Hi.

501
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:14,045
I'm Dan Espinoza.

502
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:16,480
Chloe Decker.
               Nice to meet you.

503
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:17,748
Can I help you
                     with those?

504
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,684
Sure.

505
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:22,453
Come on, I'll
                show you around.

506
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:24,322
The most important place, first,

507
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:25,623
is the kitchen.

508
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,592
We got bagels over here
               if you want them.

509
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:29,927
Interrogation's
                     that way...

510
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:31,529
and the lab is thataway.

511
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:36,534
Are you John Decker's
                       daughter?

512
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:41,572
I-I'm so sorry.

513
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,374
He's kind of
           a legend around here.

514
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:44,609
It was a little
                 before my time,

515
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:46,110
but he sounded like
                    a great guy.

516
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:49,447
The best.

517
00:20:50,717 --> 00:20:53,317
Um... bagel?

518
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:04,662
(blowing faux fanfare)

519
00:21:04,664 --> 00:21:06,964
Never fear,
       Luci-Dan is here.

520
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:08,199
Or is it Douche-ifer?

521
00:21:08,201 --> 00:21:09,800
Actually, it's got more
of a ring to it, hasn't it?

522
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:11,869
Why are you two
               dressed the same?

523
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:13,371
Don't ask.

524
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:14,572
The bank account traces back

525
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:15,806
to a bathhouse on Pico.

526
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:18,276
It's a dummy front
for a Russian syndicate in L.A.

527
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:19,944
So the real killer is
       somehow connected

528
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:21,078
to the Russian mob?

529
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,880
We have a suspect.

530
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:24,849
His name is Boris Sokolov.
      Owns the bathhouse.

531
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:27,285
Connects criminals
 but keeps his own hands clean.

532
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:29,086
No one has ever been
      able to get to him.
Yet.

533
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:31,155
Detective Dan and I
won't rest until we get

534
00:21:31,157 --> 00:21:32,857
to the bottom of this,
I promise you.

535
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,130
(sighs)

536
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:42,433
(American accent): Wow. Look who
bought a ticket to the gun show!

537
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:43,801
Divorce becomes you, Detective.

538
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,403
I do not sound like that.

539
00:21:45,405 --> 00:21:46,470
Of course we do.

540
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,539
We sound like two
totally normal dudes.

541
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,007
Will you cut it
      with the "we" stuff?

542
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:52,376
I need you to stop playing
around and take this seriously.

543
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:53,477
You got it, partner.

544
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:54,512
This is gonna be epic.

545
00:21:54,514 --> 00:21:56,180
Lucifer, I'm not kidding.
(sighs)

546
00:21:56,182 --> 00:21:57,982
(regular accent):
Very well.

547
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:00,384
So, what's the plan?

548
00:22:00,386 --> 00:22:01,752
Well, you are exactly
the kind of person

549
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:04,055
that Boris would deal with,
so I need you to approach him,

550
00:22:04,057 --> 00:22:05,556
and try make a deal with him.
All right.

551
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:07,692
Tell him I need a fall guy
for a murder I'm gonna commit?

552
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:08,693
Exactly.
              Hmm.

553
00:22:08,695 --> 00:22:09,860
But like I said before,

554
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:11,462
he spooks really easily.
                 So, don't go...

555
00:22:11,464 --> 00:22:12,663
Boris!

556
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,231
Like that.

557
00:22:16,903 --> 00:22:17,902
Hello there.

558
00:22:17,904 --> 00:22:19,804
Uh, I'd like to talk with you,

559
00:22:19,806 --> 00:22:21,706
if I may.

560
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:23,841
I don't know you.

561
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:24,875
You don't.

562
00:22:24,877 --> 00:22:26,777
So, let's fix that, shall we?

563
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:27,912
The name's Dan.

564
00:22:27,914 --> 00:22:29,280
¶ ¶

565
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:35,052
Deputy Warden's here for you.
                             Oh.

566
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:37,722
Joe Fields' personal effects.

567
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:39,924
We usually turn those over
       to the next of kin

568
00:22:39,926 --> 00:22:42,126
within 72 hours, but, uh...

569
00:22:42,128 --> 00:22:43,594
I thought it might help you,
           Detective.

570
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:45,663
Thank you.

571
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:50,801
This is great.
                      Thank you.

572
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:53,037
Well, if there's anything else
       I can do to help,

573
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,271
please, let me know.

574
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:56,307
(quietly):
            Thanks.

575
00:23:04,317 --> 00:23:05,516
I know.

576
00:23:05,518 --> 00:23:07,585
Joe Fields isn't my case.

577
00:23:07,587 --> 00:23:09,854
I'll just...
     I'll leave it for Dan.

578
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:10,888
Well, I mean,

579
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,990
nothing is stopping<i> me</i> from

580
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:15,292
helping out
with the Joe Fields case,

581
00:23:15,294 --> 00:23:17,895
While you tackle
       your dad's, right?

582
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:20,197
I mean, if it's
       the same killer...

583
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:21,298
divide and conquer.

584
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,833
You don't have to do that.

585
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:24,335
I kind of already started.

586
00:23:24,337 --> 00:23:26,971
Uh, right over here. Thanks.

587
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:31,742
Last six months
    of your dad's paperwork.

588
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:35,045
You know, incident reports,
booking slips, arrest records.

589
00:23:35,047 --> 00:23:37,248
I mean, half of it's on
 microfiche and, like, papyrus,

590
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,583
but I don't know, I thought it
would help, you know,

591
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:42,586
to figure out what your dad was
working on when he was killed.

592
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:44,255
See?

593
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:45,923
I knew you were a hugger.

594
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:50,327
So. What do you got so far?

595
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:51,762
It was a clever cover-up.

596
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:55,332
But what kind of robber
     would be so well connected?

597
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:56,567
You know?

598
00:23:56,569 --> 00:23:59,003
They gave Joe Fields
            everything he needed

599
00:23:59,005 --> 00:24:00,438
to pose as my father's killer.

600
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,739
I mean, he confessed.

601
00:24:01,741 --> 00:24:04,241
And he had the gun
 that was used in the shooting.

602
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:06,243
Ballistics confirmed
that it was the murder weapon.

603
00:24:06,245 --> 00:24:09,013
Well, yeah.
 No wonder it was case closed.

604
00:24:09,015 --> 00:24:11,582
Yeah. I-I... These
            prints are un-I.D.'d

605
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:12,683
from the scene,

606
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:14,118
but they could be the killer's.

607
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,853
And did they ping anyone
        in the database?

608
00:24:15,855 --> 00:24:17,021
No. Dead end.

609
00:24:17,023 --> 00:24:18,889
All right.

610
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:20,458
Maybe I can dig a little deeper.

611
00:24:24,564 --> 00:24:26,363
So, tell me.

612
00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:28,999
Why would I help you two?

613
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:30,801
Because we're just
             two regular fellows

614
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:32,203
who need your help, Boris.

615
00:24:32,205 --> 00:24:33,838
I don't believe you.

616
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,306
Mr. Sokolov...

617
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:37,975
People call me
human lie detector

618
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:40,277
because I look
in my clients' eyes,

619
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:42,279
and I can know
 if they're telling the truth.

620
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:44,181
Well, I respect that, Boris.

621
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:46,550
I have a trick myself,
that's quite similar, actually.

622
00:24:46,552 --> 00:24:48,452
And you're right.

623
00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:50,020
We haven't told you
                the whole truth.

624
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:52,590
So, here goes.

625
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:55,860
I want someone dead.

626
00:24:55,862 --> 00:24:57,361
Who?

627
00:24:57,363 --> 00:24:59,296
Lucifer Morningstar.

628
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,134
And what has this person
     done to deserve death?

629
00:25:04,136 --> 00:25:05,769
Well, he hurts people.

630
00:25:05,771 --> 00:25:08,772
And not just his enemies,

631
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:10,975
those close to him, as well.

632
00:25:12,812 --> 00:25:14,512
In fact, I think he hurts
       them most of all.

633
00:25:16,816 --> 00:25:18,048
He's right.

634
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:21,118
The guy's violent,
he's a total loose cannon.

635
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,255
Yes. Believe me,
              when I say, Boris,

636
00:25:24,257 --> 00:25:26,824
that the world would be
  a better place without him.

637
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,728
You both have true hatred
         for this man.

638
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:32,796
Apparently so.

639
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:35,766
Do we have a deal?

640
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:38,936
(sniffs)

641
00:25:38,938 --> 00:25:40,004
(grunts)

642
00:25:43,242 --> 00:25:46,110
Go and take care
    of this Lucifer person.

643
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:48,913
I'll find you your patsy.

644
00:25:51,183 --> 00:25:52,616
Lovely.

645
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:07,264
I hear you won't talk.

646
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:11,769
Okay.

647
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:14,471
We have hard evidence
       linking your bank account

648
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:15,906
to two different murders.

649
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:17,474
What do you have
              to say about that?

650
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:21,211
I heard you're a
             human lie detector,

651
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:22,479
is that true?

652
00:26:24,183 --> 00:26:26,617
(clears throat)

653
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:29,086
One of those murders
                  was my father.

654
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,788
It's why I'm not on the case

655
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:33,424
and it's why I'm not supposed to
 be in this room talking to you.

656
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:36,093
But I'm not a cop right now,
             Boris.

657
00:26:37,863 --> 00:26:40,030
I'm a daughter.

658
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:42,766
(inhales)
 And I'm not gonna let this go.

659
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:45,936
So, you point me in
          the right direction...

660
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:49,073
or I swear to God, I'm gonna
 make your life a living hell.

661
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:52,443
I believe you.

662
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:54,678
His name was John Decker.

663
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:00,384
I admit to nothing

664
00:27:00,386 --> 00:27:02,886
but I did once hear

665
00:27:02,888 --> 00:27:04,488
about a John Decker.

666
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:07,458
And as I recall,

667
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,527
he was sniffing somewhere
       he didn't belong.

668
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:12,730
What do you mean?
    My father was a beat cop

669
00:27:12,732 --> 00:27:14,231
at a robbery gone wrong.

670
00:27:28,581 --> 00:27:29,947
Hey, man.

671
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:33,183
I just want to say
       nice work earlier.

672
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:34,985
Was it?
                           Yeah.

673
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,387
We got Boris.

674
00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:39,390
And I don't know how
   you lied to him like that.

675
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,758
Well, it's simple.
         I didn't lie.

676
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,159
Well...
            (sighs)

677
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:44,361
Well, then you have
   some serious issues, bro.

678
00:27:44,363 --> 00:27:45,362
Obviously. I mean,

679
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:47,197
why do you think I'm doing
all this Dan-ing?

680
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:48,499
(chuckles)
Yet,

681
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:49,800
you know, I'm still no closer

682
00:27:49,802 --> 00:27:51,502
to figuring out your secret.

683
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:52,736
Because I don't have a secret.

684
00:27:52,738 --> 00:27:53,971
Well, you must.

685
00:27:53,973 --> 00:27:56,340
One that explains how
    you're able to be so...

686
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:58,042
you know, frustratingly you.

687
00:27:58,044 --> 00:27:59,109
You see, man...
Hmm?

688
00:27:59,111 --> 00:28:00,744
I try to compliment
                     you, and...

689
00:28:00,746 --> 00:28:02,112
(quietly):
              Hey.

690
00:28:02,114 --> 00:28:04,448
I think my father's death
           was a hit.

691
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:07,017
I-It sounds like he stumbled
      onto something huge,

692
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:09,019
and-and someone
      took him out for it.

693
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,387
Chloe, do you want me
     to help you with this?

694
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:12,990
No. I-I... I got it
  on this end. But thank you.

695
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,126
Well.
(chuckles)

696
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:18,128
Where to now, Twinsy? Hmm?

697
00:28:21,634 --> 00:28:23,100
¶ ¶

698
00:28:30,643 --> 00:28:31,775
Wow.
                         (sighs)

699
00:28:31,777 --> 00:28:33,143
What's the job this time?

700
00:28:33,145 --> 00:28:34,344
Topless maids.

701
00:28:34,346 --> 00:28:36,613
But apparently, I still
       have to do some cleaning.

702
00:28:36,615 --> 00:28:37,614
(scoffs)

703
00:28:37,616 --> 00:28:40,050
Screw that.

704
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:41,852
You okay?
                   No. I just...

705
00:28:42,822 --> 00:28:46,156
I can't find the right job.

706
00:28:46,158 --> 00:28:49,326
My only friend
     stopped talking to me.

707
00:28:49,328 --> 00:28:50,694
"Only"?

708
00:28:50,696 --> 00:28:52,596
(soft laughter)

709
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:55,999
What's all of this?

710
00:28:56,001 --> 00:28:57,901
My dad's stuff from storage.
         After he died,

711
00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:00,604
the department boxed up his desk
       and sent it to us.

712
00:29:00,606 --> 00:29:01,739
You find anything?

713
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:03,240
Not yet.

714
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:06,477
One of the cases he assisted on
got him killed, and I have to

715
00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:08,212
figure out which one
         it is, but...

716
00:29:08,214 --> 00:29:10,481
It's funny, he always talked
about how he didn't

717
00:29:10,483 --> 00:29:11,849
want to be a detective,

718
00:29:11,851 --> 00:29:15,219
how it was too much work,
     and yet... here he was

719
00:29:15,221 --> 00:29:17,154
doing all this detective work.

720
00:29:17,156 --> 00:29:18,956
Guess the apple doesn't
         fall far from the tree.

721
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:21,792
Hmm.

722
00:29:21,794 --> 00:29:23,761
I tried a bunch of stuff, but...

723
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:26,363
after my dad died,
     this just felt right.

724
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:27,498
Yeah, but like...

725
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:31,835
how do you know
               what<i> feels</i> right?

726
00:29:31,837 --> 00:29:33,971
Mm...

727
00:29:33,973 --> 00:29:35,239
You just know.

728
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:39,076
¶ ¶

729
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:44,615
¶ You missed by a whisker ¶

730
00:29:44,617 --> 00:29:46,416
¶ You won't find me ¶

731
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:50,621
¶ Slippin' through
         your fingers ¶

732
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:54,291
¶ So easily ¶

733
00:29:55,761 --> 00:29:58,695
¶ 'Cause I'm the one
       you can't forget ¶

734
00:29:58,697 --> 00:30:01,899
¶ The one that's stuck
       inside your head ¶

735
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:04,067
No secret, indeed.

736
00:30:04,069 --> 00:30:06,770
So, what's behind
    door number one, Daniel?

737
00:30:06,772 --> 00:30:08,405
¶ Catch me if you can. ¶

738
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:10,474
(Dan imitating engine revving)

739
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:15,479
(revving continues)

740
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:17,347
LUCIFER:
     Oh, no, no. Not this.

741
00:30:19,018 --> 00:30:20,884
(imitates brake sound)

742
00:30:20,886 --> 00:30:22,553
Better a snuff movie,

743
00:30:22,555 --> 00:30:24,087
a human centipede,

744
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:26,890
clown porn, but not improv!

745
00:30:26,892 --> 00:30:28,892
Hey, thanks
for picking me up, man.

746
00:30:28,894 --> 00:30:30,227
What's your name?

747
00:30:30,229 --> 00:30:31,995
(English accent):
    Lucifer... Morningstar.

748
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:34,998
MAN: Wait, I'm hitchhiking
                 with the Devil?

749
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,733
(audience laughter)
                 Oh, yes indeed.

750
00:30:36,735 --> 00:30:39,469
MAN: I didn't expect the Devil
   to be driving around L.A.

751
00:30:39,471 --> 00:30:41,505
Oh, yes, I live here,
                       actually.

752
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:43,841
I do whatever I want.

753
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:45,209
Oh, like what?

754
00:30:45,211 --> 00:30:47,678
Drink, mostly.
              And insult people.

755
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,846
You ponce.

756
00:30:48,848 --> 00:30:50,814
(laughter)

757
00:30:50,816 --> 00:30:52,049
DAN:
     You got a girlfriend?

758
00:30:52,051 --> 00:30:53,750
Yes.
                         Lovely.

759
00:30:53,752 --> 00:30:55,519
Can I borrow her?
              But she's the love

760
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:57,421
of my life.
                        Perfect.

761
00:30:57,423 --> 00:30:58,488
(audience whoops)

762
00:30:58,490 --> 00:30:59,890
Let's make it a threesome.
           (laughter)

763
00:30:59,892 --> 00:31:01,425
That is not me!

764
00:31:01,427 --> 00:31:03,193
MAN 2:
  Relax, you'll get your turn.

765
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:05,395
MAN 3:
   What's your problem, huh?

766
00:31:05,397 --> 00:31:07,698
MAN 2:
    You gotta sign up, pal.

767
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,234
MAN:
Good scene, man. You crushed it.

768
00:31:10,236 --> 00:31:11,535
DAN:
         You too, pal.

769
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:12,870
Detective Douche!

770
00:31:12,872 --> 00:31:15,706
How dare you
subject me to this

771
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:17,241
pathetic caricature?

772
00:31:17,243 --> 00:31:18,308
You have the nerve
         to stand there

773
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,810
and accuse me
     of making fun of you,

774
00:31:19,812 --> 00:31:21,545
after everything you've done
    in the last couple days.

775
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:22,880
Hell, ever since we first met.

776
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:24,448
Detective Douche, I...
                            Dan!

777
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:26,316
My name is Dan.

778
00:31:27,786 --> 00:31:29,519
Or Detective Espinoza.

779
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:30,787
Right.

780
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:32,623
Dan.

781
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:34,291
I only did it

782
00:31:34,293 --> 00:31:36,460
because you're everything
         that I'm not.

783
00:31:36,462 --> 00:31:37,861
Boring,

784
00:31:37,863 --> 00:31:39,363
helpful.

785
00:31:39,365 --> 00:31:40,530
Your life is simple.

786
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:43,634
(scoffs) Oh. My life?
              Yes.

787
00:31:43,636 --> 00:31:45,602
Come on, man. You're rich.
        You're handsome.

788
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:47,638
You drive fancy cars,
      you date hot girls.

789
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,073
You have no kids,
 you have no responsibilities.

790
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:52,042
How much more simple
         can life get?

791
00:31:52,044 --> 00:31:53,443
Afraid you don't know
        the whole story.

792
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:55,479
Well, fine. Tell me.

793
00:31:56,448 --> 00:31:58,415
(chuckles softly)

794
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:02,185
You see, that's just it, Dan.

795
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:05,555
The last person
    I opened up to, I hurt.

796
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:08,425
A lot.

797
00:32:09,862 --> 00:32:12,896
Let alone how I've hurt
    my own flesh and blood.

798
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:14,665
¶ ¶

799
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:16,667
(exhales, scoffs)

800
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:18,969
(sighs)

801
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:21,939
It's all I seem
               to be able to do.

802
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:28,812
Welcome to the club.

803
00:32:30,482 --> 00:32:33,717
You think Chloe divorced me
      because I'm a perfect guy?

804
00:32:36,522 --> 00:32:41,158
I did a lot of things that
       I'm not... proud of, man.

805
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,427
And I'm just trying
           to work through them.

806
00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:44,995
What, through mime?

807
00:32:44,997 --> 00:32:46,596
What do you do,
stuff your feelings in a box

808
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:47,864
and throw away the key?

809
00:32:47,866 --> 00:32:49,766
It's not mime.

810
00:32:49,768 --> 00:32:51,735
It's improv.

811
00:32:51,737 --> 00:32:53,904
And I started the
         class after the divorce

812
00:32:53,906 --> 00:32:55,872
because I needed
                  a distraction.

813
00:32:57,843 --> 00:33:01,678
Perspective.

814
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,780
A way to step out of
          my own skin for a bit.

815
00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:06,750
I don't know, I...

816
00:33:06,752 --> 00:33:09,786
I'm not a spontaneous guy.

817
00:33:09,788 --> 00:33:12,622
I don't live in the
             moment like you do.

818
00:33:12,624 --> 00:33:17,561
So, you were trying to learn
how not to Douche.

819
00:33:17,563 --> 00:33:19,096
(chuckles)

820
00:33:19,098 --> 00:33:21,031
Yeah, I guess that's
              one way to put it.

821
00:33:21,033 --> 00:33:24,534
(both laughing)

822
00:33:26,939 --> 00:33:29,840
Don't tell Chloe.

823
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:31,842
All right?

824
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:33,110
(chuckles)

825
00:33:34,613 --> 00:33:36,546
Oh.

826
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:37,814
<i> (knocks on door)</i>

827
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:39,883
Oh, it's you.

828
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:41,251
Hello, Detective.

829
00:33:41,253 --> 00:33:42,452
I got your message.
         (door closes)

830
00:33:42,454 --> 00:33:43,987
Oh, hi.

831
00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:46,156
Feeling back to your old self?

832
00:33:46,158 --> 00:33:47,224
I suppose.

833
00:33:47,226 --> 00:33:48,759
So I doubt I'll be of much help.

834
00:33:48,761 --> 00:33:49,960
Ooh.

835
00:33:49,962 --> 00:33:51,461
On second thoughts,
it looks like

836
00:33:51,463 --> 00:33:52,929
I came at just the right time.

837
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:55,198
I've have nothing
                  to say to you.

838
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,733
Thanks to you, I lost my friend.

839
00:33:56,735 --> 00:33:58,268
Friend? What friend?

840
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,369
The doctor.

841
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:00,837
I was just working
      through some stuff.

842
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:03,974
I didn't think that showing...
        See, that's the problem.

843
00:34:03,976 --> 00:34:07,978
I wish for just one second
     you would<i> think</i> about

844
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,413
someone other than yourself.

845
00:34:09,415 --> 00:34:11,381
And there
we have it, ladies.

846
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:12,816
My wake of destruction.

847
00:34:12,818 --> 00:34:14,584
Anyone else
     you need harmed, hmm?

848
00:34:14,586 --> 00:34:15,919
Okay, Lucifer?

849
00:34:15,921 --> 00:34:16,987
Enough.

850
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:18,188
I'm close to something,

851
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,289
I can feel it.

852
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:20,390
Help.

853
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:22,492
Fine.

854
00:34:25,064 --> 00:34:27,197
Actually, there is something

855
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,498
that's been
          bugging me, Detective.

856
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,866
Do you mind if I
          play the me's advocate

857
00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:32,702
for just a second?
  Go ahead.

858
00:34:32,704 --> 00:34:34,871
Well, there's one part of this
   puzzle that just doesn't fit.

859
00:34:34,873 --> 00:34:36,139
Joe Fields.

860
00:34:36,141 --> 00:34:37,307
Wha... why doesn't he fit?

861
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:38,542
Well, you said
     that he smiled at you

862
00:34:38,544 --> 00:34:39,576
when he was released.

863
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:41,478
Yeah, I forgot about that.

864
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,214
So, why would an
              innocent man smile

865
00:34:44,216 --> 00:34:46,416
at the daughter of a man
   he took the fall for killing?

866
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,920
He wouldn't.

867
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:52,055
What are you looking for?

868
00:34:52,057 --> 00:34:54,524
The prints that Ella found
   on Fields' transport van.

869
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:56,126
But those only
             gave us Rodney Lam.

870
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,494
But there were other prints.

871
00:34:57,496 --> 00:34:59,696
But they cleared
as prison personnel.

872
00:34:59,698 --> 00:35:01,598
Like Deputy Warden Perry Smith.

873
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,899
These are his prints.

874
00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:04,067
What, you think
       the warden did it?

875
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:05,702
Well, deputy wardens

876
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:07,337
are desk jockeys, bureaucrats.

877
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:08,905
So his prints shouldn't
                have been there.

878
00:35:08,907 --> 00:35:11,374
Yes. What if Fields
wasn't smiling at me?

879
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:13,443
<i> What if he was smiling</i>
   <i> at the person next to me?</i>

880
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,045
<i> The warden?</i>

881
00:35:15,047 --> 00:35:16,813
So you think that
       Joe Fields and the warden

882
00:35:16,815 --> 00:35:18,715
had some kind of deal?
Yes.

883
00:35:18,717 --> 00:35:21,118
What, Fields serves
          16 years as a fall guy

884
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,252
and then suddenly has
       a change of heart?

885
00:35:22,254 --> 00:35:23,286
Well, he had a grandkid.

886
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:25,088
Maybe he got sick of the deal,

887
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,523
told the warden he wanted out?

888
00:35:26,525 --> 00:35:27,858
And the warden said yes,

889
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,593
but only as a ploy
        to kill Fields.

890
00:35:29,595 --> 00:35:30,961
Right.

891
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:32,496
(typing on keyboard)

892
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,766
Deputy Warden Perry Smith

893
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:39,302
worked in the prison system
         for 20 years.

894
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:40,804
Started as a guard.

895
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:42,205
He's our guy.

896
00:35:42,207 --> 00:35:43,807
Let's go.

897
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:45,775
Right, well, wouldn't Dan
be more helpful?

898
00:35:45,777 --> 00:35:48,445
What?

899
00:35:48,447 --> 00:35:51,214
If I'm gonna take this guy down,

900
00:35:51,216 --> 00:35:53,650
I need my partner

901
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:54,718
and that's you.

902
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,453
Lucifer Morningstar.

903
00:35:56,455 --> 00:35:57,654
(soft chuckle)

904
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:58,989
Right.

905
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,260
Good-bye!

906
00:36:03,262 --> 00:36:05,395
I guess I'll just clean up.

907
00:36:06,365 --> 00:36:08,732
I'm dressed for it, apparently.

908
00:36:08,734 --> 00:36:10,734
(siren wailing)

909
00:36:12,971 --> 00:36:14,771
(indistinct radio chatter)

910
00:36:15,908 --> 00:36:17,474
It looks like
the cavalry's arrived.

911
00:36:17,476 --> 00:36:18,508
Dan, what's happening?

912
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,043
I'm so sorry, Chloe.

913
00:36:20,045 --> 00:36:21,411
The warden gave us the slip.

914
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:22,512
What?

915
00:36:30,122 --> 00:36:31,388
LUCIFER:
    <i> Are you okay, Detective?</i>

916
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:34,191
This whole time, my father's
killer's been out there.

917
00:36:34,193 --> 00:36:36,259
And today I let him get away.

918
00:36:36,261 --> 00:36:38,128
So, no, I feel like a failure.

919
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:41,198
What-- you are
            nothing of the sort.

920
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,766
Detective,

921
00:36:42,768 --> 00:36:45,135
for the first time
                    in 16 years,

922
00:36:45,137 --> 00:36:47,704
you know who the real killer is.

923
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:50,640
It seems to me that
      justice is in your sights.

924
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:52,776
You're right.

925
00:36:52,778 --> 00:36:54,077
I put out a BOLO.

926
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,479
FBI and DHS are
looking at airports,

927
00:36:56,481 --> 00:36:59,316
border crossings.
             Well, I've still no
           idea what that means,

928
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:00,450
but it sounds good.

929
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:02,285
It means I'm gonna get
the son of a bitch.

930
00:37:02,287 --> 00:37:04,454
Right. Well...

931
00:37:04,456 --> 00:37:07,891
in the meantime, since
    your offspring's with Dan...

932
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:09,826
What?
           I'm simply suggesting

933
00:37:09,828 --> 00:37:11,928
that you open a bottle
              of wine, or three,

934
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:15,398
for yourself, and
             just have a nice...
       (muffled grunting)

935
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:26,409
(man groans loudly)
Shut up!

936
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:27,410
(coughing)

937
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:29,379
LUCIFER (laughing):
Well...

938
00:37:29,381 --> 00:37:31,915
Bravo, Maze.

939
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:35,852
How did you get...

940
00:37:35,854 --> 00:37:37,254
I was bored.

941
00:37:37,256 --> 00:37:38,922
Had nothing to do.

942
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:43,393
So, I tracked down
             the scumbag myself.

943
00:37:43,395 --> 00:37:45,862
It just... felt right.

944
00:37:51,236 --> 00:37:53,336
It's gonna feel good
to call this in.

945
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:55,005
LUCIFER:
What? No, hold on, Detective.

946
00:37:55,007 --> 00:37:56,072
You have a choice
to make here.

947
00:37:56,074 --> 00:37:57,507
Yes.

948
00:37:57,509 --> 00:37:59,276
So much punishment.

949
00:37:59,278 --> 00:38:01,211
Mm.
Order off-menu for once.

950
00:38:01,213 --> 00:38:02,646
Maze and I certainly
won't judge.

951
00:38:08,654 --> 00:38:12,188
You took my father away.

952
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:15,792
(crying):
   You tore apart my family.

953
00:38:17,396 --> 00:38:19,996
(tape rips, groans)

954
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:21,798
(chuckles)

955
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,433
I tried to get
                 him to drop it.

956
00:38:23,435 --> 00:38:25,035
But he wouldn't take the hint.

957
00:38:25,037 --> 00:38:28,171
That's all you have to say?

958
00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:30,106
After everything you've done?

959
00:38:30,108 --> 00:38:32,942
No, no, no. No, no, no.
                    I-I'm sorry.

960
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:34,544
I'll give you all the players
        in my operation.

961
00:38:34,546 --> 00:38:35,812
I'll give you money.

962
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:41,384
(shuddered breathing)

963
00:38:46,058 --> 00:38:50,026
Oh.

964
00:38:50,028 --> 00:38:53,363
We'll see how you do
  in the prison that you ran.

965
00:38:56,134 --> 00:38:58,902
I'll bet your inmates
   will treat you real nice.

966
00:38:58,904 --> 00:39:02,839
No. No, please, please.

967
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,874
I can get you
       whatever you want.

968
00:39:04,876 --> 00:39:09,279
All I want is for you to know
that John Decker's kid got you.

969
00:39:17,723 --> 00:39:20,757
(knocks on door)

970
00:39:20,759 --> 00:39:23,393
MAZE (through door):
             Linda.

971
00:39:23,395 --> 00:39:27,063
I know you're in there.

972
00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:29,032
I have something to show you.

973
00:39:33,338 --> 00:39:35,872
My first check.

974
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:37,674
I got paid.

975
00:39:37,676 --> 00:39:39,376
As a bounty hunter!

976
00:39:39,378 --> 00:39:41,978
LAPD paid me this finder's fee

977
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,714
to track down
      some human scumbag.

978
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:47,550
Hunting humans is a job.

979
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:49,319
Who knew?

980
00:39:55,127 --> 00:40:00,096
First thing I wanted to do
was to celebrate with my friend.

981
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:01,898
That's you, Linda.

982
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:30,293
Okay.

983
00:40:30,295 --> 00:40:32,562
I just...

984
00:40:32,564 --> 00:40:34,931
wanted you to know.

985
00:40:43,442 --> 00:40:45,608
(door unlocks)

986
00:40:49,047 --> 00:40:52,348
Maze, how can we be friends?

987
00:40:54,286 --> 00:40:56,152
You're a...

988
00:40:56,154 --> 00:40:58,288
you're a demon.

989
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:02,459
Lucifer's the Devil.

990
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:04,794
How am I supposed
               to get over that?

991
00:41:06,765 --> 00:41:09,265
He's still the same old Lucifer.

992
00:41:09,267 --> 00:41:12,068
You're still
Dr. Linda Martin.

993
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,970
And I'm still Maze.

994
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,638
What's changed?

995
00:41:18,343 --> 00:41:20,477
Come on.

996
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:25,248
Let Mazikeen Smith
        buy you a drink.

997
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,317
(chuckles)

998
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:31,321
Maybe I'll devour your soul
         or something.

999
00:41:38,096 --> 00:41:40,029
¶ Quiet as that secret ¶

1000
00:41:40,031 --> 00:41:42,365
¶ You keep ¶

1001
00:41:42,367 --> 00:41:45,235
¶ Still in your heart
         as you sleep ¶

1002
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:48,171
Here you go, monkey.
              Mmm.

1003
00:41:48,173 --> 00:41:49,439
Yummy.
Lucif...

1004
00:41:49,441 --> 00:41:51,674
Mmm. Why should
      the child go first?

1005
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:52,942
I'm far larger.

1006
00:41:52,944 --> 00:41:53,943
And hungrier.

1007
00:41:53,945 --> 00:41:55,044
It's okay, Mommy.

1008
00:41:55,046 --> 00:41:57,046
He must've really wanted it.

1009
00:41:57,048 --> 00:41:58,081
(Lucifer scoffs, Chloe giggles)

1010
00:41:58,083 --> 00:41:59,349
Is she always so...

1011
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:00,984
her?

1012
00:42:00,986 --> 00:42:02,151
Baby, it's time to get dressed.

1013
00:42:03,488 --> 00:42:04,487
(yells)

1014
00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:06,055
What are you doing?

1015
00:42:06,057 --> 00:42:06,956
(scoffs)

1016
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:08,992
Bye, Lucifer!
   Yes.

1017
00:42:14,499 --> 00:42:16,566
(exhales):
              Yes.

1018
00:42:19,504 --> 00:42:21,304
I don't care much for my dad.

1019
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:26,809
But... you clearly...
               care about yours.

1020
00:42:26,811 --> 00:42:29,612
Which is why you followed
    in his footsteps, I suppose.

1021
00:42:29,614 --> 00:42:30,914
Hmm.

1022
00:42:30,916 --> 00:42:32,048
(sighs)

1023
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:37,020
So, w-what I'm
             trying to say is...

1024
00:42:37,022 --> 00:42:38,621
I think he would
                be proud of you.

1025
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:42,292
Oh. My apologies, Detective.

1026
00:42:42,294 --> 00:42:43,459
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1027
00:42:43,461 --> 00:42:46,062
No, no, it's...

1028
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:49,966
Wh... Then why are
                  you... crying?

1029
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:52,936
(sighs)

1030
00:42:54,272 --> 00:42:55,838
Just... Oh, just shut up.

1031
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,839
What...

1032
00:42:56,841 --> 00:42:59,475
¶ High as the heavenly sea ¶

1033
00:42:59,477 --> 00:43:03,680
¶ Low lays the devil in me. ¶
