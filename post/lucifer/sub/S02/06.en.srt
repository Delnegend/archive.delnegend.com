00:00:05,106 --> 00:00:06,205
I think it's gonna be fine.

4
00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:08,140
With a short adjustment period.

5
00:00:08,142 --> 00:00:11,310
You made a deal to return
Mom to hell, in exchange,

6
00:00:11,312 --> 00:00:13,445
Chloe's life was spared.

You have 24 hours,

with your detective.

12
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:25,457
Uriel is here?
               He's after Chloe,

13
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:27,659

Your single life is dead.

33

But your life of wedded bliss

34
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:23,515
is just beginning.

00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:26,285

Lucifer?

66
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:41,927
Doctor!

67
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:42,928
(whoops)

68
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,263
Come to join the party?

69
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:45,664
No, I'm here to check on you.

70
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,799
You didn't show for our session.
                     Yeah, yeah.

71
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:49,501
I know, I canceled that.

72
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,236
Yeah, which is odd,
because you never cancel.

73
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:52,704
Is everything okay?

74
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:53,906
Mm!

75
00:02:53,908 --> 00:02:56,375
It's fine, just a little
       family drama, that's all.

76
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:57,509
Nothing to worry about.

77
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,244
Family drama?
                        Mm.

78
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:00,312
My brother died.

79
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:01,313
Amenadiel?

80
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:02,314
Mm!

            No, no.

82
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:05,651
No, I-- another brother.

83
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:06,718
I have many.

84
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,587
Lucifer, I'm so sorry.

85
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:10,789
Oh, it's fine,
    what's done is done, eh?

86
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:11,790
Whiskey?

87
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:14,393
No, no, you...
       Lucifer, patients

88
00:03:14,395 --> 00:03:15,594
often avoid sessions

89
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:17,462
precisely when they
               need it the most.

90
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:19,932
When the feelings
are too painful.

91
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:21,934
Are you sure you don't
need to talk?

92
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:23,635
Well, I think there's a few
     other things I'd rather do,

93
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:24,770
you know.
No, no.

94
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:26,405
Okay, Lucifer, no, no, no.
                    (chuckling):
                        Come on.

95
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:29,174
Huh?
No, we're not doing that
anymore, and you know that.

96
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:30,626
(scoffs)
Now, I'm here

97
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,077
if you want to talk
  about your brother's death,

98
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,946
but in a...

99
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:35,681
in an appropriate manner.

100
00:03:35,683 --> 00:03:36,815
Oh, what's the point?

101
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:37,816
You wouldn't
          understand me, anyway.

102
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:39,551
You think everything
            I say is a metaphor.

103
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,286
Now if you don't mind,

104
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:42,421
you're killing my buzz.

105
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:43,422
Ladies.

106
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:44,690
LINDA:
Well, if you change your mind,

107
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:46,291
my door is always open.

108
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:47,326
(women chuckling)

109
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,494
Well, feel free to shut it.

00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:16,321
Look, Mommy, I'm swinging!

113
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:20,192
Hey, baby, get off of that.

114
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:22,928
Hey.

115
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,529
Can you let Maze and Mommy
talk for a minute?

116
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:25,597
Please?
            Mm-hmm.

117
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:26,999
Okay.

118
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:28,600
Seriously?

119
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:29,601
A sex swing?

120
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,236
I know, right?

121
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:32,738
You want to hop on?

122
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,473
Okay, if we're gonna
live together,

123
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:35,974
we need to have
some house rules.

124
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:38,076
Rule number one, and I can't
believe I'm saying this,

125
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:39,177
no sex swing.

126
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:42,481
You said I could
             bring my furniture.

127
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:44,149
A sex swing is not furniture.

128
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:46,885
We have to agree on what's gonna
be in the common area, Maze.

129
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:48,920
Fine, I don't agree with
        your cheesy decorations.

130
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:50,656
You don't like Halloween?

131
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:51,923
Of course I do.

132
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:54,593
Slutty outfits, humans
   abandoning their inhibitions,

133
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:56,762
masquerade orgies.

134
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:57,763
That's great.

135
00:04:57,765 --> 00:04:59,531
But that's not our Halloween.

136
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:00,899
You live with a child now.

137
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:03,035
You're gonna have to rethink
how you look at things.

138
00:05:03,037 --> 00:05:05,237
Oh.

139
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:06,738
Do I?

140
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,577
Maybe living together
was a bad idea.

141
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:15,347
Now that's something
                we can agree on.
         (phone rings)

142
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:18,650

144
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:23,255
DAN:
      This is Peggy Russo.

145
00:05:23,257 --> 00:05:25,657
She's a movie makeup artist
       from Studio City.

146
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,392
Died from a single
              shot to the chest.

147
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:28,994
Still waiting on ballistics,
               but it looks like

148
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:31,563
it's a large caliber bullet,
       most likely from a rifle.

149
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:33,665
Anyone see the shooter?
 Ah, we're still combing through

150
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,667
the guest list, but so far, no.

151
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,102
Everyone was focused
                on the ceremony.

152
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:39,438
What about the wait staff?
 Questioned them first, nothing.

153
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,107
But we're running everyone's
info, see if we have any priors.

154
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:43,809
Great.

155
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:45,377
Dead center shot.

156
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:47,112
You said, the-- what?
   The groom was hit in the arm?

157
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:48,680
Yeah.
So he botches the first shot,

158
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,315
and aces the second?

159
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:52,034
Maybe the bride

160
00:05:52,035 --> 00:05:53,752
was the intended target, and
 the groom just got in the way.

161
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:55,921
Where is he now?

162
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:57,689
Uh, he's over with the medics.

163
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,826
(tires screech)

164
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:03,562
I can't believe she's gone.

165
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:04,563
Why would anybody

166
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:05,964
want to do this?

167
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:08,367
CHLOE: Did Peggy have
           problems with anyone?

168
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:10,769
Anyone you know of that
    would've wanted to hurt her?

169
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:11,970
(Lucifer burps)

170
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:14,239
(crying):
              No.

171
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:15,707
Peggy's amazing.

172
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,342
She's beautiful

173
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:19,077
and smart

174
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:21,013
and funny.

175
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:22,948
Sorry. I'm sorry I have
to ask you these questions.

176
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,984
Oh! Devil's food cake.

177
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:28,887
I've definitely come
      to the right place.

178
00:06:30,124 --> 00:06:31,757
There we go.

179
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:32,824
CHLOE:
                    Oh, Lucifer.

180
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:33,992
So good of you to show.

181
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:35,127
You realize you're late, yeah?

182
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:37,729
Oh, and you're eating
              possible evidence.

183
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,731
What?
                 Give me that.

184
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:40,732
(mouth full):
Surely all this food

185
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,501
can't go to waste, Detective.

186
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:44,503
You look like hell.
(snickers)

187
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:45,570
(imitates rimshot)

188
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:46,805
Not heard that before.

189
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:48,240
Are you drunk?
I wish.

190
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:51,810
Pesky supernatural metabolism
keeps getting in the way.

191
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:54,246
Still doesn't stop me
trying, though.

192
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:55,647
No!

193
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:57,616
No drinking at a crime scene.

194
00:06:57,618 --> 00:06:58,750
Fine.

195
00:06:58,752 --> 00:06:59,885
What murder
are we solving today?

196
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:01,953
I mean, everyone here
looks dead.

197
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:03,555
We've have an injured
     groom and a deceased bride.

198
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:05,757
Oh, they got to that
"till death do us part" nonsense

199
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,892
quickly, didn't they?

200
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:08,994
The bride suffered a
     gunshot wound to the chest.

201
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:10,929
Chest? Shooter didn't go
for the head?

202
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:14,433
First rule of zombie killing.
(sniffs)

203
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:16,234
Do you want to work
       this case with me or not?

204
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:18,503
Of course I do.

205
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:20,639
Every killer must be punished.

206
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:21,773
Good.

207
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,508
Then you stay here.

208
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,509
Find some water.

209
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:26,178
Calm down.

210
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,779
I'm gonna talk
              to some witnesses,

211
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:30,048
and pull yourself together.

212
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,317
You look like a
              homeless magician.

213
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:36,254
(sighs)

214
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:37,656
Well...

215
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:39,658
hello, bridesmaids.

216
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,662
So, which one of you
            horrifying zombettes

217
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:45,797
wanted the bride
                 dead then, hey?

218
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,766
Surely she put each
            of you through hell.

219
00:07:47,768 --> 00:07:48,900
All brides do, am I right?

220
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:50,702
(chuckles)

221
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:52,070
Yeah, let me guess.

222
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:53,238
She wanted you lose weight,

223
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,807
didn't she?
      You to cover your tattoos.

224
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,309
Forced you to buy a
                tea-length dress

225
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:59,945
that does nothing
               for your cankles.

226
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:01,847
And did any of you
            want to wear this...

227
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:03,682
hideous zombie makeup?

228
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:05,717
(sobs)
                      Oh, hello.

229
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:07,486
You look suspicious.

230
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:11,823
Tell me, what did you want
      to do to our corpse bride?

231
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,960
I wanted to ruin her wedding.

232
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:16,161
Ah-ha, right.

233
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,829
Let me guess, you were
         in love with the groom.

234
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,097
This is always about
             jealousy, isn't it?

235
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:21,099
No!
         It was Peggy.

236
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:22,901
Oh, much more
             interesting, go on.

237
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:24,436
She was so disgustingly

238
00:08:24,438 --> 00:08:25,937
perfect, I hated it.

239
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:27,939
How could anyone compare?

240
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:30,542
So remove the
            competition, got it.

241
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:32,244
I told her ex-boyfriend Jason

242
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:33,645
where the wedding was gonna be.
                      Hmm.

243
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:37,582
Hoping he'd... I don't know,
show up and make a scene.

244
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:38,783
Oh.

245
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:42,153
But I never imagined
that he would kill her.

246
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:44,256
(crying):
This is all my fault.

247
00:08:44,258 --> 00:08:46,758
Oh. No, no, no,
                 no, come, come.

248
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,926
Don't do that.

249
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:49,427
Guilt is such
              a useless emotion.

250
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:53,765
It's completely unflattering
       on such a beautiful face.

251
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:56,468
You...

252
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,737
you think I'm beautiful?

253
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:01,506
(chuckles)
Oh!

254
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:04,376
(moaning and squealing)

255
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,378
Lucifer, what
                  are you doing?

256
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,513
Detective,
     I've found you a lead.

257
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:09,648
Where-- in her mouth?

258
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:10,649
Yes, actually!

259
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:12,450
Imagine what I can find
       in other orifices.

260
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:14,886
Ooh!
           (chuckles)

261
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,154
Okay.

262
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:19,491
I apologize.
        I'm just being thorough.

263
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:21,293
Call me. Easy!

264
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:26,498
(indistinct chatter)

265
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,999
CHLOE:
   What has gotten into you?

266
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:29,434
I thought you were getting
       the hang of this.

267
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:30,802
LUCIFER:
  I got you a lead, didn't I?

268
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:33,004
The ex-boyfriend,
you looking into him?

269
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:34,839
Yeah, Dan's on it, but
           that's not the point.

270
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:37,275
This whole new thing, you
      making out with witnesses?

271
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:39,477
Completely inappropriate.

272
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,580
When are you going to get it?
Inappropriate is what I do.

273
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:42,981
You've always been
  a pain in the ass, Lucifer,

274
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:45,317
but I've never
      seen you like this.

275
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:47,452
What's going on?
         What happened?

276
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:48,453
Just enough of the questioning,
Detective.

277
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:50,188
Reprimand me
or let's get on with it.

278
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,189
(scoffs)

279
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:52,223
DAN:
Wow.

280
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:54,726
Can I talk to you, please?

281
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:56,261
(groans)
             Pull your pants up.

282
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:57,262
Hi.

283
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:58,413
Hey, what's up with him?

284
00:09:58,414 --> 00:09:59,563
Looks like he just rolled out
of bed or something.

285
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:00,565
CHLOE:
I don't know.

286
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:01,566
There's just something

287
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:02,334
completely off
                about him today.

288
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:03,335
Yeah, well, there's something's

289
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:04,669
really off about him every day.

290
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,670
No, no, it's different.

291
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:07,005
He's missing his usual...

292
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:08,873
extreme glee.

293
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:12,077
He-he just seems really dark.
Look, is he gonna be a problem?

294
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,812
'Cause you know I wouldn't mind
if you send him home.

295
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:14,813
Nope, not a problem.
You sure?

296
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:16,081
Yep, got it.
                I can handle it.

297
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,515
What'd you get from ballistics?

298
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:18,650
I confirmed

299
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:20,485
large caliber bullet
from a rifle; long-range.

300
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:22,053
I have a team searching a wider
perimeter for more evidence.

301
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:23,989
(door swings open)
And I finished

302
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:25,890
the background check
on everyone at the wedding.

303
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:27,459
All clean.

304
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:28,860
But the ex-boyfriend,
Jason Myers, he's not.

305
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:31,396
He's got one aggravated assault,
two weapons violations.

306
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:33,231
I have him waiting in
interrogation for you.

307
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,678
Well...

308
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,114
hello, bad guy.

309
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:51,316
¶ ¶

310
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,224
DAN: Lucifer,
             open the damn door!

311
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:00,325
(banging on door)
                          CHLOE:
                        Lucifer!

312
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:03,395
Lucifer, open this
                 door right now!

313
00:11:03,397 --> 00:11:05,664
(sobbing)

314
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:09,934
Lucifer, what
                  are you doing?

315
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:10,935
(sighs)

316
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:12,537
Just having a little
chitchat

317
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:13,805
with our friend here.

318
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:15,573
Care to know
              what I've learned?

319
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:17,709
You get out
                   of there now.

320
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:20,879
Oh, she's so demanding.

321
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,820
Well... he's innocent.

322
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:30,588
CHLOE: Oh, did you
figure that out

323
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,524
before or after
       you tortured him?

324
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:33,725
You tortured a suspect?

325
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:35,493
I didn't lay a finger
on the spineless cretin.

326
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:36,995
Come on, the guy's
  sitting on the floor crying.

327
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:38,830
Crying because
of a woman,

328
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:41,066
not me-- the bride,
to be specific.

329
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:42,834
However, he did not
kill her.

330
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:43,968
And you know that how?

331
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,670
He said he couldn't take
seeing the bride so happy,

332
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:48,540
so he ran off, crying--
surprise, surprise--

333
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,842
well before
the shooting started.

334
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:52,077
And you believed that?

335
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,845
Of course not.
He had an alibi.
                         Really?

336
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:56,114
Yes. Leaving the park
on the service road,

337
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:58,083
he bumped into
a wedding musician.

338
00:11:58,085 --> 00:12:00,852
Didn't get a name, but he had
a buzz cut and a guitar case.

339
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:03,188
A guitar? No.

340
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,989
They booked a DJ,
                not a live band.

341
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,525
Trust me, crying guy
isn't lying.

342
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:10,428
Maybe, but maybe there wasn't
     a guitar in that case.

343
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:13,565
Oh, so you think our musician
might be the shooter.

344
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,767
He's pretty shaken up,
         but he's gonna be okay.

345
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:16,868
You're lucky.

346
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,670
Okay, I still have
     to question properly.

347
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:21,272
But there's a possibility
  that Jason saw our shooter,

348
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:23,808
and he may have been carrying
  his rifle in a guitar case.

349
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,844
Last seen
on the park service road.

350
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:28,012
I'm on it.

351
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:32,684
You're welcome.
                      Excuse me?

352
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:34,886
What you just did in there
    is incredibly inappropriate.

353
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:36,888
Are you trying

354
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:37,889
to get in trouble
               or are you trying

355
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:39,057
to piss me off?

356
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:40,525
I did what I had to do.

357
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:42,160
Got results, didn't I?

358
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:43,928
If you pull one more
                stunt like that,

359
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,464
I don't care how
              effective you are,

360
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:47,766
I will bench you.

361
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,919
(single note resonates)

362
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:12,390
I take it you heard about Uriel?

363
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:18,730
Is Lucifer here?

364
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:20,365
No, he's out.

365
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:23,001
Probably in the middle
of some three-way,

366
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:24,769
like nothing happened.

367
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:27,338
Not everyone grieves
                   the same way.

368
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:31,342
Lucifer, he's never
                  been one to...

369
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:33,978
face his emotions.

370
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,215
Instead of looking in,
                    he acts out.

371
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:39,584
You know,
               a rebellion here,

372
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:42,253
an apple there?

373
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,789
But you...

374
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,558
How are you doing?

375
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:50,995
Come on, tell your mom.

376
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:53,832
When I first heard
of Uriel's death,

377
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:55,099
I wanted to blame Lucifer.

378
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:58,603
but... then I realized
I was just as much to blame,

379
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:01,873
if not more.

380
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:02,974
None of this
      would have happened

381
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:04,943
if I still had my...

382
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:06,845
Your powers.

383
00:14:08,582 --> 00:14:09,747
How did you know?

384
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:12,116
A mother knows.

385
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:18,156
But I also know
                   it's possible

386
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:21,960
to regain your strength.

387
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:23,094
That we both can.

388
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:25,463
No, Mom, it's too late.

389
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:28,266
Uriel would...

390
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:31,269
He would still be alive
if it wasn't for me.

391
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,342
Come, there's something
                you need to see.

392
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:48,653
Okay, so we found something
          near the service road.

393
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:52,223
Look at this.

394
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,027
It's a nice little hiding
        spot behind some bushes.

395
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:57,528
Disturbed ground.

396
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,997
Clear view of the stage.

397
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:01,266
Someone with a rifle
        could've made this shot.

398
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:02,834
What's that?

399
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:04,035
That...

400
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:05,803
is a pastry napkin
        from a Dutch food truck.

401
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:08,206
"Freddy's Dutch Oven"?
            (sniffs)

402
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,575
Love this place.
       Unfortunate name,

403
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:11,910
but best stroopwafel
         in Hollywood.

404
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,912
The napkin is
          definitely from today.

405
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:15,213
The syrup is still
               wet to the touch.

406
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:16,881
And undoubtedly tasty.

407
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:19,584
So if the shooter bought this
stroop-- whatever you call it--

408
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,886
with his credit card,
we can track his identity.

409
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:23,087
So we need to
get to the food truck

410
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,522
and talk to the owner.

411
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:25,523
I will put out a BOLO.

412
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:27,158
What is it with you
and BOLOs?

413
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,792
Why don't you just use
Freddy's Dutch Oven app?

414
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:30,328
Gives you their
current locale.

415
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,863
You never know
    when you're in the mood

416
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:33,364
for a good strooping.

417
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:39,637
¶ You better mount up ¶

418
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:43,207
¶ You better ride on ¶

419
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:46,611
¶ You better run ¶

420
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,846
¶ Run away ¶

421
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:50,815
¶ ¶

422
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:52,050
You know what?

423
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:53,318
You stay here.

424
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,553
Don't move.
            I'll do the talking.

425
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:58,356
Fine by me.

426
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:00,558
Detective Decker, LAPD.
Are you the owner?

427
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,094
Alfred Loomis, but
         you can call me Freddy.

428
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:05,029
And let me guess.
         You look like

429
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:06,564
a "chocolade hagelslag"
         kind of girl.

430
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:07,565
Am I right?

431
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:08,766
Sir, earlier today
you served a man

432
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:10,234
with a buzz cut, possibly
carrying a guitar case.

433
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:11,469
Does that ring a bell?

434
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:14,706
If I may, one order
    of "oliebollen," please.

435
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:15,974
What?

436
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:17,008
Oliebollen.

437
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,609
Literally means
         "oily balls."

438
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:20,478
Tastes better than it sounds,
          believe me.

439
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,981
Thank you.
     No, sorry, Detective,

440
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,148
I don't remember
       anyone like that.

441
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,217
But I wasn't here
   during the morning shift.

442
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:28,419
Um, Freddy, I forgot
                     to tell you

443
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:30,521
a guy like that was
             here when I opened.

444
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:33,024
He was asking when
                you'd be around.

445
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:34,559
Asking for me specifically?

446
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:36,427
Actually, you know what?
  Make the two orders, please.

447
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:37,428
I'm famished.
  (impatient groans, murmurs)

448
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,264
Lucifer--
           (gunshots)

449
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:42,133
Everybody down!
       (panicked screams)

450
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:46,637
(sirens approaching)

451
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,573
Shooter on the roof.
      Victim in the truck.

452
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:49,640
Secure the scene!

453
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:52,610
Bloody hell!

454
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:11,329
(seagulls cawing)

455
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:34,652
(distant siren wailing)

456
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:36,921
Not very polite
         of Mr. Shooter to leave

457
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:38,322
without saying good-bye.

458
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:40,425
His bullets are saying plenty.

459
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:42,060
Well, why shoot
              Food Truck Freddy,

460
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:43,461
just 'cause you were
                questioning him?

461
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:46,464
No, this was premeditated.

462
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:48,199
The shooter came here
to find him,

463
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:49,534
then went to shoot the bride,

464
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:51,803
then came back when
he knew Freddy would be here.

465
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:59,510
This guy's got a list.

466
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:00,812
God, who's next?

467
00:18:00,814 --> 00:18:03,681
(chuckles)
       <i> He's</i> not gonna tell you.

468
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,590
Come bloody on!

469
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:13,825
(sighs)

470
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:15,660
(banging on machine)

471
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:17,995
What are you doing?

472
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:19,697
That's twice now today
I've been denied snacks.

473
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:20,932
You got change
for a hundie?

474
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:22,751
Oh, God.

475
00:18:22,752 --> 00:18:24,569
All right, ballistics confirmed
         the same rifle was used

476
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:27,738
in both shootings, but no prints
      were found on the rooftop.

477
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,107
This guy paid cash
              at the food truck.

478
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:32,877
He really covers
                     his tracks.

479
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:34,579
If I could just
       find a connection

480
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:36,747
between our two victims.

481
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:38,616
But Peggy Russo
and Freddy Loomis

482
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,151
seem to have
nothing in common.

483
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:41,719
LUCIFER:
     Apart from being dead.

484
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:44,655
Uh, maybe they were
           just randomly chosen.

485
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:45,823
Mm, my gut says no.

486
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:47,492
This guy is too calculating.

487
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:48,759
Deliberate.

488
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:50,862
Until we find a link
       between these t--

489
00:18:50,864 --> 00:18:53,030
Teeny-tiny doughnuts,
      or cool ranch puffs?

490
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:55,566
Lucifer, you can't
                 just steal food

491
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:57,635
in the middle
                of the precinct.
Why?

492
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:58,903
Are you gonna put me
on the naughty step,

493
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:00,805
so I can have a think
about what I've done?

494
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,540
(cell phone rings)

495
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:04,609
Hey, Monkey.

496
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:06,277
Yes, yeah, I-I'm
                   really sorry.

497
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,279
Work got busy.

498
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:10,915
Yes, I really, really want
  to take you trick-or-treating.

499
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:13,151
But if Mommy or Daddy
     can't make it home in time,

500
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:15,653
Babysitter Shelly might
    have to take you, okay?

501
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,388
Oh, she already left.

502
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,357
What? Why?
         I don't know.

503
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:20,925
But when she went
       into Maze's room,

504
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:22,927
she ran out screaming.

505
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:24,529
It was hilarious.

506
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:27,064
Who's watching you now?
             Maze.

507
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:29,500
Can she take me
       trick-or-treating?

508
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:30,935
No.
                  Mommy, please?

509
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:32,770
I promise I'll be good.

510
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:35,406
Yeah, babe, it's not you
    that I'm worried about.

511
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:37,108
Please, please,
        please, please?

512
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,076
(huffs)

513
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:40,745
All right,
     put Maze on the phone.

514
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:45,016
Yeah?

515
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:46,250
What did you do
       to the babysitter?

516
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:47,251
Me?

517
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:48,119
She's the one
who didn't knock.

518
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:49,854
I had no time
to hide my toys.

519
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:52,690
Okay, Maze, look,
   I have a favor to ask you.

520
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:53,891
That's Lucifer's thing.

521
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:56,227
I know, but I'll never
    find a sitter this late.

522
00:19:56,229 --> 00:20:00,431
And trick-or-treating is really
   important to Trixie, Maze.

523
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:01,866
Will you please
        take her for me?

524
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:05,703
Sure, I'll take your
offspring for a walk.

525
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,705
Well, she's not a dog,
         but thank you.

526
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:10,474
Okay, don't let her
       out of your sight,

527
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:13,077
please check her candy,
      and take her early,

528
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,278
like 3:00.
             Great.

529
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,581
Best after-parties don't start
       till 3:00 anyway.

530
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,716
Not 3:00 a.m., 3:00 p.m.

531
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:19,984
I want her home before dark.

532
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:21,953
And do not take her
        to any parties.

533
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:23,321
(scoffs)
             Lame.

534
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:24,322
But whatever, your kid.

535
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:25,990
Thank you.
       Thank you so much.

536
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:28,326
Oh, oh, did you see the costume?
     I laid it on the bed.

537
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:30,861
Uh...

538
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,300
What's wrong?

539
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:39,403
I told Mommy I wanted to be
  a princess when I was seven.

540
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:40,605
Now I'm eight.

541
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:42,039
And?

542
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,975
Halloween's supposed to be
     the one night you get

543
00:20:43,977 --> 00:20:46,043
to be whatever you want.

544
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:53,417
What do you want to be?

545
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,560
Where did he go?

546
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:06,130
Hey. I've been talking to
    the food truck owner's wife.

547
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:07,465
She doesn't recognize
               the zombie bride,

548
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:10,067
and doesn't think she has
 any connection to her husband.

549
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:14,939
Two victims,
two devastated spouses.

550
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:18,376
Maybe we're looking
     at this the wrong way.

551
00:21:23,816 --> 00:21:25,416
Mrs. Loomis, I'm sorry.

552
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:27,251
I know you're going
                  through a lot.

553
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:29,787
I have one more
         question for you, okay?

554
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,489
Do you recognize this man?

555
00:21:31,491 --> 00:21:33,958
Yes, that's Edgar... Romero.

556
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,026
How do you know him?

557
00:21:35,028 --> 00:21:36,427
We've worked together.

558
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:37,428
I'm a doctor.

559
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,629
He's a lawyer.

560
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,197
He handles many

561
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:42,266
of our hospital's
malpractice suits.

562
00:21:42,268 --> 00:21:43,934
He's married

563
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:45,202
to the other victim?
                        Yes, but

564
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:46,537
the connection
     we've been looking for

565
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:47,672
isn't between them;

566
00:21:47,674 --> 00:21:49,473
it's between you, the spouses.

567
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:50,608
So, you think
             the shooter's upset

568
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,276
because of one of these
              malpractice suits?

569
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:53,277
CHLOE:
Maybe.

570
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:54,779
Maybe he's taking it out

571
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:56,280
on their loved ones.

572
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,783
Can you give us a list
        of all the cases

573
00:21:58,785 --> 00:22:00,384
that Edgar litigated for you?

574
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:07,692
CHLOE:
   When are you gonna tell me
   what's going on with you?

575
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:08,693
Do you want to talk about it?

576
00:22:08,695 --> 00:22:09,694
LUCIFER:
  Why would I want to do that?

577
00:22:09,696 --> 00:22:10,695
'Cause that's
               what partners do.

578
00:22:10,697 --> 00:22:11,696
They talk.

579
00:22:11,698 --> 00:22:13,097
I can tell you
              about my headaches

580
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:14,865
living with Maze
      and you can tell me

581
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:16,200
what's going on with you.

582
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:18,135
Pass.

583
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:19,337
Lucifer,

584
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:20,705
seriously,

585
00:22:20,707 --> 00:22:22,239
whatever you're going through...

586
00:22:22,241 --> 00:22:23,974
I don't know, maybe I can help.

587
00:22:23,976 --> 00:22:25,242
(snorts)
              How?

588
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:26,977
By giving me a warm, fuzzy hug?

589
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:29,113
They won't release
the damn case files.

590
00:22:29,115 --> 00:22:31,649
Some crap about new HIPAA laws
requiring extra warrants.

591
00:22:31,651 --> 00:22:34,285
It could be days before we get
  a judge to sign off on that.

592
00:22:34,287 --> 00:22:36,253
Oh, well, it looks like
  Detective Douche is the one

593
00:22:36,255 --> 00:22:38,022
who needs a hug.
     Mm, come here, Daniel.

594
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:39,557
Mm.
      Get off me, man.

595
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:41,659
Uh, Daniel, if you want
    to talk about your feelings,

596
00:22:41,661 --> 00:22:43,160
Detective Decker is offering.

597
00:22:43,162 --> 00:22:44,261
Why don't give
you two a minute

598
00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:45,262
so you can
talk about your

599
00:22:45,264 --> 00:22:48,632
earth-shattering problems.

600
00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:49,900
What was that?
                      I told you

601
00:22:49,902 --> 00:22:51,268
something's going on with him.

602
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,837
I'm getting worried.
Yeah, well,

603
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,071
honestly, Chloe,
     we have bigger things

604
00:22:54,073 --> 00:22:55,406
to worry about right now.
                         I know.

605
00:22:55,408 --> 00:22:57,108
I'll see if I can expedite
         the warrants,

606
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:59,210
and, uh, call the lieutenant.

607
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:01,479
Right. Here you go.

608
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:02,747
Merry Christmas.

609
00:23:02,749 --> 00:23:04,648
Or should I say,
        Happy Halloween.

610
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:05,649
Are these the files?

611
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:07,017
Where did you get these?

612
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:08,352
Well, if you ask permission,
              people can say no,

613
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:09,754
but flash a badge
                to the right sap

614
00:23:09,756 --> 00:23:11,355
and voilà.

615
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:13,858
This is mine.

616
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,292
All right, chill out, Daniel.

617
00:23:15,294 --> 00:23:17,128
What's a little badge borrowing
        between friends?

618
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,163
I mean, at least I didn't have
          to use this.

619
00:23:19,165 --> 00:23:21,031
You stole my gun and my badge?

620
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:22,533
What the hell is
the matter with you?!

621
00:23:22,535 --> 00:23:23,657
Hey, guys...

622
00:23:23,658 --> 00:23:24,780
Are you gonna take his side
       in this right now?

623
00:23:24,781 --> 00:23:25,903
Is that what you're doing?
          Well, I got the files,

624
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,772
didn't I?
    I did what I had to do.

625
00:23:27,774 --> 00:23:28,973
Oh, please,
    don't give me that crap.

626
00:23:28,975 --> 00:23:30,508
You never do
      what you have to do,

627
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,776
Lucifer.

628
00:23:31,778 --> 00:23:33,043
You only ever do
       what you want to.

629
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:34,545
That is not true.

630
00:23:34,547 --> 00:23:37,047
There's a lot of things
   that I didn't want to do.

631
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:38,149
Oh, really?
                            Yes.

632
00:23:38,151 --> 00:23:39,216
Because if I only ever did

633
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:40,217
what I wanted to do,

634
00:23:40,219 --> 00:23:41,886
then right now, I'd do this.

635
00:23:41,888 --> 00:23:44,121
(Daniel groaning)

636
00:23:45,558 --> 00:23:47,925
What the hell is wrong
           with you?!

637
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,593
Why are you so surprised,
          Detective?!

638
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:50,661
I'm the Devil, remember?

639
00:23:50,663 --> 00:23:51,762
I'm evil!

640
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:52,930
No, what you are
       is off this case.

641
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:55,232
You go home now.
          You're done.

642
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,069
Go!

643
00:24:06,345 --> 00:24:07,344
CHLOE:
                   Are you okay?

644
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:08,913
Not really.
              All right, well...

645
00:24:08,915 --> 00:24:11,982
let's get you checked out
     and return the files.

646
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:13,617
What if we hold off for a bit?

647
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,386
I don't agree

648
00:24:15,388 --> 00:24:17,154
with what Lucifer did.

649
00:24:17,156 --> 00:24:19,657
But there's still
      a killer out there.

650
00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:21,759
And these files might be
    the key to stopping him.

651
00:24:21,761 --> 00:24:23,761
Are you suggesting we keep them?

652
00:24:23,763 --> 00:24:25,362
More like borrow.

653
00:24:26,732 --> 00:24:28,165
AMENADIEL:
    Where are we going, Mom?

654
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:29,400
You'll see soon enough.

655
00:24:29,402 --> 00:24:31,302
But first, we need to get
      something straight.

656
00:24:31,304 --> 00:24:34,338
Uriel's death was
                 not your fault.

657
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:37,808
How can you say that, Mom?

658
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:40,978
Do you remember when
            you boys were young?

659
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,547
Uriel always playing
               pranks on Lucifer

660
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:45,249
to get your
             Father's attention?

661
00:24:45,251 --> 00:24:47,084
Annoying little runt.

662
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:48,953
And he never got
               in trouble for it

663
00:24:48,955 --> 00:24:50,788
because you
                 took the blame.

664
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:53,424
Just looking out
for my little brother, Mom.

665
00:24:53,426 --> 00:24:55,192
No, it's more than that.

666
00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:58,229
You have welcomed responsibility
       your entire life.

667
00:24:58,231 --> 00:25:00,564
Don't you think
      you deserve a break?

668
00:25:00,566 --> 00:25:03,100
Mom, you just don't understand.

669
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:05,536
Don't you think I
          feel responsible, too?

670
00:25:05,538 --> 00:25:07,705
All of this
               fighting has been

671
00:25:07,707 --> 00:25:10,107
over me.

672
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:12,443
Uriel is gone forever
         because of me,

673
00:25:12,445 --> 00:25:13,944
not you.

674
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:15,813
How can you say that, Mom?

675
00:25:15,815 --> 00:25:17,381
You did everything

676
00:25:17,383 --> 00:25:18,382
that you could do.

677
00:25:18,384 --> 00:25:19,884
You volunteered
      to go back to Hell.

678
00:25:19,886 --> 00:25:22,119
You stepped up
    and did the right thing.

679
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:23,420
Isn't that all
              you've been doing?

680
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:25,155
Trying to please
                     your Father

681
00:25:25,157 --> 00:25:27,057
by doing what you
                 think is right?

682
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:30,427
You shouldn't be punished.

683
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:32,530
You should be rewarded.

684
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:35,566
¶ Oh, Father, tell me... ¶

685
00:25:35,568 --> 00:25:37,468
You really think so?

686
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,836
¶ We get what we... ¶

687
00:25:38,838 --> 00:25:41,705
If your Father was down here...

688
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:43,440
¶ Oh, we get... ¶

689
00:25:43,442 --> 00:25:45,809
...he would see that.

690
00:25:45,811 --> 00:25:48,012
¶ We deserve ¶

691
00:25:49,615 --> 00:25:52,049
¶ And way down ¶

692
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:55,886
¶ We go-o-o-o-o ¶

693
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,821
¶ Oh, way down ¶

694
00:25:57,823 --> 00:26:01,825
¶ We go-o-o-o-o ¶

695
00:26:01,827 --> 00:26:03,627
¶ Say way down ¶

696
00:26:03,629 --> 00:26:06,330
¶ We go ¶

697
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:07,865
¶ Go-o-o-o-o ¶

698
00:26:07,867 --> 00:26:10,968
¶ Way down we go... ¶

699
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:14,138
This is where Lucifer
      buried your brother.

700
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:18,909
¶ Whoa, you let your feet
           run wild ¶

701
00:26:20,346 --> 00:26:21,612
¶ Time has come ¶

702
00:26:21,614 --> 00:26:26,116
¶ As we all, oh, go down ¶

703
00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:31,455
¶ Yeah, but for the fall,
           ooh, my ¶

704
00:26:31,457 --> 00:26:35,359
¶ Do you dare to look him
      right in the eyes? ¶

705
00:26:35,361 --> 00:26:37,127
¶ Yeah... ¶

706
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:38,128
Uriel?

707
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,631
¶ 'Cause they will
         run you down ¶

708
00:26:40,633 --> 00:26:43,400
¶ Down till the dark... ¶

709
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:44,468
(shouts)

710
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,503
I am... so sorry.

711
00:26:46,505 --> 00:26:47,605
WOMAN:
                         Oh, no.

712
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:48,606
No worries.

713
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:50,307
It's not your fault.

714
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:55,312
¶ And they will run you down,
       down till you go ¶

715
00:26:55,314 --> 00:26:58,882
¶ Yeah, so you can't crawl
           no more ¶

716
00:26:58,884 --> 00:27:00,718
¶ Oh ¶

717
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,319
¶ Say way down... ¶

718
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:03,854
Okay, so, these are all
          the cases that involve

719
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:07,725
both Dr. Loomis and
         our zombie groom Edgar.

720
00:27:07,727 --> 00:27:09,660
Six settled, three pending
         and that last one there

721
00:27:09,662 --> 00:27:11,061
was recently dismissed.

722
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:13,831
Wrongful death suit thrown out
     for lack of evidence.

723
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:15,099
That's frustrating.

724
00:27:15,101 --> 00:27:16,667
Could be motive.
         Yeah. I don't know.

725
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:18,802
Maybe our plaintiff was pissed
      about the dismissal,

726
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,804
decided to settle his grievances
          another way.

727
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:23,807
Let's see... plaintiff,
         Wes Williams.

728
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:25,776
He sued for his wife
       Cassandra's death

729
00:27:25,778 --> 00:27:27,911
after she lost a battle with--

730
00:27:27,913 --> 00:27:29,813
oh man, I can't
     even pronounce this--

731
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:33,217
Lymphangioleiomyomatosis?

732
00:27:33,219 --> 00:27:34,785
Yeah. Lung disease.
Yeah, well, it looks like

733
00:27:34,787 --> 00:27:36,153
Wes blamed
     Cassandra's physician,

734
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:38,188
our Dr. Sidney Loomis,
   and the hospital's lawyer,

735
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,090
Edgar Romero,
    got the case thrown out.

736
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:41,392
It's no one's fault
        for a disease like that.

737
00:27:41,394 --> 00:27:42,393
Yeah, well, apparently,

738
00:27:42,395 --> 00:27:45,396
Wes didn't feel that way.

739
00:27:45,398 --> 00:27:46,797
What's wrong?

740
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,198
Nothing, I just...

741
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,267
I kind of feel bad for the guy's
      situation, you know?

742
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:55,739
I mean, I-I don't know
 what I would do if my wife...

743
00:27:55,741 --> 00:27:58,242
Yeah, right.

744
00:27:58,244 --> 00:27:59,943
Well, what you wouldn't do
    is start revenge killing

745
00:27:59,945 --> 00:28:02,279
a bunch of innocent people.

746
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:04,114
Good point.

747
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:07,451
Okay, let's see if our Wes
      Williams is in the system.

748
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,289
(computer beeps)

749
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:13,691
No criminal record.

750
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:15,926
But he fits the description.

751
00:28:16,729 --> 00:28:19,530
Look at that.

752
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:20,964
He's an ATF agent.

753
00:28:20,966 --> 00:28:22,900
Nicknamed "The Ghost."

754
00:28:22,902 --> 00:28:24,268
He served multiple
assignments in Mexico

755
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,469
trying to take down
the cartels.

756
00:28:25,471 --> 00:28:26,837
Specializes in...

757
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:29,306
long-range marksmanship.

758
00:28:29,308 --> 00:28:31,175
Let's go.

759
00:28:31,177 --> 00:28:32,710
OFFICER:
                 Go! Other side.

760
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:34,344
Hallway clear.

761
00:28:36,482 --> 00:28:37,548
Clear!

762
00:28:39,085 --> 00:28:41,185
OFFICER:
Clear!
                  Clear.

763
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:49,860
He's making counterfeit badges

764
00:28:49,862 --> 00:28:52,496
for Strode Pharmaceuticals.

765
00:29:14,687 --> 00:29:16,353
(cackling)
        (doorbell rings)

766
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:20,157
¶ Well, once a year,
  there's a hellish night... ¶

767
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:21,792
Trick or treat!

768
00:29:21,794 --> 00:29:24,962
Oh, and what are you,
          young lady?

769
00:29:24,964 --> 00:29:27,197
MAZE: She's the
              president of Mars.

770
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,432
Duh.

771
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:29,633
Yeah...

772
00:29:29,635 --> 00:29:31,135
duh.

773
00:29:31,137 --> 00:29:34,338
President of Mars!

774
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,539
All right.

775
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:38,275
¶ Spirits rising
      from the ground... ¶

776
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:40,577
¶ Out comes that spooky sound ¶

777
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:44,314
¶ It's a haunted rave ¶

778
00:29:44,316 --> 00:29:46,817
¶<i> It's a haunted rave...</i> ¶

¶<i> Straight from the grave ¶</i>

00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:56,360

¶<i> And the dead will</i> ¶

¶<i> Dance</i> ¶

784

¶ You'd better run
 while you've got the chance. ¶

785
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:08,138
Isn't this fun?

786
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:11,708
I expected worse.

787
00:30:12,845 --> 00:30:13,844
(sighs)

788
00:30:13,846 --> 00:30:16,013
I wish you
wore a costume.

789
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:19,616
Well, I, uh...

790
00:30:19,618 --> 00:30:22,686
I did bring something.

791
00:30:24,223 --> 00:30:25,856
Do you want to see it?

792
00:30:25,858 --> 00:30:26,957
Yeah.

793
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:29,827
Turn around.

794
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:32,963
(whooshing and low rumble)

795
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:34,164
I'm ready.

796
00:30:39,471 --> 00:30:41,104
Cool!

797
00:30:41,106 --> 00:30:42,406
(exhales nervously)

798
00:30:42,408 --> 00:30:43,841
We're gonna get so much candy.

799
00:30:44,977 --> 00:30:46,777
(chuckles)

800
00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:48,979
(indistinct conversation)

801
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:07,130
(piano key plays slowly)

802
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:11,735
(playing
   Metallica's "Unforgiven")

803
00:31:23,148 --> 00:31:24,481
Why?

804
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:25,515
Why did you bring me here?

805
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:26,516
You have been

806
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:28,685
so focused on blame...

807
00:31:28,687 --> 00:31:31,521
you haven't let yourself grieve.

808
00:31:31,523 --> 00:31:33,390
This isn't right.

809
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,659
None of it.

810
00:31:35,661 --> 00:31:37,227
Why did he do this?

811
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:38,295
Lucifer was just trying...

812
00:31:38,297 --> 00:31:39,396
No, Mom.

813
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,765
Not Lucifer, Father.

814
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:47,104
How did He let this happen?

815
00:31:47,106 --> 00:31:49,172
Son, it's okay.

816
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:51,508
Just let it out.

817
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:54,912
Let it all... out.

818
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:00,317
(continues playing
       "The Unforgiven")

819
00:32:13,299 --> 00:32:15,933
AMENADIEL:
   <i> I blame Father for this.</i>

820
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:17,734
<i> You're right, Mom,</i>
         <i> where is he?</i>

821
00:32:17,736 --> 00:32:19,603
If he wanted to,
he could've prevented

822
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:21,605
all of this from happening.

823
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:25,208
All the misunderstandings,
all the pain.

824
00:32:26,211 --> 00:32:27,744
Well, I'm done.

825
00:32:27,746 --> 00:32:31,815
I'm done trying to please
someone who isn't ever here.

          DAN: Yeah. Right here.

00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:31,908
Wes Williams' took part in one
 of their clinical drug trials.

836
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,710
A "promising new treatment"
for her lung disease.

837
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:35,078
Not promising enough
                    to save her.

838
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,080
No. Turns out she was
in the placebo group.

839
00:33:37,082 --> 00:33:39,082
Is that why he's pissed off?
              Who put her there?

840
00:33:39,084 --> 00:33:41,084
No one, really.
     It was a double-blind,

841
00:33:41,086 --> 00:33:43,453
so just like the doctor and the
lawyer, no one's at fault here.

842
00:33:43,455 --> 00:33:44,988
So who does our shooter
              think is at fault?

843
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,223
Who ran the trials?

844
00:33:46,225 --> 00:33:48,058
Dr. Jack Peterson.

845
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,860
And since Williams
     is targeting spouses,

846
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:51,628
if we find Mrs. Peterson,
          assuming...

847
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,130
No, wait... crap.
What?

848
00:33:53,132 --> 00:33:55,799
It also says that the trial was
  run by a Dr. Sally Peterson.

849
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:57,267
They're a husband and wife team.

850
00:33:57,269 --> 00:33:58,935
Great. Who's the target?

851
00:33:58,937 --> 00:34:00,971
Well, it could be either one.
We got to get to both of them.

852
00:34:00,973 --> 00:34:02,739
Yeah, before he does.

853
00:34:04,443 --> 00:34:05,442
Dr. Peterson?

854
00:34:05,444 --> 00:34:06,576
LAPD.
Your wife, Sally.

855
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:08,245
Where is she?
        What's going on?

856
00:34:08,247 --> 00:34:10,447
I'll explain later.
Where's your wife?

857
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:11,448
Probably getting a coffee from

858
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:12,449
the coffee cart
in the lobby.

859
00:34:12,451 --> 00:34:13,617
Okay, you stay with him.
         I'll find her.

860
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:15,786
You be careful.
                          Right.

861
00:34:15,788 --> 00:34:16,787
You stay put.

862
00:34:16,789 --> 00:34:19,189
Here you go.
                Thank you.

863
00:34:26,298 --> 00:34:28,799
I know you're out there,
          Mr. Sniper!

864
00:34:37,342 --> 00:34:38,675
(gunshot)

865
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:41,011
Oh, come on!

866
00:34:41,013 --> 00:34:43,747
LUCIFER:
  You can do better than that!

867
00:34:45,317 --> 00:34:46,450
(exhales)

868
00:34:46,452 --> 00:34:47,818
Shoot me!

869
00:34:53,025 --> 00:34:55,025
Well, go on, then!

870
00:34:55,027 --> 00:34:57,027
What are you waiting for?

871
00:34:57,029 --> 00:34:59,029
Just shoot me right now. Please!

872
00:34:59,031 --> 00:35:00,897
Lucifer, what are you doing?
Uh-oh!

873
00:35:00,899 --> 00:35:02,165
Police are here!

874
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:04,501
Gonna have to hurry up,
       Mr. Shooter, sir.

875
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:07,904
(screaming)

876
00:35:07,906 --> 00:35:10,373
Seriously? I mean,
    I'm standing right here.

877
00:35:16,181 --> 00:35:18,081
Right. You're just
  embarrassing yourself, now.

878
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:20,484
I mean, could you be
      any worse of a shot?

879
00:35:23,922 --> 00:35:25,355
(gunshot)

880
00:35:26,058 --> 00:35:27,958
LUCIFER:
          Oh, come on.

881
00:35:30,696 --> 00:35:33,230
Che... It's like
     he's not even trying.

882
00:35:39,404 --> 00:35:41,671
Not her, you idiot-- me!

883
00:35:41,673 --> 00:35:43,140
Shoot me!

884
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:50,013
Drop your weapon now.

885
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:01,992
(distant sirens wailing)

886
00:36:06,565 --> 00:36:08,899
You.

887
00:36:08,901 --> 00:36:10,233
Why didn't you shoot me?

888
00:36:10,235 --> 00:36:12,235
Shoot you?
I was standing

889
00:36:12,237 --> 00:36:14,671
right here, fair game.
Why didn't you do it?

890
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,072
Because you didn't
                     deserve it.

891
00:36:16,074 --> 00:36:18,408
How do you know what I deserve?

892
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,777
I was trying to scare
              you away from her.

893
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:22,412
I only wanted the people
            who killed Cassandra

894
00:36:22,414 --> 00:36:23,413
to suffer like...

895
00:36:23,415 --> 00:36:24,581
What...?

896
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:27,417
Like I'm suffering.

897
00:36:27,419 --> 00:36:28,852
You idiot!

898
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:30,253
Lucifer.
The doctor,

899
00:36:30,255 --> 00:36:32,122
the lawyer, that woman--
they didn't kill your wife!

900
00:36:32,124 --> 00:36:33,857
They aren't responsible!

901
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,293
But you know that.

902
00:36:36,295 --> 00:36:39,829
You hold someone else
accountable, don't you?

903
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:43,967
If I hadn't been
     on mission so long...

904
00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:46,803
Been home when
     Cassandra needed me...

905
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:48,972
we could've detected it sooner.

906
00:36:48,974 --> 00:36:52,209
She would still be alive.

907
00:36:52,211 --> 00:36:54,077
Yes.

908
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,346
So it's not vengeance you want.

909
00:36:56,348 --> 00:36:57,647
It's punishment.

910
00:37:02,588 --> 00:37:04,888
Well, now you've got it.

911
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,623
Good for you.

912
00:37:13,365 --> 00:37:14,431
I got this.

913
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:18,335
Hey.

914
00:37:21,006 --> 00:37:22,305
How did you find us?

915
00:37:22,307 --> 00:37:24,007
Just called the station chief.

916
00:37:24,009 --> 00:37:25,508
Got all the details.

917
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:28,845
What you just did was
  extremely reckless and stupid.

918
00:37:28,847 --> 00:37:29,913
(scoffs)

919
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:31,581
But you saved
              that woman's life.

920
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:34,317
I couldn't care less
about that woman's life.

921
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:37,387
So, what, you were just trying
         to get yourself killed?

922
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,689
No.

923
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:40,857
I don't buy it.

924
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:43,093
Every time you say
            that you don't care,

925
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:45,328
or that you're evil,
            or you're the Devil,

926
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:47,597
I know that's not
             who you really are.

927
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,966
You don't know a thing
about who I am, Detective.

928
00:37:49,968 --> 00:37:51,334
Or what I've done.

929
00:37:51,336 --> 00:37:54,938
You weren't just talking about
       Wes back there, were you?

930
00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:58,975
You want to be punished
                  for something.

931
00:37:58,977 --> 00:38:01,077
That's why you've been
            acting out recently.

932
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:04,114
Just talk to me,
                Lucifer, please.

933
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:06,683
Just tell me what's going on.

934
00:38:06,685 --> 00:38:09,085
I'm here for you, okay? I...

935
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:13,123
I just want to understand.

936
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,560
You can't understand, Detective.

937
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:22,465
And you never will.

938
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:27,137
Well, if you won't
             talk to me, then...

939
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:29,839
please, talk to someone else.

940
00:38:29,841 --> 00:38:32,409
You have a therapist.

941
00:38:32,411 --> 00:38:35,979
Talk to her,
   before it eats you alive.

00:39:19,124 --> 00:39:22,125
I'm glad you
              changed your mind.

951
00:39:25,197 --> 00:39:28,431
Are you ready to talk
      about your brother?

952
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:35,004
His name is...

953
00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:38,375
<i> was</i> Uriel.

954
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:41,678
And ever since he died,

955
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,214
I've been having this...
        strange feeling.

956
00:39:44,216 --> 00:39:47,884
Something I've never
          felt before.

957
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:49,786
Guilt.

958
00:39:50,822 --> 00:39:54,224
Why do you feel guilty?

959
00:39:57,329 --> 00:39:59,529
Uriel didn't just die.

960
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:02,899
I killed him.

961
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:04,734
I've never...

962
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:07,704
killed anyone before. Only
punished those already dead.

963
00:40:07,706 --> 00:40:11,674
You know, back when
I used to run Hell.

964
00:40:11,676 --> 00:40:13,209
But...
(drinks)

965
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:16,346
A stubborn Uriel...
he-he gave me no choice.

966
00:40:16,348 --> 00:40:18,481
He came down
from the Silver City

967
00:40:18,483 --> 00:40:20,550
to collect on the deal
     that I made with Dad.

968
00:40:20,552 --> 00:40:24,387
Intent on killing the detective
or smiting Mum out of existence.

969
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:26,356
Lucifer...
He brought Azrael's
blade with him,

970
00:40:26,358 --> 00:40:28,358
which is a... a divine dagger
    that destroys your soul,

971
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,759
it doesn't just kill you.

972
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:31,761
It... wipes you out...
                Lucifer, enough.

974
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:37,434
I can't do this anymore.

975
00:40:38,904 --> 00:40:41,871
I can't keep track of all these
      elaborate metaphors.

976
00:40:41,873 --> 00:40:43,706
But it's not a metaphor,

977
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:45,175
Doctor.

978
00:40:45,177 --> 00:40:46,609
You need to take me seriously.

979
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:49,112
You need to believe
        what I'm saying.

980
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:51,314
Otherwise, you'll
never understand...

981
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:55,518
I'm a monster.

982
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,321
A monster who...
    deserves to be punished.

983
00:40:58,323 --> 00:41:00,757
I believe you
                  feel that way.

984
00:41:00,759 --> 00:41:01,991
(sighs)

985
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:03,960
And I want
                  to understand.

986
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:05,628
I truly do!

987
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,530
But, Lucifer,
      you have to help me.

988
00:41:07,532 --> 00:41:10,033
I need you to be
                 honest with me.

989
00:41:10,035 --> 00:41:12,602
Completely honest...

990
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:16,139
...about who you are.

991
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:18,908
Completely honest?

992
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,243
Are you sure?
                            Yes.

993
00:41:20,245 --> 00:41:22,545
Yes, I'm sure.

994
00:41:22,547 --> 00:41:25,148
That's what all
             of these sessions--

995
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:28,284
our entire relationship--
         is all about.
