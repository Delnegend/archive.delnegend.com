00:00:01,102 --> 00:00:02,434
<i> Previously on</i> Lucifer...

2
00:00:02,436 --> 00:00:04,470
Tell me, what do you desire?

3
00:00:04,472 --> 00:00:06,038
This is it?
This is your big trick?

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,272
Why don't I affect you,
Detective?

5
00:00:07,274 --> 00:00:09,174
I guess we both have
our mysteries.

6
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:11,577
35 years ago, Father asked me
to come down here

7
00:00:11,579 --> 00:00:13,579
to bless a couple who was unable
to have a child.

8
00:00:13,581 --> 00:00:15,848
You look really familiar.
Have we met?

9
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,217
MOM:
<i> Your Father put her</i>
<i> in Lucifer's path.</i>

10
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:19,785
We're going home, son.

11
00:00:19,787 --> 00:00:22,354
<i> And Chloe is the key.</i>

12
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,090
Andy Kleinberg? Jana Lawrence
was found murdered this morning.

13
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:28,293
KLEINBERG:
<i> One of them broke.</i>
<i> I spilled a little on myself.</i>

14
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:29,862
What the hell is happening
to me?

15
00:00:29,864 --> 00:00:32,631
MAZE:
<i> So what if you slept</i>
<i> with Charlotte Richards?</i>

16
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:34,066
You slept with my...

17
00:00:34,068 --> 00:00:35,334
Whoa!

18
00:00:35,336 --> 00:00:37,736
He's different
when he's with you.

19
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:40,339
<i> Chloe Decker</i>
<i>is causing your vulnerability. </i>
I'm bleeding.

20
00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:42,074
Do you think I'm
boyfriend material?

21
00:00:42,076 --> 00:00:43,942
Perhaps you've been
underestimating yourself.

22
00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:46,145

What are you doing in here?

47
00:01:58,853 --> 00:02:01,687
What? I heard you scream,
so I ran in to see

48
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:03,589
if you were in danger.
Then I figured out

49
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:06,024
what was really going on,
you know,

50
00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:07,493
so I stayed to watch the show.

51
00:02:07,495 --> 00:02:08,460
Hey.

52
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,762
What was that--
that thing you were doing?

53
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:11,763
You were like...

54
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:12,998
Okay, Maze,

55
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,600
get out.

56
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:15,968
Now.

57
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,270
All right, at least you're
getting laid in your dreams.

58
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:20,305
'Cause it's not happening
in real life.

59
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:21,874
You don't know that.

60
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:25,711
I just wish you'd loosen up,
Decker.

61
00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:27,613
You know,
throw caution to the wind,

62
00:02:27,615 --> 00:02:29,047
be impulsive,

63
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:30,916
just once.

64
00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:32,818
Instead of, you know,

65
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,486
being you.

66
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,925
(door opens)

67
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:40,926
(door closes)

68
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:45,764
Maybe this time
will be different.

69
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:49,568
This time will definitely
be different, Doctor.

70
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,404
I've decided to
take things slow, for once.

71
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:55,240
Hmm, and why
is that?

72
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:57,943
Because
I'm a responsible Devil.

73
00:02:57,945 --> 00:03:02,881
And I-- well, I know
what a big deal the kiss was...

74
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:04,082
for the detective.

75
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:05,317
For<i> her?</i>

76
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,451
Well, I'm sure
it must have made

77
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:07,452
quite an impact
on her.

78
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:10,155
I mean, it, it is me.

79
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:11,256
No doubt
she's overwhelmed

80
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:13,091
by emotions
she's never felt before.

81
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:14,226
<i> She's</i> overwhelmed?

82
00:03:14,228 --> 00:03:15,460
Mm.
Uh-huh.

83
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:16,828
Is that why
you went your separate ways

84
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:17,863
after the kiss?

85
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,498
Precisely.

86
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,500
Yes, although she did have
that wretched dependent

87
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:22,668
waiting for her at home.

88
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,103
Well, two,
if you count the child.

89
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:27,573
I think I know what's happening.

90
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:29,107
Y-You do?

91
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:30,676
You're stalling, Lucifer.

92
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:32,477
(laughing):
Stalling?

93
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,013
Sex? Me?

94
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:36,381
Doctor, have we even met before?

95
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,383
You're stalling
because you've realized

96
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,819
how complicated
your relationship is.

97
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:42,254
Look...
(sighs)

98
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:45,157
the, um,
the truth is that...

99
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,658
I still don't
understand why,

100
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:51,430
after everything I said about
my less positive qualities,

101
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:53,532
she still chose to kiss me.

102
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:55,334
I mean, do you think she's ill?

103
00:03:55,336 --> 00:03:57,369
Or maybe...

104
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:59,504
she's just taken by you?

105
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:00,839
Well, that's impossible.

106
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:03,675
The detective is
completely immune to my charms.

107
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:09,281
Or she<i> was</i> immune.

108
00:04:09,283 --> 00:04:11,917
Maybe that's what's changed.

109
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,852
Of course, I mean why else
would she kiss me?

110
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:15,287
But there's also
the possibility...

111
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:16,288
No, no, no.

112
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,156
No. That's very good.

113
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:20,392
Thank you, Doctor.

114
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:21,727
I know what to do now.

115
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:23,762
(door opens)

116
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:29,067
Morning.

117
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:31,169
Hey.

118
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:33,038
So, how was the rest
of your night?

119
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,073
It was fine, thank you.

120
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:36,174
How was the rest of your night?

121
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:39,411
Uh, fine, thank you.

122
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:41,046
Excellent. So we're
all fine, then.

123
00:04:41,048 --> 00:04:42,180
But before we deal with

124
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:43,448
whatever
atrocity awaits,

125
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,549
there's something
important

126
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:46,418
I need to ask you,
Detective. It's...

127
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,020
well, it's about us.

128
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:50,022
Okay.

129
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:55,560
So what is it
you truly desire now?

130
00:04:58,465 --> 00:04:59,831
Lucifer, what the
hell are you doing?

131
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,333
You know that stuff
doesn't work on me.

132
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:02,868
Right.

133
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,304
Yes, no, of course.
I was, uh, joking.

134
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:06,505
(chuckles)

135
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:08,373
Right.

136
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:11,410
(laughs)

137
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:15,247
I was just trying to...

138
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:18,417
Maze said this
morning, you know,

139
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:21,353
throw caution to the--
never mind, it...

140
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:24,356
That was weird. Yeah.
We-- let's go.

141
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:25,957
Right.

142
00:05:30,064 --> 00:05:32,097
Right, what have we got?

143
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:35,467
ELLA:
Meet Rick Cormier.

144
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:39,438
19-years-old.
Malibu State freshman.

145
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,441
Friends thought he was just
hungover after the big win

146
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:43,842
against
the Pasadena Gray Hawks.

147
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,377
Turns out, he be dead.

148
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:46,712
Of poisoning.

149
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:47,379
Ooh.

150
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:48,313
Like alcohol poisoning?

151
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:51,149
No, like<i> poison</i> poisoning.

152
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:52,250
Check it out:

153
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:54,386
petechial hemorrhaging,

154
00:05:54,388 --> 00:05:57,089
ribboned skin,

155
00:05:57,091 --> 00:05:59,291
ocular discharge.

156
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:00,559
(chuckles) Sorry,
she said "discharge,"

157
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:01,827
it gets me every time.

158
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:02,861
(laughs)

159
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,198
Any idea

160
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,767
of how long it took
the poison to activate?

161
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:10,535
ELLA: Well, it's hard to say
for sure, but best guess,

162
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:11,803
maybe 24 hours?

163
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:13,805
I hope poor Ricky
made 'em count.

164
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:17,109
Enjoying what little life
he had left with sex or friends.

165
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:19,811
Or sex with friends.

166
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:25,283
I just figured that's where
you were going with that.

167
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:26,318
ELLA: Yeah, well,
I mean, I don't know

168
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,886
how down he
was to party,

169
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,988
but, you guys,

170
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,691
I've seen
a lot of messed up stuff.

171
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:34,493
This toxin tore
through his body

172
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:37,295
like it was burning him
from the inside out.

173
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:38,797
I mean,
I'm gonna have to reach out

174
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:41,299
to my forensic contacts just
to see if anyone knows anything.

175
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:42,934
Who found the body?

176
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:46,438
I thought he was just
sleeping it off for once.

177
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,939
I didn't realize he
was freakin' dead.

178
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:50,308
Do you know anyone who may have
had a problem with him?

179
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,343
No way.

180
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:52,711
We all loved Ricky.

181
00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:54,713
Did you notice anything strange
in the last few days?

182
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:56,314
Any unusual behavior?

183
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:57,582
Like what?

184
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,184
Like someone carrying
a small apothecary bottle

185
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:01,286
marked with a skull
and crossbones perhaps?

186
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:02,954
No, nothing like that.

187
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:05,524
But Johnny Kane came by
the dorm yesterday.

188
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:07,526
Mm.
What,<i> Johnny Kane </i>
Johnny Kane?

189
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:08,860
As in the actor Johnny Kane?

190
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:10,896
Yeah. My mom
went pretty nuts

191
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:12,464
when I told her.

192
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:14,032
He even signed
one of my DVDs.

193
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:15,300
No.
Huh.

194
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:18,203
Oh.<i> To Love Is to Die.</i>

195
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:19,604
(chuckles)
Impressive work.

196
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,473
I mean, to be a man
playing a woman playing a man.

197
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:23,875
It's absolutely dizzying.

198
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:25,710
What, should I have
said "spoiler"?

199
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:27,379
TIMMY:
Apparently he was here

200
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:28,613
researching a role.

201
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,015
Hmm, committed.

202
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:31,483
He's, like, 40 years old,
there's no way

203
00:07:31,485 --> 00:07:33,485
he could pull off
playing a college student.

204
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:35,520
Um, surely you
misspoke, Detective.

205
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:36,688
I mean, Johnny
Kane's a spry

206
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,423
and handsome young
man, wouldn't you say?

207
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:40,258
CHLOE: No, he's quite old.
And since when did you become

208
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,244
the president of his fan club?

209
00:07:42,245 --> 00:07:44,229
Since he just walked in here
wielding a large knife.

210
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:47,499
Am I too late?
Is he dead?

211
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:50,001
Is he dead?
Freeze. Drop
the knife.

212
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:51,870
It's my fault.
He's dead because of me.

213
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:52,871
Put down the
knife, Johnny.

214
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:54,072
Yes, listen to her, Johnny.

215
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:55,073
She's quite a good shot.

216
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:56,508
You don't understand!

217
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,043
I couldn't do
what the man said.

218
00:07:58,045 --> 00:08:00,162
What man?

219
00:08:00,163 --> 00:08:02,280
The man said
he would kill that kid

220
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:04,115
if I didn't cut my face.

221
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,719
♪ ♪

222
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:17,062
Mr. Johnny Kane,
you're an amazing actor

223
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:20,532
with an impressive library
of films under your belt.

224
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:22,767
Beloved by critics
and the public alike.

225
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:24,236
Many would say

226
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:27,672
you're at the top
of your profession right now.

227
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,241
Which is why
it'll be so interesting

228
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:32,677
to see what decision you make
for this experiment.

229
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,945
You can either...

230
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:38,984
carve up your own face, or...

231
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:42,521
Rick Cormier, an innocent
freshman at Malibu State,

232
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:44,689
will die of poisoning.

233
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,092
You have 24 hours to decide.

234
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:50,161
Do what's asked and an antidote
will be delivered.

235
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:53,565
The choice is yours alone.

236
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:54,833
LUCIFER:
Well, that's dramatic.

237
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:56,301
When did you get this video?

238
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:58,570
Yesterday. At first,

239
00:08:58,572 --> 00:09:00,972
I thought
it was some sick joke.

240
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:04,075
Fans send bizarre letters
to my manager all the time,

241
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:06,578
but this was sent directly
to my personal e-mail,

242
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,980
and it was so...

243
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:09,981
disturbing.

244
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:11,449
I couldn't get it
out of my head.

245
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:12,484
I had to
check it out.

246
00:09:12,486 --> 00:09:13,485
So you went to the school.

247
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:14,586
Yeah,
when I realized

248
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:16,555
that this kid was a real student
at Malibu,

249
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:18,256
I-- I started thinking

250
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:20,725
that this "experiment"
might be real, too.

251
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,795
I went home and I stared
at that knife for hours.

252
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:26,498
But I couldn't do it.

253
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,100
I couldn't cut up my face.

254
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:30,468
LUCIFER: Well,
of course you couldn't.

255
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,937
That's an impossible choice.

256
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:33,872
This killer is clearly
playing God.

257
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:35,574
I mean, no one would
do something like that

258
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:38,376
unless they're
being manipulated.

259
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:39,611
(sighs)

260
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:40,845
Not unlike someone

261
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:44,783
showing affection
when it made no logical sense.

262
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:46,618
(softly):
What?

263
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,886
JOHNNY: I mean,
what kind of sick bastard

264
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:49,120
would do such a thing?

265
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:51,623
That's exactly what
I'd like to know.

266
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:54,159
Excuse me.

267
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:56,861
(door opens)
Where are you going?

268
00:09:57,631 --> 00:09:58,930
(door closes)

269
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,199
Okay, look, we are
doing everything we can

270
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,435
to trace that e-mail,
but in the meantime,

271
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:06,004
did you have any connection
to the poisoned student?

272
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:07,839
Or any idea why
he was targeted?

273
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:10,241
No, until yesterday I'd never
met him before in my life.

274
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:16,948
(line ringing, phone ringing)

275
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:23,855
Like that, is it?

276
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,658
Excuse us, thank you.

277
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,793
Fess up.

278
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,328
What did you do to her?

279
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,596
I'm afraid you're gonna
have to be more specific.

280
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:33,465
I've done a lot of things
to a lot of people by now.

281
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:36,635
(chuckles) Don't play
silly buggers with me, Mum.

282
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:39,638
The detective kissed me
and I need to know why.

283
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,806
Did you say you kissed?

284
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,541
Please spare me
the appearance of surprise

285
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:44,943
and just tell me how you did it.

286
00:10:44,945 --> 00:10:46,711
Well, I wish I had that
kind of power, but, sadly,

287
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:48,380
I can't take credit.

288
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:52,984
Why are you so upset?

289
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:56,287
I assumed you'd be pleased
by such a development.

290
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,423
Well, I...

291
00:10:58,425 --> 00:11:02,293
I'm upset because
I just don't know if it's...

292
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:03,695
real.

293
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:05,697
All I can say is,

294
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:07,165
follow your heart, son.

295
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:11,302
These things have a way of
working themselves out in time.

Cyber got a hit

He works here part-time.

Dreary places, aren't they?

313
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,349
They smell like feet.

Detective, what has gotten
into you today?

319
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:14,099
This is usually when you
tell<i> me</i> to focus on the work.

320
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:17,035
And yes, of course
I've made out in a library.
Right.

00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:20,739
Yeah, I was-I was-- I've been

You know what?

323
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:24,709
Never mind.
(laughs)

324
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:26,911
It's definitely not getting
the reaction I was expecting.

325
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,379
Right.
So, just-- no.

326
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:30,065
You know what? No.

327
00:12:30,066 --> 00:12:31,750

What?
LAPD.

331
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:42,560
Show us what's in your hands.
No,

332
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:44,596
raise your hands above your head
where we can see them.

333
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:47,198
Well, it might be a gun,
Detective.
It's not a gun.

Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Look, I don't know
what you're talking about.

340
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,679
I don't know
any kid named Rick.

341
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:03,348
You are Dee-man69, yeah?

342
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,617
That's a very clever play
on words, by the way.

343
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,752
Was "Nevergetslaid#1" taken?

344

00:13:18,014 --> 00:13:19,731
Care to explain why you sent
Johnny Kane a threatening e-mail

348
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:20,932
yesterday at 9:10 a.m.?

349

Busted, Mr. Hoffing.

350
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:24,869
You may as well come clean now.
Pun intended.

351
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:27,205
First off, I'm kind of
a fan of Johnny Kane.

352
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:29,641
I think he's super talented,
but not enough to e-mail him.

353
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:30,842
And secondly,

354
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:32,110
I couldn't have e-mailed
him at that time

355
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:34,212
even if I wanted to.
I was T.A.ing a class.

356
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:37,015
Oh.
Here, I can prove it.

357
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:41,719
Okay.

358
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:42,821
There is an e-mail there.

359
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:44,255
Oh, wait for it.

360
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:45,190

361

Do they ever get
less predictable?

362
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:48,793
No, I'm serious.
It must've been hacked.

363
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:51,129
I didn't send that e-mail, and
I didn't send this one either.

364
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:53,965
What other one?
This one,
sent an hour ago.

365
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:56,034
It wasn't me.

366
00:13:57,871 --> 00:13:59,838
Dr. Gwendolyn Scott.

367
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,407
You're a world-renowned
thoracic surgeon.

368
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:05,476
Who's saved an awe-inspiring
number of lives.

369
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:08,279

so interesting to see

Ashley Corbett,

373

will be delivered.

to make that choice?

I have some upsetting
information to give to Lucifer.

514
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:45,783

00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:48,819

517
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:50,288

518
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:53,524
that Lucifer and I

519
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,326

he won't believe me.

ulterior motive.

Do you?

523
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:05,069
I'm not going to tell him
this information for you,

524

if that's what
you're asking.

525
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:10,942
What if I say
pretty please, hmm?

526
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:14,612
Apparently that's supposed
to do something.

527
00:20:14,614 --> 00:20:16,814
Look, I understand
that you have been--

528
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:21,219
uh, are the goddess
of all creation.

529
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:23,821
You're very...

530
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:25,957
uh, tall.

531
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:27,959

532
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:29,260

But my loyalties are
to my patient, your son.

534
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,866
Doctor-Devil
confidentiality.

535
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:38,369
But I'm not asking you
to break his trust.

536
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:40,871
In fact, I'm asking you
to illuminate the truth for him.

537
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:44,242
If he's going to make an
informed decision about Chlo...

538
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:48,212
...about his future here,

539
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:50,881
he needs to know the facts.

540
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:52,316
(softly):
Right?

541
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:54,585
I said please, right?

542
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:58,222
If this information
is as upsetting

543
00:20:58,224 --> 00:20:59,757
as you're making
it out to be,

544
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,826
I'm not interested
in being the messenger.

545
00:21:01,828 --> 00:21:03,828
Afraid I'm too
smart for that.

546
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:06,897
So what you're saying is I need
to find someone he'll trust

547
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:09,500
that is foolish enough
to help me deliver the news.

548
00:21:09,502 --> 00:21:12,903
That's the exact opposite
of what I'm suggesting.

549
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:13,904
Thank you, Doctor.

550
00:21:13,906 --> 00:21:17,241
I know just the person.

551
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:19,644
Now I see the resemblance.

552
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:25,283
All right, well, call me as soon
as you hear anything else.

553
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:26,317
Thanks.

554
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:27,318
How is she?

555
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,786
Is she going to be okay?

556
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:29,920
They found Ashley.

557
00:21:29,922 --> 00:21:31,856
She's in the hospital.

558
00:21:31,858 --> 00:21:34,325
But the poison must be different
from the first victim.

559
00:21:34,327 --> 00:21:38,863
The antidote they made,
it's... it's useless.

560
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:41,699
But don't worry,
we will figure out a way.

561
00:21:41,701 --> 00:21:42,933
We always do.

562
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:45,870
It just takes time. Okay?

563
00:21:45,872 --> 00:21:50,708
I, um... I need to get
a glass of water.

564
00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:55,413
(beeps)

565
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:56,814
This is Espinoza.

566
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:59,016
I need to get an update
on Ashley Corbett.

567
00:21:59,018 --> 00:22:00,217
(grinding, whirring)

568
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:02,887
I'm sorry. Can you say that
again? I can't hear you,

569
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:04,355
there's a...

570
00:22:04,357 --> 00:22:05,356
garbage disposal...

571
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:06,691
Doc!

572
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:09,026
Don't.

573
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:10,695
Don't.

574
00:22:15,368 --> 00:22:17,635
(screams)
DAN: No!

575
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:22,940
We e-mailed back
a photo of your hand.

576
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:24,508
Doubt we'll get a response.

577
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,210
The killer knows
that we may be monitoring.

578
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:28,746
That poor girl was going to die.

579
00:22:28,748 --> 00:22:29,680
I had no choice.

580
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:30,781
LUCIFER:
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

581
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:33,718
You had a choice not
to be so foolish.

582
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,785
Lucifer.

583
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:36,454
Well, who's to say
the killer wouldn't

584
00:22:36,456 --> 00:22:37,722
demand her other hand?

585
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:39,390
Her spleen?
Her heart?

586
00:22:39,392 --> 00:22:40,991
'Cause, believe me,
there is no winning

587
00:22:40,993 --> 00:22:43,728
when you play
by a twisted tyrant's rules.

588
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:46,230
Excuse me.
Can I talk to you for a second?

589
00:22:46,232 --> 00:22:48,666
(exhales)

590
00:22:48,668 --> 00:22:50,835
You are out of line.

591
00:22:50,837 --> 00:22:52,470
Me?

592
00:22:52,472 --> 00:22:54,638
The doctor just
destroyed her hand.

593
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,640
When are people going
to understand?

594
00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:59,243
Thou shalt not negotiate
with terrorists!

595
00:22:59,245 --> 00:23:00,344
Oh, surely
you can see

596
00:23:00,346 --> 00:23:01,912
this is a fool's game.

597
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:04,348
The only thing I can see is,
you are letting your emotions

598
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:08,018
get away from you. We can't let
our feelings get in the way

599
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,820
of our work,
Lucifer.

600
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:11,589
We have to work together
as a team,

601
00:23:11,591 --> 00:23:13,758
or else someone could get hurt.

602
00:23:14,761 --> 00:23:16,627
Yes.

603
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:19,530
Yes, I suppose they could.

604
00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:21,832
MESSENGER:
Hello?

605
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:25,569
I've got a delivery
for a Dr. Scott.

606
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:28,572
Uh, I'll take that. LAPD.

607
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,074
CHLOE:
Thanks.

608
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,448
"I'm a man of my word."

609
00:23:42,054 --> 00:23:43,587
The antidote.

610
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,923
We need to test this
and get it to Ashley now.

611
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:46,991
Right.

612
00:23:53,466 --> 00:23:54,999
Boo-yah.

613
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:56,767
Remember how I sent
a shout-out to my peeps

614
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:58,536
for other poison victims?
Mm-hmm.

615
00:23:58,538 --> 00:24:01,739
Well, meet Monsieur John Doe.

616
00:24:01,741 --> 00:24:04,208
Now, according
to my buddy at DHS,

617
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:06,977
this guy was found in the cargo
hold of a plane in Chicago.

618
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:09,580
Similar symptoms
to our poison vic.

619
00:24:09,582 --> 00:24:12,216
And get this,
the flight he was on?

620
00:24:12,218 --> 00:24:13,751
Came out of Los Angeles.

621
00:24:13,753 --> 00:24:15,753
So, he might actually be
the first victim?

622
00:24:15,755 --> 00:24:17,388
Mm-hmm. I mean,
the only difference

623
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:20,357
is he has hot spots all over
him, almost like the poison...

624
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:21,826
Spilled on him.

625
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:24,228
Exactly.

626
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,629
But this stuff is so strong,
Dan, that it killed him anyway.

627
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,732
I mean,
we are talking

628
00:24:28,734 --> 00:24:30,701
designer poison here.

629
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:34,038
Engineered
from controlled substances.

630
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,873
Each one
just a little bit different.

631
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:37,741
So, how do we get
an antidote?

632
00:24:37,743 --> 00:24:39,376
Well, that right there
is the tricky part.

633
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:42,379
Designer poisons
need designer antidotes.

634
00:24:42,381 --> 00:24:45,483
This guy, our killer,
is really good.

635
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:47,218
I mean, bad.

636
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,988
But really good.

637
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,256
Oh, my God.

638
00:24:52,258 --> 00:24:53,457
I know.

639
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:56,494
It's tough. But we'll get
through this, buddy.

640
00:24:56,496 --> 00:25:00,231
No. No, that photo.
Hold on one second.

641
00:25:00,233 --> 00:25:02,233
Where is it?

642
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:09,673
What?

643
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:12,409
The same
birthmark.

644
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:14,512
Your dead guy from Chicago

645
00:25:14,514 --> 00:25:15,646
is Andy Kleinberg.

646
00:25:15,648 --> 00:25:17,781
The rich guy that we
looked into for the murder

647
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:18,949
of that stewardess.

648
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:21,585
We were searching
for a... a special package

649
00:25:21,587 --> 00:25:23,287
that was smuggled
into the country,

650
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:25,155
Okay.
We never found it.

651
00:25:25,157 --> 00:25:26,223
It had to be the poison.

652
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:28,025
Kleinberg must've been
the one who stole it.

653
00:25:30,396 --> 00:25:32,763
And look what
happened to him.

654
00:25:34,834 --> 00:25:38,168
ASHLEY: This is the other
student that was poisoned?

655
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:40,137
I'm sorry.

656
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:41,672
I don't recognize him.

657
00:25:41,674 --> 00:25:44,308
It's okay. We just need
to ask you these questions

658
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,110
now that you're feeling better.

659
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:47,911
Yes. Now that your inside's
no longer bleeding out.

660
00:25:47,914 --> 00:25:49,046
CHLOE: Do you have
any idea, Ashley,

661
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,814
when you could've
been poisoned yesterday?

662
00:25:50,816 --> 00:25:53,551
No. I mean, it was a normal day.

663
00:25:53,553 --> 00:25:55,586
I woke up. I
had a bio exam.

664
00:25:55,588 --> 00:25:58,389
Lunch at the dorms...

665
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:00,658
Then I just, I went to the
gym, I couldn't even work out

666
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,459
'cause my arm was kind of sore.

667
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:04,295
Why was your arm sore?

668
00:26:04,297 --> 00:26:05,863
ASHLEY:
I don't know.

669
00:26:05,865 --> 00:26:08,966
Uh, I guess, 'cause of
the flu shot that I got?

670
00:26:08,968 --> 00:26:10,734
Do you think that
could have been it?

671
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,136
CHLOE: So, according
to the M.E. report,

672
00:26:12,138 --> 00:26:14,471
the other kid got
a flu shot, too.

673
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:16,140
Ah. Well, what do you know?

674
00:26:16,142 --> 00:26:17,808
Ashley, where did
you get the shot?

675
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:19,843
The university health van.

676
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:20,844
Great. Thank you.

677
00:26:20,846 --> 00:26:22,713
Yes.
(clears throat)

678
00:26:22,715 --> 00:26:25,349
Excuse me.
Get well soon.

679
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:26,250
(beeps)

680
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:28,185
DAN:
The guy who gave the flu shots

681
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:29,153
was Dr. Jason Carlisle.

682
00:26:29,155 --> 00:26:31,855
This is footage
of a car accident he was in.

683
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:37,461
He was a professor at Malibu
until this video went viral.

684
00:26:37,463 --> 00:26:39,330
No!

685
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:41,999
Want to know why?

686
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:44,034
Because the poor sap
saved himself?

687
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:46,170
Correction. Because he saved
the dissertation he'd been

688
00:26:46,172 --> 00:26:48,606
working on for four years, while
an innocent college student

689
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:50,174
working as an Uber driver died.

690
00:26:50,176 --> 00:26:51,909
He was publicly humiliated,
his wife left him,

691
00:26:51,911 --> 00:26:55,479
he lost his job, his entire
world spiraled out of control.

692
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:57,147
So he took a job
as a mobile health tech.

693
00:26:57,149 --> 00:26:59,650
I thought our killer
was just raving mad,

694
00:26:59,652 --> 00:27:01,185
but he's trying
to prove a bloody point.

695
00:27:01,187 --> 00:27:03,921
That everyone would make
the same choice he did.

696
00:27:03,923 --> 00:27:06,290
Saving their livelihood
over someone else's life.

697
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,658
Johnny Kane's face
is his bread and butter,

698
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,126
and so is the surgeon's hand.

699
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:11,061
So he's recreating
his own moral dilemma.

700
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:12,730
He's picking everyone
by design--

701
00:27:12,732 --> 00:27:13,731
the kids, the professionals...

702
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:14,932
And he's not done.

703
00:27:14,934 --> 00:27:16,367
Unis searched
the professor's house.

704
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:19,436
They found files on over
a dozen possible targets.

705
00:27:19,438 --> 00:27:21,672
Okay. Well, we need to find him
or else we need to figure out

706
00:27:21,674 --> 00:27:24,475
a way to draw him out carefully.

707
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:25,843
Or we could
just get a big stick

708
00:27:25,845 --> 00:27:27,811
and poke the bear
as hard as we can.

709
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:29,079
What does that mean?

710
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:31,081
LUCIFER: Well, this man
clearly has an oversized ego,

711
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:34,018
comparing himself to the likes
of Johnny Kane and Dr. Scott.

712
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:37,154
If we threaten that ego,
trust me, he'll respond.

713
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:37,955
How do you know?

714
00:27:37,957 --> 00:27:39,690
Because I know his type, Daniel.

715
00:27:39,692 --> 00:27:41,558
Used to live with him, in fact.

716
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,260
Called him Dad.

717
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,933
What are you doing?

718
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:51,702
(typing)

719
00:27:51,704 --> 00:27:53,303
What are you doing, Detective?

720
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:54,705
Sending him an e-mail.

721
00:27:54,707 --> 00:27:56,407
(laughs)
What?

722
00:27:56,409 --> 00:27:58,108
LUCIFER:
"You pathetic sad sack,

723
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:00,210
"no wonder
you didn't get tenure,

724
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:02,246
your experiments
are as ugly as you are."

725
00:28:02,248 --> 00:28:03,681
Well said, Detective.

726
00:28:03,683 --> 00:28:05,716
DAN: Seriously? Insulting
the serial killer?

727
00:28:05,718 --> 00:28:07,184
That's an awesome idea.

728
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:07,985
Thank you.

729
00:28:07,987 --> 00:28:09,853
Also, his mask is a bit lame.

730
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:11,955
Could be much creepier.
Put that in.

731
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,993
DAN: Chloe. Don't send this.
All right? It's not you.

732
00:28:15,995 --> 00:28:17,861
This is... This is,
it's a rash move.

733
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,963
(continues typing)

734
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,732
(taps key)

735
00:28:21,734 --> 00:28:23,233
DAN:
That's great.

736
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:24,968
I mean, what could
go wrong, right?

737
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:27,071
I mean, surely this won't
force the psycho underground,

738
00:28:27,073 --> 00:28:28,739
it won't cause him to
do anything crazy...

739
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:29,873
Chill out, Dan.

740
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,041
(computer chimes)

741
00:28:32,344 --> 00:28:33,877
He responded.

742
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:35,245
Ah, told you.

743
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:38,782
With a link.

744
00:28:40,486 --> 00:28:42,119
Hello, Detective.

745
00:28:42,121 --> 00:28:45,856
You don't need that mask
anymore, Professor Carlisle.

746
00:28:45,858 --> 00:28:47,191
(exhales sharply)

747
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,629
(inhales, exhales)

748
00:28:52,631 --> 00:28:54,198
Ah.

749
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,234
So much easier to breathe
without that thing.

750
00:28:58,504 --> 00:29:00,304
What do you want, Professor?

751
00:29:00,306 --> 00:29:04,374
What do I want? To finish my
experiment without interference,

752
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:05,843
but here we are...

753
00:29:05,845 --> 00:29:07,344
LUCIFER: Your experiment
failed, Professor.

754
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:09,113
We proved your theory wrong.

755
00:29:09,115 --> 00:29:11,181
The doctor chose to save
the girl. So, clearly,

756
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:13,550
not everyone's as egregiously
selfish as you are.

757
00:29:13,552 --> 00:29:17,187
I am not a selfish person.
I was vilified for doing

758
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:20,524
what anyone
in my position would do.

759
00:29:20,526 --> 00:29:22,693
You went back for your computer.
That's not about survival,

760
00:29:22,695 --> 00:29:24,061
that's about stuff.

761
00:29:24,063 --> 00:29:27,064
It was about instinct,
but thank you

762
00:29:27,066 --> 00:29:29,633
for reminding me
why I'm doing this

763
00:29:29,635 --> 00:29:31,568
and for helping me

764
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:34,671
to improve upon my experiment.

765
00:29:34,673 --> 00:29:36,340
Truth is, Dr. Scott

766
00:29:36,342 --> 00:29:39,643
only mutilated her hand
because she was being observed

767
00:29:39,645 --> 00:29:41,145
by you.

768
00:29:41,147 --> 00:29:44,481
So this time
I'm controlling my variables.

769
00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:49,753
Meet...

770
00:29:49,755 --> 00:29:52,222
Benjamin Tibi.

771
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:55,392
Innocent student,
attached to a poison drip.

772
00:29:55,394 --> 00:29:57,761
And here, Leon Klem,

773
00:29:57,763 --> 00:30:01,064
accomplished track star,
stuck in a vice.

774
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:03,901
If Leon simply pulls the lever

775
00:30:03,903 --> 00:30:07,771
and severs his leg
within 60 minutes,

776
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:08,972
Benji here

777
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:11,675
gets... this.

778
00:30:11,677 --> 00:30:13,977
You guessed it.

779
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:15,846
The antidote.

780
00:30:15,848 --> 00:30:18,982
Oh, and please, for your sake...

781
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:22,452
...don't waste your time
trying to make another.

782
00:30:22,454 --> 00:30:24,521
They're all unique,

783
00:30:24,523 --> 00:30:27,424
and the only place
the formula lives

784
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:28,926
is right here,

785
00:30:28,928 --> 00:30:31,094
in my head.

786
00:30:32,731 --> 00:30:34,631
Not bad for a sad sack

787
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:37,000
who couldn't get tenure, huh?

788
00:30:37,837 --> 00:30:39,403
CHLOE:
Professor, wait!

789
00:30:41,207 --> 00:30:43,407
Well.

790
00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:45,542

It's simple. There's something
Lucifer needs to know.

794
00:31:06,765 --> 00:31:08,031
I think you should tell him.

Oh, really? And why's that?

his beloved Chloe.

Granny Panties Decker?
A miracle?

817
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:53,610
Please.

818
00:31:54,647 --> 00:31:56,046
35 years ago,

819
00:31:56,048 --> 00:31:58,615
Amenadiel was sent to this bar,
where he sat down,

820
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:01,118
had a chat, then blessed
Penelope Decker

821
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,754
so that she and her husband
could have a child.

822
00:32:03,756 --> 00:32:05,088
That child

823
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,623
is Lucifer's partner.

824
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:08,759
It's no accident that they met.

825
00:32:08,761 --> 00:32:12,930
Mm. So, what, Amenadiel blessed
Penelope's lady parts?

826
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:14,965
Wait,
is Amenadiel

827
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:16,800
Chloe Decker's daddy?

828
00:32:16,802 --> 00:32:19,636
(laughs)
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

829
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:22,439
Think...

830
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:24,508
about it.

831
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:27,177
Haven't you ever wondered
why that particular human

832
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:29,246
makes him vulnerable?

833
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:31,381
Mm.

834
00:32:31,383 --> 00:32:33,317
But if you still
don't believe me,

835
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:35,619
there's something
you should see.

836
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,126
No luck.
I called every lab

837
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:44,594
the professor's ever
been affiliated with--

838
00:32:44,596 --> 00:32:46,029
no one's seen him.

839
00:32:46,031 --> 00:32:47,397
He could have built
that lab anywhere,

840
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:49,733
and the video link
was untraceable.

841
00:32:49,735 --> 00:32:51,201
What if I made a mistake?

842
00:32:51,203 --> 00:32:52,369
What if by sending
that e-mail

843
00:32:52,371 --> 00:32:54,271
I just sped up
his timeline?

844
00:32:54,273 --> 00:32:55,472
There's two lives
on the line here.

845
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:56,473
Two lives that you're
going to save,

846
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,342
Detective, I know you will.
Exactly.

847
00:32:58,344 --> 00:33:02,212
Found something.
Please tell me it's good news.

848
00:33:02,214 --> 00:33:04,548
Eh, more like medium news.

849
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:07,351
So, Kleinberg's autopsy
came back.

850
00:33:07,353 --> 00:33:08,485
Turns out he didn't die
of poisoning.

851
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:09,920
I mean, he would have
died of poisoning,

852
00:33:09,922 --> 00:33:11,722
except he was
strangled.

853
00:33:11,724 --> 00:33:12,990
Impatient
little killer.

854
00:33:12,992 --> 00:33:14,891
Since I finally got
time of death right,

855
00:33:14,893 --> 00:33:16,159
I was able to ping

856
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:17,894
Kleinberg's cell
to Van Nuys Airport,

857
00:33:17,896 --> 00:33:20,564
where I got this.

858
00:33:20,566 --> 00:33:22,833
CHLOE:
It's the professor,
clear as day.

859
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:25,435
So we can assume
that he killed Kleinberg.
ELLA: Right.

860
00:33:25,437 --> 00:33:27,704
But this only tells us
where the professor was.

861
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:28,638
It doesn't tell us

862
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,141
where he actually is,
hence "medium" news.

863
00:33:31,143 --> 00:33:33,276
Uh, can you rewind it
to the part

864
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:35,312
where he goes through security?

865
00:33:35,314 --> 00:33:37,514
Why, what are you
looking for?

866
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:39,750
CHLOE:
Okay, freeze there.

867
00:33:39,752 --> 00:33:41,418
And then zoom in on the tray.

868
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,987
Looks like a key card
with a logo.

869
00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:45,055
ELLA:
Oh, definitely a bird.

870
00:33:45,057 --> 00:33:47,157
School mascot maybe?

871
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:48,692
We checked every lab
at Malibu State.

872
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:50,460
LUCIFER:
Well, he wouldn't go
back there, would he?

873
00:33:50,462 --> 00:33:52,729
Trust me, when you get kicked
out of a fancy party,

874
00:33:52,731 --> 00:33:54,631
the last thing you want
to do is sneak back in.

875
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:57,234
You do the opposite.

876
00:33:57,236 --> 00:33:59,069
Who's Malibu's closest rival?

877
00:34:01,006 --> 00:34:02,906
CHLOE:<i> The lab in here</i>
<i> is closed for renovation,</i>

878
00:34:02,908 --> 00:34:05,242
<i> so maybe he's here.</i>

879
00:34:16,488 --> 00:34:20,557
Well, well, isn't
this a surprise.

880
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:21,691
(door rattles)

881
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:23,760
It's locked, Detective.

882
00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:27,164
But with that said, I'm
actually glad you made it.

883
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:29,199
Why, because you'd
like to surrender?

884
00:34:29,201 --> 00:34:31,968
It's a bit anticlimactic,
but very well, we accept.

885
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:36,440
No, because now
you get to see firsthand

886
00:34:36,442 --> 00:34:38,508
what I'm trying to prove.

887
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,377
CHLOE:
It's over, Professor.

888
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:43,980
Afraid you're
wrong about that.

889
00:34:43,982 --> 00:34:46,283
(gunshot)

890
00:34:46,285 --> 00:34:47,918
Acrylic glass, Detective.

891
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,987
Please don't kill yourself
with your own bullet.

892
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:52,322
We wouldn't be able
to conduct

893
00:34:52,324 --> 00:34:54,391
the final part
of this experiment.

894
00:34:54,393 --> 00:34:56,927
Time for you
to make a choice.

895
00:34:56,929 --> 00:35:02,099
In this vial, an antidote
that will save Benji's life.

896
00:35:02,101 --> 00:35:04,367
In vial<i> numero dos,</i>

897
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:06,970
poisonous gas
that will kill you

898
00:35:06,972 --> 00:35:08,271
if you enter the room.

899
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:10,874
Simple, really--
you decide

900
00:35:10,876 --> 00:35:13,110
what's more important.

901
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:19,316
No.

902
00:35:34,233 --> 00:35:37,033
W-W-W-What are you doing?
If I don't get
in that room right now,

903
00:35:37,035 --> 00:35:38,401
that kid is gonna die.

904
00:35:38,403 --> 00:35:39,636
Word of advice, Detective.

905
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,905
If you go into that room
right now,<i> you'll</i> die.

906
00:35:41,907 --> 00:35:43,206
What are we supposed to do?

907
00:35:45,177 --> 00:35:46,810
I can save him.
What?

908
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:48,912
But in order to do so, you need
to go after the professor

909
00:35:48,914 --> 00:35:50,313
right now,
before it's too late.

910
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:51,581
What?
I promise you

911
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:53,650
I can get to that antidote
without harming myself.

912
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:55,919
How?
We don't have time
to explain.

913
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:57,921
Do you trust me?

914
00:35:57,923 --> 00:36:00,624
Yes.
Then go.

915
00:36:02,027 --> 00:36:03,693
Go!

916
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:17,474
Freeze!

917
00:36:19,478 --> 00:36:20,644
(grunts)
(screams)

918
00:36:20,646 --> 00:36:22,212
Right.

919
00:36:22,214 --> 00:36:23,513
(coughs)

920
00:36:29,655 --> 00:36:31,221
Okay.

921
00:36:31,657 --> 00:36:34,224
Oh!

922
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:39,796
(grunts)
(indistinct chatter)

923
00:36:39,798 --> 00:36:41,531
(both grunt)

924
00:36:44,203 --> 00:36:45,468
(yells)

925
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:53,443
Oh, come on, Detective,
a bit of help here!

926
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:55,579
I need you further away.

927
00:37:02,187 --> 00:37:03,253
Freeze!

928
00:37:03,255 --> 00:37:06,690
There's nowhere left
to run, Professor.

929
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:14,664
(laughs cynically)

930
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,841
(inhales deeply)

931
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:26,843
(exhales)

932
00:37:28,547 --> 00:37:29,879
Lovely.

933
00:37:37,155 --> 00:37:38,688
I knew you'd save yourself.

934
00:37:40,525 --> 00:37:42,892
It was the only choice
you could make.

935
00:37:42,894 --> 00:37:44,894
Put down the knife.

936
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:46,763
It's not too late.

937
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:48,832
You can still make
a different choice.

938
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:51,768
The right choice.

939
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,903
You can still save
that kid back there.

940
00:37:53,905 --> 00:37:57,574
You still don't get it.

941
00:37:57,576 --> 00:37:59,376
I didn't want anyone
to get hurt,

942
00:37:59,378 --> 00:38:02,445
but I needed people
to understand

943
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:07,450
I'm not a monster,
I'm human.

944
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:10,320
You call it biology,
call it God,

945
00:38:10,322 --> 00:38:14,024
but choice is an illusion.

946
00:38:14,026 --> 00:38:15,692
I didn't have one

947
00:38:15,694 --> 00:38:19,663
when I pulled myself
out of that burning car.

948
00:38:19,665 --> 00:38:23,533
And I certainly
don't have one now.

949
00:38:25,037 --> 00:38:27,904
You'll understand soon enough.

950
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,189
Where is he?

951
00:38:46,191 --> 00:38:48,658
Where is Lucifer?

952
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,327
I'm right here,
Detective.

953
00:38:51,863 --> 00:38:55,098
See? I told you everything
would be all right.

954
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:02,205
I'm so glad you're okay.

955
00:39:02,207 --> 00:39:04,607
(chuckles)

956
00:39:05,644 --> 00:39:08,144
Hey.

957
00:39:08,146 --> 00:39:11,348
I guess we make a good team
after all, don't we?

958
00:39:14,586 --> 00:39:17,821
This is real, isn't it?

959
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:26,396

962
00:39:37,142 --> 00:39:40,143
If he said he'll be here,
he'll be here.

Mazikeen!

964
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,481
Interesting choice of venue.

965
00:39:48,286 --> 00:39:49,519
My, my,

966
00:39:49,521 --> 00:39:50,954
how the tide has turned.

967
00:39:50,956 --> 00:39:53,823
What's this, celestial
enemies' night out?

968
00:39:53,825 --> 00:39:55,291
Why don't you have
a seat, Lucifer.

969
00:39:55,293 --> 00:39:58,061
There's something that
we need to tell you.

970
00:39:58,063 --> 00:40:02,165
Ooh, some sort of supernatural
intervention, is it?

971
00:40:02,167 --> 00:40:03,383
(chuckles)

972
00:40:03,384 --> 00:40:04,600
Well, doesn't matter
what shenanigans

973
00:40:04,603 --> 00:40:05,668
you two have got
cooking up,

974
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,470
'cause, quite frankly,
I'm too happy

975
00:40:07,472 --> 00:40:08,972
for you to spoil things.

976
00:40:08,974 --> 00:40:10,507
Happy?
Yeah.

977
00:40:10,509 --> 00:40:13,710
The detective and I...
Sorry...

978
00:40:13,712 --> 00:40:16,379
<i> Chloe</i> and I are real.

979
00:40:16,381 --> 00:40:18,882
I mean, I didn't think
it could happen,

980
00:40:18,884 --> 00:40:22,685
but it has, and I've got
this overwhelming sensation--

981
00:40:22,687 --> 00:40:25,288
I can't even
describe it, but...

982
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:27,724
I feel invincible.

983
00:40:27,726 --> 00:40:30,093
So come on, ladies,
bring it on.

984
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:33,730
Whatever it is, I'm sure
I can deal with it.

985
00:40:36,001 --> 00:40:38,301
Forget it.
Come on.

986
00:40:38,303 --> 00:40:39,302
What?

987
00:40:39,304 --> 00:40:40,937
There's nothing to talk about.

988
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:43,306
What? I've only
just got here.
Go. Go.

989
00:40:43,308 --> 00:40:45,008
We discussed this,
Mazikeen.

990
00:40:46,478 --> 00:40:48,578
No.<i> You</i> discussed this.

991
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:51,347
And I don't want to have
anything to do with it anymore.

992
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:52,749
I thought you understood.

993
00:40:52,751 --> 00:40:55,351
We're doing this for<i> him.</i>

994
00:40:55,353 --> 00:40:57,020

Is that it?

995
00:40:57,022 --> 00:41:00,590
Or are you trying
to get back at your ex?

996
00:41:00,592 --> 00:41:02,091
MOM: You don't know
what you're talking about.

997
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:03,626
I knew

998
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:06,729
you were up to something.
What the hell is this?

999
00:41:06,731 --> 00:41:10,099
What's Amenadiel doing
with Chloe's mum?

1000
00:41:13,405 --> 00:41:14,771
I think you already know.

1001
00:41:14,773 --> 00:41:18,174
Don't toy with me, Mother.

1002
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:20,210
What is this?

1003
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:22,245
I've been trying to find
the right way to tell you.

1004
00:41:26,518 --> 00:41:29,519
But there is no right way,
because the truth...

1005
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:36,226
...is... this is
your Father's doing.

Chloe...

1007
00:41:37,863 --> 00:41:40,663
is His doing-- He put her
