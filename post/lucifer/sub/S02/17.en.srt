What does Maze think

Well, I don't know;
I haven't told her.

10
00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:20,486

I'm busy keeping an eye

29
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,374
No, it's important.
I think you might be in danger.

Tuesday already?

Anger is Maze's

No, this is
different, Luci.

39
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:35,661
I think you really need
to talk to her.

40
00:01:35,663 --> 00:01:37,362
She'll get over it;
she always does.

41
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:39,364
Right now, we have bigger
issues to deal with,

42
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:42,501

Mum is wasting our time.

44
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:48,407
has found another piece
of the Flaming Sword, so do I.

45
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:51,610
Oh, such a loyal son.

46
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,479
But Mum hasn't
adapted to this world

47
00:01:53,481 --> 00:01:55,514
as well as you
might think.

48
00:01:55,516 --> 00:01:58,350
This chap could be conning her.

49
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:00,119
I think I'm gonna
go make sure...

50
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:03,188
She seems
to be doing just fine.

51
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:06,959
That's not the money, is it?

52
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:09,461
Of course not. She wouldn't
bring it to the meeting.

53
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:12,264
Oh, no. Of course not.

54
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:13,632
I mean, that would be
absurd, wouldn't it?

55
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,667
She's just showing it to him.
I mean, it's not like

56
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:17,769
she's gonna hand it to him
before she...

57
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:18,871
gets the piece.

58
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:20,506
That's great.

59
00:02:20,508 --> 00:02:24,309
And now she's letting
him leave. Marvelous.

60
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:29,882
Well, that went well.

61
00:02:29,884 --> 00:02:30,883
LUCIFER:
Oh, you think so,

62
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:33,219
do you?
I do.

63
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,554
He has what we need in his safe
in the back room.

64
00:02:35,556 --> 00:02:36,388
Oh.

65
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,789
He's going to get it right now.

66
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:40,425
Mum, you just handed him
a briefcase full of cash

67
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:42,427
with no proof whatsoever
he has what we need.

68
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:44,696
And?
You've been conned.

69
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:47,032
(scoffs) He's a client
of mine, darling.

70
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:48,133
I don't think

71
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:50,235
he'd be that foolhardy.
Oh.

72
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:55,274
Well, I'm sure
he'll be right back.

73
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:59,411
Maybe we should go check
just to be sure.

74
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:01,380
I think that's a good idea,
don't you?

75
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:03,649
Oh.

76
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:10,789
Huh. See?
He didn't con me.

77
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:13,492
Look, instead he's dead,
and someone robbed him

78
00:03:13,494 --> 00:03:15,727
of what's ours--
much better.

79
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:19,398
Well, the good news is,
after this spectacular bungling,

80
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,067
I happen to work with
a homicide detective.

81
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:23,636
If you find the killer,

82
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:25,204
then you'll find our piece
of the Flaming Sword.

83
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:26,405
Hey, but, Mom...

84
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:27,973
The challenge is making sure
we catch the case

85
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:29,491
before some other detective.

86
00:03:29,492 --> 00:03:31,008
But what about...
I may be able to help.

87
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:33,679
Really?
I'm all ears.

88
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:35,681
(door closes)

89
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,224
Is everything all right here?

90
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:46,692
Yeah, everything's fine, Maze.

91
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:49,828
You can, uh, you-you can
put away the knives.

92
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:54,633
We'll be in touch,
Dr. Martin.

93
00:03:57,805 --> 00:03:59,838
Excuse me.

94
00:04:00,975 --> 00:04:03,709
Uh, Maze.

95
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:05,944
Maze.

96
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:07,479
Oh, my Lord.

97
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:10,649
Who the hell was that?

98
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:15,053
<i> That</i> was the chairman
of the ethics review board.

99
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:16,054
Are you okay?

100
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:18,023
No.

101
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:20,659
No, I am not.

102
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:22,261
No, Maze. No, no,
no, don't, don't.

103
00:04:22,263 --> 00:04:23,762
That won't do any good.

104
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,230
What happened?

105
00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:26,498
A couple of weeks ago,

106
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,533
I maybe, sort of...

107
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:31,870
helped Lucifer break out
of a mental institution.

108
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:34,172
Using my own name.

109
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:36,074
It's my fault, really.

110
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:38,610
No, it is not your fault.
It is Lucifer's fault.

111
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,579
It's always
Lucifer's fault.

112
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:43,282
First, I find out he's
ditching me to go to Heaven,

113
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:45,317
and now he's hurting you.

114
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:48,120
Look, I'm gonna fix this, Linda.

115
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:51,590

If you'll excuse me.

Hear me out.

136
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,274
A client of
mine called.

137
00:05:42,276 --> 00:05:43,909

00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:46,144

139
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:47,412
Oh, that's awful.

140
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:48,747
Detective, we should
do something.

141
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:50,182
He's at a bar downtown.

142
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:53,085
Would you come with me
and make sure that he's okay?

143
00:05:53,087 --> 00:05:54,386
Nope.

144
00:05:54,388 --> 00:05:56,021
Nope?

145
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,240
I'm a homicide cop.

146
00:05:58,241 --> 00:06:00,458
I do not go around
checking on worried criminals

147
00:06:00,461 --> 00:06:02,594

148
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:05,597
So if we're done here.
I heard... things.

149
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,000
On a...

150
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:11,269
On-on the phone call.

151
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:12,471
Like?

152
00:06:14,308 --> 00:06:18,009
Fingers... pointing.

153
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:19,211
You heard

154
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:21,480
fingers pointing?

155
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:23,782
Very angrily.

156
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:24,850
Yes.

157
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:29,121
Also, a gunshot.

158
00:06:29,123 --> 00:06:31,056
Sounded like he was...

159
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:33,725
dying, or, um...

160
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,127
melting?

161
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:38,563
It's hard to tell.

162
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:39,664
Charlotte...

163
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,233
It sounds worth our time,
actually.

164
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:42,601
Agreed.

165
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:44,870
Why didn't you just
lead with that?

166
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:53,011
The lock's damaged.

167
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:54,179
LUCIFER:
Is it?

168
00:06:57,384 --> 00:06:59,418
CHLOE:
Looks like you're right.

169
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,486
He's been dead
about an hour.

170
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:03,588
Oh? Impressive guess,
Detective.

171
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:08,927
Uh, I'm assuming
from the... discoloration.

172
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,329
Well, that wasn't
a complete Dumpster fire,

173
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:13,732
but now that we're finished,
you can see yourself out.

174
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:15,801
I'll do nothing of the sort.

175
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:18,170
Fine. I'll show you out,
if you insist.

176
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:19,971
I'm not going anywhere.

177
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:23,341
But the detective and I have
got everything handled now.

178
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:26,211
This is far too important
to leave to just the two of you.

179
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:27,479
I will stick around.

180
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:28,447
Mum.

181
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:29,481
Besides,

182
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:31,583
we'll get to work together.

183
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:33,118
Won't that be fun?

184
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:37,689
♪ ♪

185
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:46,364
ELLA: We're running tests for
gunshot residue and cocaine.

186
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:47,799
Should have those
in, like, five minutes.

187
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,334
Okay. Good.

188
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:51,336
(siren wailing in distance)

189
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:53,004
Oh, Charlotte.

190
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:54,673
You're still here, huh?
Well, he was my client.

191
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:57,442
I thought I might be
of help to the case.

192
00:07:57,444 --> 00:07:59,578
But if not, we could always
get her to shoo along

193
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,246
and we can carry on
with our business.

194
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:02,314
No. I'm sure she could be
very helpful.

195
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,483
So tell me,
why does Zeke Moore,

196
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:06,351
a manager at
an import/export company,

197
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:07,719
have you representing him?

198
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:09,888
Because I'm the best.
At getting criminals off.

199
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,223
Well, that's not true.

200
00:08:11,225 --> 00:08:13,258
I haven't slept with
any of my clients.

201
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,259
What?

202
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:15,360
(sighs)
You represent

203
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:16,428
the worst of the worst.

204
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,629
So why was Zeke a client?

205
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:20,165
Because he works
for Bianca Ruiz.

206
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,333
What? The tequila magnate?

207
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:23,068
Bianca's tequila empire
is a front.

208
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:26,338
She uses the distribution routes
to sell guns, drugs,

209
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,473
and, oh, yeah, people.

210
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:31,176
So we've been after her
for a long time.

211
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:32,577
Who do you think did this?

212
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:34,579
A rival of some sort?

213
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:36,448
CHLOE: Well, that's actually
a good question.

214
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,283
Ella, what do we have?

215
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:39,618
ELLA:
Well, no smoking gun,

216
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,320
but poor Zeke here
got shot twice.

217
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:43,622
First in the thigh--

218
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:46,391
bullet winged him--
and then another

219
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:50,328
went through his hand
hitting him in the chest.

220
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,464
Probably trying
to defend himself.

221
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:54,366
Too bad you can't catch bullets.

222
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:55,567
Well, he can't maybe.

223
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:57,435
I don't think this was
a professional hit.

224
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:59,037
Maybe a robbery gone wrong.

225
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,473
And idea of
what was taken?

226
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:03,675
ELLA: Well, trace elements
point to cash,

227
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:07,112
cocaine, gunpowder residue,
indicating weapons--

228
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:09,581
all your basic bad guy stuff.

229
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,182
No sign of forced entry, though.

230
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:13,118
CHLOE: Which means the killer
either knew the combination,

231
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,954
or he just waited for the vic
to open it to strike.

232
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:16,955
ELLA:
Mm-hmm.

233
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:20,792
Hey, I got something here.

234
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:23,828
Cell phone.

235
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,332
No dust on it,
so it hasn't been there long.

236
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:28,900
Well, Zeke had his phone on him,

237
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,602
so this one could be
the killer's.

238
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:32,604
Maybe he dropped it
during the fight

239
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:35,240
or just didn't have time
to retrieve it.

240
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:36,775
Passcode protected,

241
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:38,443
of course.

242
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:41,947
But the home screen is...
two eyes?

243
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:43,682
Human female breasts.

244
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,416
No. That is a woman's
perfectly freckled rump.

245
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,719
CHLOE: So our lead
on the killer

246
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:51,957
is a pair of butt-boob-eyes.

247
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:53,959

Ms. Ruiz there is my client.

I'm not having

LUCIFER:

to publish this music
of their own free will?

279
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,474
It's a vanity label.
It exists only to make

this one guy's music.
CHLOE: Okay, well,

281

who owns it?

Chet Ruiz.

Bianca's youngest son.

285
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:27,085
Half our billing
goes to keeping him out of jail.

286
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:29,154
CHLOE:
So Bianca's own son

287
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:32,290
robbed and killed
one of her most loyal soldiers?

288
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:34,859
The files barely mention Chet.
I didn't know he was actually

289
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,795
part of the family business.
MOM: He's not.

290
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:39,597
Bianca tries to keep him as far
away from it all as possible.

291
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:42,033
Maybe he started to resent that,
decided to make a play?

292
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,102
And then dropped his phone,
proving just how right

293
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:45,603
his mother was
about him. (chuckles)

294
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:47,238
CHLOE:
Well, if Chet is the killer,

295
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,908
this could be our chance to
take down Bianca, as well.

296
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,643
Cut off the head
of her entire operation.

297
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:52,977
This could be huge.

298
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:56,047
Yeah. Bummer is the phone proves
that Chet was in the room

299
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,917
but doesn't definitively
tie him to the murder.

300
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:01,252
Dan, why don't you work
on hacking the passcode.

301
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:02,620
I'll have a chat with Chet.

302
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:04,889
And, Charlotte, thank you
so much for your help.

303
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,624
But now that
one of your clients

304
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:08,626
is our main suspect,
it's best you go.

305
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:10,395
I don't think
I have to go quite yet.

306
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,430
Maybe not,
but I think you should.

307
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:14,199
Bianca's having a party today.

308
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:15,700
It's the launch

309
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:16,835
of her new tequila.

310
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:19,370
I'm sure
Chet will be there, and...

311
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:20,872
I'm invited.

312
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:22,073
Why do you want to help us now?

313
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,541
Because we all want
the same thing:

314
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:25,510
to find out
who robbed and killed Zeke.

315
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:27,345
DAN: You know, Chloe,
it would be

316
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:28,913
a good chance for us
to go undercover.

317
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,182
Gather some intel before they
even know we're onto them.

318
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:32,951
(clears throat) All right.

319
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:34,285
Fine. Good. It's settled.

320
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:37,122
The detective and I will go, so
thank you so much for your help.

321
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:38,423
I don't think so.

322
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,525
The invitation
is under my name.

323
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:42,026
I will go.

324
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:45,930
Perhaps Detective Espinoza
should join me.

325
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,766
No. Yes, that's not happening.

326
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:49,134
Uh, very well.
I'll go with you...

327
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:51,202
No, I'll go with Charlotte.
But, Detective...

328
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:52,170
No more argument.

329
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:54,405
Very well.
But I suggest you go shopping.

330
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:57,175
This isn't the kind of place
you can attend in pajamas.

331
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,546
This is ridiculous.

332
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:03,782
Pajamas?

333
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:05,550
What if Ella goes to the party?

334
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:06,985
That sounds like a great idea.

335
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:09,554
Oh, my God. Thank you so much
for thinking of me.

336
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:11,523
But you know what? I'm so busy.

337
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:13,158
I have been sidelined

338
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,727
by my own mother
and the detective.

339
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:17,195
(chuckles):
It's absurd.

340
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:18,163
I won't stand for it.

341
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:20,598
I am gonna find a way
into that party.

342
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,967
MAZE: Do you always
whine like this?

343
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,770
I don't know
how she puts up with it.

344
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:27,939
Where's Dr. Linda?

345
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:29,240
Suspended.

346
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:30,675
Because of you.

347
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:33,111
Because you have
been a terrible,

348
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:35,847
selfish friend.

349
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:37,782
To her.

350
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:39,384
Now you're gonna fix it.

351
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:42,453
Well, gladly, once I figure
a way back onto the case.

352
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:45,490
No, Lucifer.

353
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,158
Now!

354
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,794
But I suppose they can
handle things without me

355
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:52,096
for the time being. (chuckles)

356
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:53,298
What's the plan?

357
00:13:57,437 --> 00:14:01,206
It'll take two hours
to scan the phone.

358
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,874
I'll come to you.

359
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:05,476
I'll kill some time
till it's done.

360
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:07,679
See you soon.

361
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:11,783
Hey, man.

362
00:14:11,785 --> 00:14:13,251
You looking for your brother?

363
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:14,686
Or my m... um...

364
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,054
Charlotte?

365
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:17,455
Listen, um...

366
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:19,724
are they here? Because I haven't
been able to reach them.

367
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:21,125
No, they took off.

368
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:22,393
Couple hours ago.

369
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:24,012
Of course they did.

370
00:14:24,013 --> 00:14:25,630
And why would they bother
to let me know?

371
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:27,599
I could try
to call them for you.

372
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:29,000
Don't worry about it, Dan.

373
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:30,635
I mean, with a brother
like Lucifer,

374
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:32,604
I really should be
used to this, right?

375
00:14:32,606 --> 00:14:33,905
Hey.

376
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:36,307

Bianca's your client.

406
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:51,049
I'm not the same woman I was
when she hired me.

407
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:52,884
Hmm. Did you have
a change of heart?

408
00:15:52,886 --> 00:15:54,152
No, the same heart.

409
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:55,920
Completely different soul,
though.

410
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:57,956
Hmm.

411
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,624
There's Chet.

412
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,426
I'll go talk to him.

413
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:03,227
MOM: You know, that's wise.
You seem more his type

414
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:05,063
than me, and you're not
particularly intimidating,

415
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:07,398
so that should help.
Help what?

416
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,467
Well, in seducing him,
of course.

417
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,437
I'm not gonna seduce him,
Charlotte.

418
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:14,572
Not with that posture
you're not.

419
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:15,707
Fine.

420
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:17,008
I'll do it.
No. No.

421
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,443
There's gonna be no seducing.

422
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:20,178
We just need
to get Chet to talk,

423
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,679
have him incriminate himself,

424
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:24,015
then we can arrest him
and flip him on Bianca.

425
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:26,484
MOM: You expect him
to betray his own mother?

426
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:29,754
One that's given him
everything he's ever wanted?

427
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:32,557
Not all kids appreciate what
their parents have given them.

428
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:33,758
Well, that I agree with.

429
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,427
I just think with
a little pressure, he'll crack.

430
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,363
Oh, bodyguard.

431
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:41,165
Maybe he's not as easy
to get to as I thought.

432
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,800
MOM: Why would
an overprotective mother

433
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:45,069
bring her murderous son
to a tequila-fueled party?

434
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:46,671
Well, if her son
killed Zeke,

435
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,673
she has no idea.

436
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,080

You can't do this to her.

441
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:07,492
Well, I'm afraid that she
brought this on herself.

So, unless
there's something...

specific that you can tell me,

444
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:13,965

Oh, that's quite flattering.

00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:26,144
The worst patient
anyone could ask for.

451
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:27,612

selfish, narcissistic
little devil.

453
00:17:30,784 --> 00:17:32,350
He's greedy...

454
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:34,452
Is there a-a point to this?

455
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:35,987
Yes, I'm wondering
the same thing.

456
00:17:35,989 --> 00:17:38,256
The point is,
despite all of that,

457
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:40,792
she went out of her way
to help him.

458
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:42,126
Yeah, she's right.

459
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:43,194
The doctor has

460
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:45,329
seen a side to me that I hide

461
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:47,398
because it's, well, terrifying.

462
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,134
But she accepted me nonetheless,
and she's helped me

463
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:52,403
through issues
that I thought insurmountable.

464
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,007
I appreciate the testimonial,

465
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:59,077
and I will include it
into the notes.

466
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,512

00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:07,318
Well, she's generous.

470
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,220
As a, as a therapist,
as a lover,

471
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:10,455
a friend...
Wait.

472
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:14,659
You slept with your therapist.
What?

473
00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:16,360
O-Only in the beginning.
Then she decided

474
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:18,429
that I shouldn't
pay for therapy with sex.

475
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,498
So, such strong morals,
don't you think?

476

What the...?

478
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:24,735
Oh, no, no, she saved my life.

479
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:26,270
I mean, granted,
she killed me first,

480
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,905
but I did ask her.
Oh, my God.

481
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:29,273
Lucifer.

482
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:35,847

Charlotte. Excuse me.

484
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:39,383
Oh.

485
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:41,152
Mmm.

486
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:42,920
So glad you can make it.
How are the children?

487
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:44,455
They're angels.

488
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:47,959
But speaking of children...

489
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:49,193
What did Chet do now?

490
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:52,296
Run out on another tab?

491
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:56,467
The police suspect him
of killing Zeke Moore.

492
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,403
That's impossible.
I have it from

493
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:00,471
a very good source.

494
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:03,141

00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:05,977

You see, this is

Smuggling up
rare artifacts on the side.

Oh.

you wouldn't laugh.

540
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:52,850
I went through a lot

541
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:54,252
this last year.

542
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:57,622
And improv sort of helped me
reorient myself.

543
00:20:57,624 --> 00:21:00,258
How?

544
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,261
Well, it took stepping
outside of myself

545
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:05,796
to figure out
who I really was.

546
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:08,933
You know, stop defining myself
by other people.

547
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:11,202
Chloe. Lucifer.

548
00:21:11,204 --> 00:21:12,536
I see.

549
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:15,206
So you think I'm defining myself
by my brother, yeah?

550
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,474
Well, I know from experience,

551
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:19,010
the dude casts
a pretty big-ass shadow.

552
00:21:19,012 --> 00:21:21,946
Well, if there is one constant
in the universe,

553
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:24,248
it's that
Lucifer's the favorite.

554
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,050
No matter what I do.

555
00:21:26,052 --> 00:21:30,021
No matter how hard I work
or how much he screws up.

556
00:21:30,023 --> 00:21:32,923
It's never gonna change.

557
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:39,130
You guys must have competed
over everything, huh?

558
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:40,498
(chuckles)

559
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,166
I mean, he would never
admit it, right?

560
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:44,802
But yeah. Yeah, everything.

561
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:47,305
Even women?

562
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:49,273
Eh, I just noticed that

563
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:50,608
you and Lucifer
have a weird relationship

564
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:51,709
with Charlotte Richards.

565
00:21:51,711 --> 00:21:53,010
I just thought maybe you guys...

566
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:55,313
No, Dan, we are not
competing over Charlotte.

567
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:56,547
Trust me.

568
00:21:58,384 --> 00:22:00,351
At least,
not in the way you think.

569
00:22:00,353 --> 00:22:04,188
And if we are,
well, obviously I lost.

570
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,190
Because I'm here, with you.

571
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:07,224
(laughs)

572
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:09,193
No offense.

573
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:11,862
Yeah, none taken.

574
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:12,830
Oh, man.

575
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:15,700
They couldn't
crack the passcode.

576
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:17,635
But, uh, for what it's worth,

577
00:22:17,637 --> 00:22:21,072

605
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:24,468
Dan. Hey. Look, that phone--

606
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,837
I think it is way more important
than we thought.

607
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:30,040
It might be the key
to taking down Bianca.

608
00:23:32,145 --> 00:23:33,644
Great. Now that
we've solved that,

609
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:35,379
I can get back
to the case and...

610
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:38,249
Ooh! God! What?!

611
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:40,251
What? You just
made everything worse.

612
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:42,787
Why am I surprised?
Just leave.

613
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:45,289
Since that's been your plan
all along anyway.

614
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,558
Is that what all
this has been about?

615
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,126
(short laugh)

616
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:52,029
Amenadiel told you about our
trip back to Heaven, didn't he?

617
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:53,998
Don't you blame him.

618
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,500
You...
Aah!

619
00:23:55,501 --> 00:23:57,001
...should have told me.
Well, if you understood

620
00:23:57,003 --> 00:23:58,369
the full picture...

621
00:23:58,371 --> 00:23:59,537
Oh!

622
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:00,971
Stop hitting me.

623
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:02,306
Then explain.

624
00:24:02,308 --> 00:24:04,308
Well, I'd like to, but
you have a tendency

625
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,943
to get emotional
about things.

626
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,211
Aah!

627
00:24:07,213 --> 00:24:08,712
Case in point.

628
00:24:08,714 --> 00:24:10,681
So I needed to be controlled,
is that it?

629
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:13,818
What the hell am I, Lucifer--
a pawn in some plan of yours?

630
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,653
No, I wouldn't put it like that.

631
00:24:15,655 --> 00:24:17,655
Of course<i> you</i> wouldn't,
because that would actually

632
00:24:17,657 --> 00:24:20,858
require you understanding
how you affect people.

633
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,694
How you hurt them.
Oh! Aah!

634
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:26,063
You seem to be the one doing
the hurting at the moment.

635
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:28,666
You don't care about anyone
other than yourself.

636
00:24:28,668 --> 00:24:31,569
Unless they can be
of use to you.

637
00:24:32,605 --> 00:24:34,371
Sound familiar?

638
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:37,875
Tread very carefully, Maze.

639
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:43,547
You're just like your parents.

640
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:50,221
Aah!

641
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,493
(yelling)

642
00:24:55,495 --> 00:24:56,827
(growling)

643
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:03,534
(panting)

644
00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:10,508
Maybe... maybe we should

645
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,877
just take a time-out so that...

646
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:14,812
you can catch your breath.

647
00:25:14,814 --> 00:25:16,647
Yeah, so you can
catch your breath.

648
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:20,651
And then, I'll get back
to kicking your ass.

649
00:25:22,455 --> 00:25:24,221
(groans)

650
00:25:24,223 --> 00:25:26,056
See, now...

651
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:29,159
I had no idea that
you were this mad at me.

652
00:25:32,465 --> 00:25:34,732
You were gonna leave me.

653
00:25:36,736 --> 00:25:38,936
I would never do that.

654
00:25:38,938 --> 00:25:42,673
But you told Amenadiel
and your mom

655
00:25:42,675 --> 00:25:45,843
that y... you were
going with them to Heaven.

656
00:25:45,845 --> 00:25:48,946
Well, I didn't say how long for.

657
00:25:48,948 --> 00:25:50,681
Huh?

658
00:25:50,683 --> 00:25:53,050
Or what I was gonna do
when I got there.

659
00:25:56,556 --> 00:25:58,956
You're playing your own angle.

660
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:04,328
(both laugh)

661
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,830
And you didn't tell me...

662
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:11,001
...because you needed me
to be angry with you

663
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:14,405
(laughs)
so you could sell your story.

664
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:16,407
Exactly! (laughs)

665
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:19,176
So, all this...

666
00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:20,511
was for nothing.

667
00:26:20,513 --> 00:26:22,112
(laughs)

668
00:26:23,983 --> 00:26:27,184
Lucifer, that's even worse.

669
00:26:35,895 --> 00:26:37,227
ELLA:
<i> This phone</i>

670
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:39,830
could be the key to taking down
the entire Ruiz empire.

671
00:26:39,832 --> 00:26:42,800
Yeah, but how do we crack it
if cyber couldn't even do it?
Time.

672
00:26:42,802 --> 00:26:44,602
That idiot
didn't install a program

673
00:26:44,604 --> 00:26:45,970
that can remotely
wipe the phone.

674
00:26:45,972 --> 00:26:49,173
And it's an older phone
with just a four-digit code.

675
00:26:49,175 --> 00:26:50,741
So, what, we just
keep trying till we get in?

676
00:26:50,743 --> 00:26:51,742
How long will that take?

677
00:26:51,744 --> 00:26:53,177
There are only 10,000 options.

678
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:54,278
Well, actually,

679
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,647
9,996 now--
I took a couple stabs.

680
00:26:56,649 --> 00:26:58,482
So, hey, making progress.

681
00:26:58,484 --> 00:27:00,217
I would say maybe a month.

682
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:02,086
Well, we can't arrest 'em till
we know what's on that phone.

683
00:27:02,088 --> 00:27:03,921
And if they decide
to make a run for it...
All right.

684
00:27:03,923 --> 00:27:05,623
Let's just try to speed it up.
Let's look into

685
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:07,257
Chet's background, let's try
and come up with number

686
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:09,660
combinations that might be
meaningful to him, all right?

687
00:27:09,662 --> 00:27:11,929
Let's go.

688
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,833
Did you guys...

689
00:27:15,835 --> 00:27:18,035
kill the chairman
of the review board?

690
00:27:18,037 --> 00:27:19,837
Please tell me you
didn't kill him.

691
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:21,672
Not that he
didn't deserve it,

692
00:27:21,674 --> 00:27:24,742
the smug, insufferable...
LUCIFER: No, no.

693
00:27:24,744 --> 00:27:27,211
No one's dead.
We did this to each other.

694
00:27:27,213 --> 00:27:28,379
Though... (sighs)

695
00:27:28,381 --> 00:27:31,348
when it comes to your case,
I fear I may have, um...

696
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,050
complicated things.

697
00:27:34,053 --> 00:27:35,786
Lucifer told him
you used to screw.

698
00:27:35,788 --> 00:27:38,155
Among other things.
Oh?

699
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:40,157
Oh.

700
00:27:42,662 --> 00:27:44,161
Well, I guess that's that.

701
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:46,363
No, that isn't that.
I want to know why

702
00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:47,364
she's still upset with me.

703
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:49,099
Since I'm not currently
a practicing

704
00:27:49,101 --> 00:27:51,068
doctor of psychiatry,
I don't have to lead you

705
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:53,804
on this path of realization;
I can just tell you.

706
00:27:53,806 --> 00:27:57,441
Maze is pissed at you
because you used her.

707
00:27:57,443 --> 00:27:59,043
Sure.

708
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:02,379
But for the greater good
of our debauchery here in L.A.

709
00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:04,281
Did you even once think
of how this affected her?

710
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:05,883
Of course I did.

711
00:28:05,885 --> 00:28:07,951
Thought about how
she might ruin everything

712
00:28:07,953 --> 00:28:11,555
by disemboweling my mum
or castrating my brother.

713
00:28:11,557 --> 00:28:13,257
I meant her feelings.

714
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:14,258
What?

715
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,626
She thought

716
00:28:15,628 --> 00:28:18,829
you abandoned her.

717
00:28:18,831 --> 00:28:21,899
That you didn't care
how that affected her.

718
00:28:21,901 --> 00:28:25,102
But those sort of things
never bothered her be...

719
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:30,941
...before.

720
00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:34,812
Oh.

721
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:39,049
Mazikeen.

722
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:41,318
I didn't realize...

723
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:48,258
I should have realized.

724
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:56,100
Well, my work
here is done.

725
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,838
Literally.

726
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,139
So, if you'll excuse me,

727
00:29:02,141 --> 00:29:06,243
I'm going to find
a very stiff martini.

728
00:29:14,053 --> 00:29:15,519
Linda.

729
00:29:16,689 --> 00:29:18,689
I'll take care of this.

730
00:29:18,691 --> 00:29:20,524
I promise.

731
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:35,005
Bianca.

732
00:29:35,007 --> 00:29:36,607
Has something happened?

733
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:39,810
Yes.

734
00:29:39,812 --> 00:29:42,412
My son robbed and killed Zeke,
as you know.

735
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:43,781
But then he showed me

736
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:45,749
what Zeke was smuggling.

737
00:29:45,751 --> 00:29:47,351
And for whom.

738
00:29:47,353 --> 00:29:50,254
Now I have it.

739
00:29:50,256 --> 00:29:53,223
And I think it's very important
to you, isn't it?

740
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:55,859
It is.
Then let's make a deal.

741
00:29:55,861 --> 00:29:58,695
I'll give it to you
if you get

742
00:29:58,697 --> 00:30:00,230
my son's phone from the police.

743
00:30:00,232 --> 00:30:01,498
(scoffs)

744
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,766
That's not possible.

745
00:30:02,768 --> 00:30:05,102
You'll find a way.

746
00:30:05,104 --> 00:30:08,038
Otherwise, I'll make sure
that what you want...

747
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,574
disappears forever.

748
00:30:23,923 --> 00:30:26,924
ELLA:
Birthday reverse. Nope.

749
00:30:26,926 --> 00:30:29,359
Double 69.

750
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:31,562
Oddly relieved
that's not it.

751
00:30:33,232 --> 00:30:35,065
Ms. Lopez.

752
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:37,768
We haven't really
had the chance to meet.

753
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:41,004
I know. I've been looking
forward to a formal "hey-ya."

754
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:43,674
S... Uh, no,
I see you're still

755
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:45,843
working on the phone.

756
00:30:45,845 --> 00:30:47,411
I knew Chet well.

757
00:30:47,413 --> 00:30:50,681
Perhaps I could borrow it,
maybe try some combinations?

758
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:53,383
I see through you.

759
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:57,588
I know you are
waiting around

760
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:59,189
for my boy Dan.

761
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:00,791
Oh.

762
00:31:00,793 --> 00:31:01,925
Caught me red-handed.

763
00:31:01,927 --> 00:31:04,828
And even though
most everybody

764
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,129
is all like,

765
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:07,364
(clicks tongue)
"She a shark,

766
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:10,000
those dead eyes,
don't trust her,"

767
00:31:10,002 --> 00:31:12,002
when I look at you...

768
00:31:12,004 --> 00:31:14,171
I see a light.

769
00:31:14,173 --> 00:31:16,340
Did my bandage come undone?

770
00:31:16,342 --> 00:31:20,844
So, for now,
benefit of the doubt.

771
00:31:20,846 --> 00:31:23,213
But if you ever
hurt Dan again,

772
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:25,415
I'll have someone
break your legs.

773
00:31:27,987 --> 00:31:30,053
(phone vibrating)

774
00:31:31,624 --> 00:31:33,657
Oh, that's my brother.
I've been trying

775
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:36,293
to get ahold
of him forever.

776
00:31:36,295 --> 00:31:37,694
Can you watch
the phone?

777
00:31:37,696 --> 00:31:39,763
Sure.

778
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:41,765
Thanks.

779
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:44,968
See? Light.

780
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:48,572
(chuckles)

781
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:53,510
Start talking.

782
00:31:55,848 --> 00:31:57,281
(sighs)

783
00:31:58,984 --> 00:32:01,184
<i> (piano playing dark melody)</i>

784
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:10,193
(elevator bell dings)

785
00:32:10,195 --> 00:32:11,395
Ah!

786
00:32:11,397 --> 00:32:15,132
(plays Britney Spears'
"Oops!... I Did it Again")

787
00:32:15,134 --> 00:32:16,533
What happened to you?

788
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:20,037
Oh, this. It's just a little
fisticuffs between friends.

789
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:22,606
I just had
a very enlightening conversation

790
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:23,707
with Charlotte Richards.

791
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:25,208
Ah. Well, I've had my fill

792
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,344
of enlightening conversations
for today, thank you.

793
00:32:27,346 --> 00:32:30,981
Lucifer, she told me
who she really is,

794
00:32:30,983 --> 00:32:32,683
and how you two are related.

795
00:32:32,685 --> 00:32:35,686
I somehow doubt that.

796
00:32:35,688 --> 00:32:37,254
It all makes sense.

797
00:32:37,256 --> 00:32:38,689
Why you were so disgusted

798
00:32:38,691 --> 00:32:41,124
when I suggested you two
had slept together.

799
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:43,093
Why you act so weird
around her in general.

800
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:45,162
She... really told you.

801
00:32:45,164 --> 00:32:46,563
What did she tell you?

802
00:32:46,565 --> 00:32:49,333
That she's your father's ex.

803
00:32:51,503 --> 00:32:53,804
Right, yes, no.
That's-that's true.

804
00:32:53,806 --> 00:32:54,972
Right, yeah.

805
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:57,007
I mean, the way
she talked about your dad

806
00:32:57,009 --> 00:32:58,608
and-and what he put her through.

807
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:02,012
Mm-hmm. Betrayal,
torture, Hell, et cetera.

808
00:33:02,014 --> 00:33:03,280
All true.
Mm-hmm.

809
00:33:03,282 --> 00:33:07,084
I just cannot imagine raising
kids with someone like that.

810
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:08,885
Sympathy for the
goddess, Detective?

811
00:33:08,887 --> 00:33:10,320
(sighs)

812
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:12,556
Why didn't you just tell me
she was your stepmom?

813
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:17,227
Well, it didn't seem
that simple to explain.

814
00:33:17,229 --> 00:33:18,996
I mean, how did this
all come about, anyway?

815
00:33:18,998 --> 00:33:20,998
Well... (sighs)

816
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,700
I... I caught Charlotte
trying to steal evidence

817
00:33:23,702 --> 00:33:25,736
for Bianca Ruiz.

818
00:33:25,738 --> 00:33:26,970
What?

819
00:33:26,972 --> 00:33:28,271
Why would she do that?

820
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:29,706
Well, apparently
Bianca figured out

821
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:31,708
that Charlotte and I were
working together at the sting.

822
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,210
Bianca threatened
Charlotte's family.

823
00:33:33,212 --> 00:33:35,112
I mean, she threatened you
if she didn't help.

824
00:33:35,114 --> 00:33:38,815
Well, that sounds plausible,
yes.

825
00:33:38,817 --> 00:33:40,650
I don't know.

826
00:33:40,652 --> 00:33:42,319
Something about it
doesn't feel right.

827
00:33:42,321 --> 00:33:45,055
I don't know if
I can trust her.

828
00:33:45,057 --> 00:33:46,523
Well, I mean, I know I'm biased,

829
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:48,525
but one thing's for certain,
Detective:

830
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:50,594
Charlotte Richards
will stop at nothing

831
00:33:50,596 --> 00:33:52,095
to protect her children.

832
00:33:53,499 --> 00:33:55,732
You can trust that.

833
00:33:55,734 --> 00:33:57,134
Hmm.

834
00:33:57,136 --> 00:33:59,903
Did you bring me
what I asked for?

835
00:33:59,905 --> 00:34:01,371
Mm.

836
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:05,042
As promised.

837
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:08,879
Make sure it's real.

838
00:34:08,881 --> 00:34:10,814
That it wasn't cloned.

839
00:34:18,624 --> 00:34:20,624
(liquid pouring)

840
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:28,799
To the things a mother will do
for her children.

841
00:34:28,801 --> 00:34:32,135
I'll drink to that.

842
00:34:32,137 --> 00:34:33,670
BIANCA:
I can't even count the times

843
00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:34,738
that Chet has come close

844
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,406
to destroying everything
I've built.

845
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:39,209
MOM: Children always find
new ways to test us.

846
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:41,144
She's talking
about Amenadiel.

847
00:34:41,146 --> 00:34:43,080
MOM:
Put us through... hell.

848
00:34:43,082 --> 00:34:44,414
That one's me.

849
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,316
BIANCA:
And yet we still protect them.

850
00:34:46,318 --> 00:34:47,717
MOM:
Always.

851
00:34:50,189 --> 00:34:52,456
(computer trilling)

852
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:00,430
Now for your side
of the bargain.

853
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:02,132
(gasps)

854
00:35:02,134 --> 00:35:04,801
(clears throat)

855
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:07,637
(static crackling)

856
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:09,239
We lost the feed.

857
00:35:09,241 --> 00:35:10,574
She's up to something.
Well, no, no, no.

858
00:35:10,576 --> 00:35:11,875
She may have just
shorted the bug.

859
00:35:11,877 --> 00:35:13,443
No. Charlotte Richards
is either screwing us over

860
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:14,911
or she's in trouble.

861
00:35:14,913 --> 00:35:16,146
Guys, get ready to go in.

862
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:18,348
And she better
be in trouble.

863
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:24,387
This opens a
safety deposit box.

864
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:26,490
Inside you'll find what Zeke
was smuggling for you.

865
00:35:26,492 --> 00:35:28,558
This isn't what we agreed to.

866
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,361
How do I know you'll hold up
your end of the deal?

867
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:33,396
Because I always do.

868
00:35:33,398 --> 00:35:34,831
And quite honestly,
I don't see why

869
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:36,900
you put so much value in...
(door opens)

870
00:35:36,902 --> 00:35:38,335
Freeze!
See your hands!

871
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:43,039
LAPD. Bianca Ruiz,
you're under arrest.

872
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:44,774
This is absurd.

873
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:47,244
Charlotte. Charlotte.

874
00:35:47,246 --> 00:35:49,846
Will no longer be
representing you.

875
00:35:49,848 --> 00:35:53,383
You're making
a terrible mistake.

876
00:35:55,187 --> 00:35:56,319
Don't touch me.

877
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:59,222
Charlotte, are you okay?

878
00:35:59,224 --> 00:36:00,357
Yes.
Lucifer, don't.

879
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:01,758
Step away.
I need to search her.

880
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,027
Well, I don't think
that's necessary, Detective.

881
00:36:04,029 --> 00:36:07,130
Well, I do.
It's okay, son.

882
00:36:07,132 --> 00:36:08,465
Fine.

883
00:36:08,467 --> 00:36:09,866
Arms out.

884
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:14,204
Hmm.

885
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,842
Oh, you're being
incredibly thorough.

886
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:20,844
I like it.

887
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:22,746
(clears throat)

888
00:36:22,748 --> 00:36:24,881
She's clean.
Well, I told you, Detective,

889
00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:26,583
she's got nothing to hide.

890
00:36:26,585 --> 00:36:28,385
MAN: The phone
was still unlocked.

891
00:36:28,387 --> 00:36:29,853
We have everything.

892
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:32,189
Seems like we do.

893
00:36:33,992 --> 00:36:35,192
Let's, uh...

894
00:36:49,074 --> 00:36:50,874
A book?

895
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:52,842
That's what Zeke smuggled
for me?

896
00:36:54,146 --> 00:36:56,680
Is this a joke?

897
00:36:56,682 --> 00:36:58,615
Well, if it were, I would have
chosen something funnier,

898
00:36:58,617 --> 00:37:00,817
like Douglas Adams or Freud.

899
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:03,486
Are you certain that this is
all that was in

900
00:37:03,488 --> 00:37:05,455
the safety deposit box?
(sighs)

901
00:37:05,457 --> 00:37:08,124
Well, how is a book supposed
to ignite the sword?

902
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:09,693
Maybe it's
an instruction manual.

903
00:37:11,663 --> 00:37:14,631
MOM: In an ancient language
I can't read.

904
00:37:14,633 --> 00:37:16,299
Wonderful.

905
00:37:16,301 --> 00:37:17,567
Here.

906
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:19,202
Wh-- I can't read it.

907
00:37:19,204 --> 00:37:21,705
But you speak every language.

908
00:37:21,707 --> 00:37:23,240
Speak, not read.

909
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,774
I've always found tongues
much more useful than books.

910
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:26,142
So whatever
language this is...

911
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,978
It's Sumerian.

912
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:30,580
Unlike some of us who had
everything handed to him,

913
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:34,284
I actually spent
my youth studying.

914
00:37:34,286 --> 00:37:36,019
(chuckles):
Excellent.

915
00:37:36,021 --> 00:37:38,788
My smart boy.

916
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:42,125
How-how quickly
can you translate it?

917
00:37:42,127 --> 00:37:44,461
Um, should only
take me a few days.

918
00:37:44,463 --> 00:37:46,129
(chuckles)
Days?

919
00:37:46,131 --> 00:37:47,797
I don't have that kind of time.

920
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:50,667
Mum, why have you got your
knickers in such a twist?

921
00:37:50,669 --> 00:37:53,069
Is there a reason why you're
in such a rush lately?

922
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:56,273
I-I'm just anxious to see
the rest of the family.

923
00:37:57,209 --> 00:38:00,710
Please start translating.

924
00:38:04,249 --> 00:38:06,516
There's something
going on with her.

925
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:10,654
Yeah. Or it's just that
time of the millennium.

926
00:38:12,758 --> 00:38:14,758
What?

927
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:25,101
Excuse me.

928
00:38:25,103 --> 00:38:27,771
Not this time.

929
00:38:31,877 --> 00:38:32,876
(knocks)

930
00:38:32,878 --> 00:38:34,577
Hey.
Hey.

931
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:36,579
Congrats on nabbing
Queen Tequila.

932
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:39,316
Well, Chet's still out there,

933
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:42,018
so this isn't over
until I find him.

934
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,653
You and Charlotte Richards--

935
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:45,989
that is the most awkward team-up
of the century.

936
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:49,726
(chuckles) Actually, it wasn't
as bad as I expected.

937
00:38:49,728 --> 00:38:52,128
I learned a lot of
eye-opening things about her.

938
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:54,764
That's for sure. Like her
being Lucifer's stepmom.

939
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:56,533
Had no idea...
Wait a minute.

940
00:38:56,535 --> 00:38:59,035
She-- Stepmom?

941
00:38:59,037 --> 00:39:00,036
Yeah.

942
00:39:00,038 --> 00:39:01,438
Yes.

943
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,408
That makes a weird amount
of sense, actually.

944
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:07,911
Dan, I want you to be
careful with her.

945
00:39:07,913 --> 00:39:09,546
There's something about her
I don't trust.

946
00:39:09,548 --> 00:39:11,881
I'm gonna be fine, Chloe.

947
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,485
Wait.
One more thing.
Yeah.

948
00:39:15,487 --> 00:39:18,388
If you married her,

949
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:21,057
you'd kind of be
like Lucifer's dad.

950
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:22,659
(laughs)

951
00:39:22,661 --> 00:39:24,561

952
00:39:24,563 --> 00:39:27,163

Huh?

981
00:41:06,364 --> 00:41:09,265
God shattered the Flaming Sword
into three distinct pieces.

"The Blade of Death."

983
00:41:10,669 --> 00:41:12,035

Azrael's.

AMENADIEL:
"The Medallion of Life."

985
00:41:13,872 --> 00:41:15,872
LUCIFER:
Johnson's belt buckle.

986
00:41:15,874 --> 00:41:19,542
And the key that binds them
all together.

987
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:24,447
Well, keys don't bind,
they unlock.

Well, don't leave me
in suspense.

992
00:41:38,163 --> 00:41:39,362
Who is it, brother?

993
00:41:39,364 --> 00:41:41,097
It says that God
entrusted the key

994
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:43,967
to his favorite son.

995
00:41:43,969 --> 00:41:45,835

996
00:41:46,771 --> 00:41:49,606
Of course he gave it to you.

1001
00:41:57,782 --> 00:42:00,283
What else did you bring
with you to Earth, Luci?

1002
00:42:00,285 --> 00:42:01,551
(chuckles softly)

1003
00:42:01,553 --> 00:42:03,953
Your ring.

1004
00:42:03,955 --> 00:42:06,122
I've never seen you without it;
maybe that's the key.

1005
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:08,825
Well, the key to completing
my ensemble maybe.

1006
00:42:08,827 --> 00:42:10,026
Here.

1007
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:12,662
Try and attach your ring
to this.

1008
00:42:12,664 --> 00:42:14,230
Brother.
Just do it.

1009
00:42:14,232 --> 00:42:16,065
And we'll confirm
what we already know.

1010
00:42:16,067 --> 00:42:18,167
Brother...
That Father's favorite,

1011
00:42:18,169 --> 00:42:19,602
despite everything
that you have done,

1012
00:42:19,604 --> 00:42:21,337
is and always has been you.

1013
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:23,106

1016
00:42:29,481 --> 00:42:31,748
or are you just
happy to see me?

1017
00:42:36,121 --> 00:42:39,556
He entrusted it...

1018
00:42:39,558 --> 00:42:42,125
to you, brother.
