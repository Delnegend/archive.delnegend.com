00:00:01,435 --> 00:00:03,335
<i> Previously on</i> Lucifer...
        DAN:<i> You stalked</i>

2
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:04,703
<i> your father's murderer</i>
  <i> right before he was killed.</i>

3
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:06,105
CHLOE:
     <i> I know this looks bad.</i>

4
00:00:06,107 --> 00:00:08,007
<i> Whoever killed Joe Fields</i>
       <i> killed my father.</i>

5
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:09,208
LUCIFER:
        <i> What, you think</i>
       <i> the warden did it?</i>

6
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,642
CHLOE:
   <i> This man killed my father.</i>

7
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:12,077
You tore

8
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:13,612
apart my family.

9
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:15,014
I can get you whatever you want.

10
00:00:15,016 --> 00:00:16,448
All I want is for you to know

11
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,617
that John Decker's kid got you.

12
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:20,319
DAN:<i> His name is Boris Sokolov.</i>
     <i> He connects criminals,</i>

13
00:00:20,321 --> 00:00:21,487
<i> but he always keeps</i>
      <i> his own hands clean.</i>

14
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:23,622
People call me
      Human Lie Detector.

15
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:25,958
So, you point me
     in the right direction

16
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,393
or I'm gonna make your
             life a living hell.

17
00:00:27,395 --> 00:00:29,661
Mom, this is Lucifer.
         Lucifer, Mom.

18
00:00:29,663 --> 00:00:31,330
Mama Decker.

19
00:00:31,332 --> 00:00:33,098
You shall remain
                      right here

20
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,667
on Earth amongst the creatures
        you so despise.

21
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:38,637
You're going to send me into
the life of Charlotte Richards?

22
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:41,040
I thought I'd dive
      into my employment.

23
00:00:41,042 --> 00:00:43,108
I was pretty surprised
             when you called me.

24
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,576
MOM:
   <i> You are fairly attractive.</i>

25
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:47,312
The only place I've ever felt

26
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:49,648
wanted or respected...

27
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,250
Is here with humanity?!

28
00:00:51,252 --> 00:00:53,185
This is my home!

29
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:54,486
Deal with it, Mother!

30
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:56,288
MOM:
       <i> You seem attached</i>

31
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,657
<i> to these creatures</i>
  <i> and I can't figure out why.</i>

32
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:01,727
Let me at least buy you dinner
     tonight to celebrate.

33
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:12,471
(beeping)

34
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:31,690
Excuse me.

35
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:32,724
Yeah. (chuckles)
            I'll get it for you.

36
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:33,859
Thank you.

37
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:37,963
AMENADIEL:
        You can't kill her, Mom.

38
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:39,631
Well, of course I can.

39
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:41,467
I just press this button.

40
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:43,268
Mom, please...

41
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,369
give me the detonator.

42
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:46,939
No.
 This little bug is the reason

43
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:48,574
that Lucifer doesn't
        want to go home.

44
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:50,876
Squash her, problem solved.

45
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:52,478
Are you really gonna make me
    force it away from you?

46
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,881
Trust me,
   you don't want to do that.

47
00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:57,716
But I can't let you kill Chloe,
              Mom.

48
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:00,219
(grunts)

49
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:01,320
Since when can you...

50
00:02:01,322 --> 00:02:02,654
I tried to warn you.

51
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:04,990
Apparently,
    paltry human flesh can't

52
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:07,226
contain my divinity.

53
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:08,961
Oh, here we go.

54
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:12,364
Bomb's in the car.

55
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:13,765
So exciting.

56
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:19,304
(giggles)

57
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:20,772
Mom, stop!

58
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:23,375
I am trying to help you.

59
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:25,310
I know Lucifer better
than he knows himself

60
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:26,612
and if you kill Chloe,

61
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:28,780
he won't rest
 until he finds out who did it

62
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:30,516
and when he does, Mom,

63
00:02:30,518 --> 00:02:32,017
he will hate you forever.

64
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:33,752
Come on.

65
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:36,922
One little human can't mean
  more to him than his family.

66
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:38,957
He killed Uriel to protect her.

67
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,527
Well...

68
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:43,462
what's so damn special
                 about this one?

69
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:44,930
That I don't know.

70
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:46,532
But, Mom, the bottom line is

71
00:02:46,534 --> 00:02:48,534
if we want Luci
      to go home with us,

72
00:02:48,536 --> 00:02:51,270
then we need to make sure
     that it's his decision

73
00:02:51,272 --> 00:02:52,471
to leave Chloe behind.

74
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:58,710
Well, that was anticlimactic.

75
00:02:58,712 --> 00:02:59,945
(groans)

76
00:02:59,947 --> 00:03:00,946
(shouts)

77
00:03:00,948 --> 00:03:01,947
So, I need to find

78
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:02,948
a more subtle way

79
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,651
to end Lucifer's silly crush.

80
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:07,286
(sighs)

81
00:03:07,288 --> 00:03:08,654
LINDA:
      <i> Tell me everything.</i>

82
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:09,788
Well, there's...

83
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,957
nothing to say, really.

84
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:13,292
You had a date...

85
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:14,426
with Chloe.

86
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:16,795
That's a big deal,
                        Lucifer.

87
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:19,031
I need to hear about it.

88
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:21,500
You know, as your therapist.

89
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:24,903
Well, for one, I wouldn't say
    it was a big deal and...

90
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:27,339
it wasn't a date, just dinner...

91
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:29,074
more like a snack, actually,
        between friends.

92
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:30,375
Oh, how was the food?

93
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:31,910
I've heard their branzino
          is amazing.

94
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:33,979
Well, yeah, it's...

95
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:35,447
hard to say, really.

96
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:36,848
Too caught up in the moment
           to notice?

97
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,650
Caught up, in-in a way, yes.

98
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:41,853
You chickened out, didn't you?

99
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:43,822
(laughing):
             What?

100
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,390
I'm the Devil, Doctor.

101
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:46,992
I don't chicken out.

102
00:03:46,994 --> 00:03:48,460
Ah.
I just simply
thought that she should

103
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:49,528
enjoy the food
without any...

104
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,597
distractions.

105
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,498
Listen, you
                 know, I get it.

106
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,467
Our last breakthrough
          spooked you

107
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:56,702
and now you're running scared.

108
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:59,538
I don't "run scared"
   any more than I "chicken."

109
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,373
(chuckles)
                  Not literally.

110
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,708
But you're avoiding
                      the truth.

111
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,709
Also known as lying.

112
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:05,877
That I know I don't do... ever.

113
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:06,878
But yet...

114
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,981
you are lying, Lucifer...

115
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:10,048
(laughs)

116
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,516
...to yourself.

117
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:14,753
¶ Hey! ¶

118
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,189
¶ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ¶

119
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,625
¶ Hey! ¶

120
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:22,027
¶ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ¶

121
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:25,030
¶ Hey. ¶

122
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:26,865
I owe you an explanation.

123
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:29,434
Really? Why?

124
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,869
Was it for...

125
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:33,005
leaving me all alone
 at a restaurant so the busboy

126
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:35,407
could give me pitiful
glances all night?

127
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:36,608
I know what your explanation is
        and I don't want

128
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,510
to know her name,
     especially not today.

129
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:40,145
Actually, Detective, that isn't
 what I was going to say, I...

130
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:42,014
Look, Lucifer,
I don't have time for this.

131
00:04:42,016 --> 00:04:43,649
I was just on my way out.

132
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:45,384
Besides, this is my fault.

133
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:48,020
I should've known how selfish
  and thoughtless you can be.

134
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:49,054
Lucifer.

135
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:50,055
(chuckles)

136
00:04:50,057 --> 00:04:51,590
How thoughtful.

137
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:52,658
Penelope.

138
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,559
You are the sweetest

139
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:57,396
to come support us
on such a difficult day.

140
00:04:57,398 --> 00:04:58,397
Oh.
           I bet you

141
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,431
an arm and a leg, Mom,

142
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:00,899
that he has no idea
         what today is.

143
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:02,901
Well, that's rather unwise
  of you to wager your lovely

144
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:04,536
extremities, Detective.

145
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:05,804
Particularly
     as I'm perfectly aware

146
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:06,905
of what today is, actually.

147
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:08,874
It's a very difficult day...

148
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:09,941
because...

149
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:11,810
Today.
                     Today is...

150
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,578
The first day
                the first day...

151
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,180
of the
                           of...

152
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:17,449
trial of
                 the trial of...

153
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:19,217
my dad's killer.
                my dad's killer!

154
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:21,486
Nietzsche? No, wait.

155
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:22,921
Your dad's killer.
     Yes, no, I knew that.

156
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:24,923
I knew that. That's why
       I'm here, to support you.

157
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:26,958
Not talk about myself
 'cause that would be selfish.

158
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,959
Yeah.
                           So...

159
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:28,960
consider me

160
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:30,128
an emotional jockstrap

161
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,130
for the Decker family jewels.
           (chuckles)

162
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:35,067
(whistling)

163
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:36,968
Hey.

164
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,970
Hmm, someone's chirpy
           for a Monday morning.

165
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:39,971
(chuckles)

166
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:41,973
Yes, I am.

167
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:42,974
Why?

168
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:44,042
What's going on?

169
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:46,111
What, do I need
an excuse to be happy?

170
00:05:46,113 --> 00:05:48,580
Hmm, I mean,
               you're whistling.

171
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:50,816
You've been...
             working out lately.

172
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:51,850
Mm.
                    (sniffs)

173
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,753
Musk-scented aftershave.

174
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,221
Did you...

175
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:57,222
get laid?

176
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:58,223
(laughs)

177
00:05:58,225 --> 00:05:59,458
(scoffs)
              No.

178
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,126
Oh, no, no.

179
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:02,994
Don't waste your poker
              face on me, buddy;

180
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:04,796
I know that grin.

181
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:07,132
I'm still in shock.

182
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:08,100
I knew it.

183
00:06:08,102 --> 00:06:09,801
She's gorgeous.
                     Yeah, well,

184
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:11,503
it's not like you're Quasimodo.
No, no, no, no.

185
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:12,804
Trust me,
  she is way out of my league.

186
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:13,872
I mean, she is

187
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,574
goddess-like.

188
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:17,008
And she came back for seconds.

189
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:20,145
Then maybe she's the one who
 sent you the mystery package.

190
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:23,482
A mystery package?

191
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:25,150
Mm-hmm.

192
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:30,255
I don't recognize
the return address.

193
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:36,161
Oh, jeez.

194
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:38,196
God!

195
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:40,031
(sighs)

196
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:43,101
Wish I could say
        it was my first.

197
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:48,907
That's Boris.

198
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,909
Chloe's gonna lose it.

199
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:58,517
So poised.

200
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:01,086
The detective obviously
     gets her strength from you.

201
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:02,587
(scoffs)
             This?

202
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:03,922
It's just acting.

203
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:07,259
Sadly, I've had... practice.

204
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:10,929
I played this role before,
16 years ago.

205
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:13,198
Well, maybe it's
                like butt stuff.

206
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:15,834
Easier the second
                    time around.

207
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:21,072
(whispering):
        The severed head
        of Boris Sokolov

208
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:22,207
just arrived at the precinct.

209
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:23,942
(whispering):
That's horrible!

210
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,043
Who's Boris?

211
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:26,545
He's the prosecution's
          key witness.

212
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:27,913
He's our key witness.

213
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:30,182
He was the only person
that could connect Perry

214
00:07:30,184 --> 00:07:31,716
to the Russian gang.
I mean, without him,

215
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:33,552
the entire case
could fall apart.

216
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:34,686
Oh, God.

217
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:36,888
How very convenient
         for Mr. Perry.

218
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,356
(sighs)

219
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:46,398
(whispering):
  This is the worst thing that
 could be happening right now.

220
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:54,773
¶ Before the storm
  there's a calm in the air ¶

221
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:57,576
¶ You're the daydream
  and I'll be your nightmare ¶

222
00:07:57,578 --> 00:07:58,677
¶ Turned your back ¶

223
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:00,612
¶ Thought that I'd disappear ¶

224
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:04,115
¶ But, honey, I'm right here ¶

225
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:05,350
¶ Whoa ¶

226
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:08,019
¶ Whoa, oh ¶

227
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:09,621
¶ Whoa ¶

228
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:12,858
¶ The queen is back. ¶

229
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,759
What are you up to now, Mother?

230
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:16,828
¶ ¶

231
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,673
I had no idea
Charlotte Richards

232
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,242
was defending Perry.

233
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:32,277
Wishing we hadn't saved
her life about now.

234
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,645
Well, not to worry,
                      Detective.

235
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:35,013
I hear Charlotte
              is a changed woman

236
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,615
since her
            disappearance, so...

237
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:38,783
maybe she's not the
             shark she once was.

238
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:40,752
At least not in the courtroom.

239
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:42,020
All rise.

240
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,256
Court is now in session.

241
00:08:44,258 --> 00:08:45,390
The Honorable Judge Estrada
           presiding.

242
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:47,626
Given the sudden death

243
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:48,927
of the State's
      number one witness,

244
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:52,264
I assume the defense
   is moving for a dismissal?

245
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:55,000
A motion for dismissal?

246
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:56,535
Why would I want that,
Your Honor?

247
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:58,537
(chuckles)
                 Looks like Jaws

248
00:08:58,539 --> 00:08:59,804
has been harpooned.

249
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:00,805
MOM:
                   My apologies.

250
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:02,641
I'm a little...
out of practice.

251
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:04,342
Um...

252
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:06,278
Oh, I see.

253
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,612
You're saying that
with Boris dead,

254
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:10,448
the State doesn't have
enough evidence to proceed?

255
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,350
So, if I don't
move for dismissal,

256
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:14,920
then he'll probably make
a complete fool of himself?

257
00:09:14,922 --> 00:09:16,054
Your Honor,
our case was

258
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,290
and still is unshakable.

259
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:19,624
The State has plenty

260
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:22,427
of other evidence
  that'll prove 16 years ago,

261
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:23,562
the defendant, Perry Smith,

262
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:25,430
murdered
Officer John Decker

263
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:27,632
and paid Joe Fields to go
   to prison for that crime.

264
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:29,401
Oh, and when Fields
wanted out of their deal,

265
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:30,435
Perry also killed him.

266
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:31,703
Your Honor,
     with all due respect,

267
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:32,704
granting a dismissal

268
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:33,939
would be ludicrous.

269
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:35,006
Boris Sokolov's death,

270
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:38,076
while undoubtedly tragic,

271
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,712
changes nothing.

272
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:42,948
Well, the defense agrees.

273
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,349
What?

274
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:46,851
His death doesn't
change a single thing.

275
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:49,521
With or without
Mr. Sokolov's testimony,

276
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:51,056
my client should never
have been charged

277
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:52,123
with these crimes.

278
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:54,426
Well...

279
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:56,895
seeing as both parties agree,

280
00:09:56,897 --> 00:09:58,597
the trial will proceed
          immediately.

281
00:09:58,599 --> 00:09:59,598
Actually, Your Honor,

282
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,999
the State would like to, uh,

283
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:02,100
request a continuance.

284
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,402
In light of the death
of our key witness,

285
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:07,105
our office needs time
       to, uh, reexamine

286
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,607
its strategy.

287
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:09,741
But I'm confused,
                     Your Honor.

288
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:11,509
Didn't we just hear
the prosecution say

289
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:13,712
their case was
"unshakable"?

290
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:15,447
We did.

291
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:16,548
Request denied.

292
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:20,018
Session will resume after lunch.

293
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,791
What the hell are you doing,
            Mother?

294
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,026
Oh, calm down, Lucifer.

295
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:29,594
This isn't pleasant
for me, either.

296
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:31,696
Oh, yes, I can see
   you're suffering terribly.

297
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:33,898
I was good up there,
wasn't I?

298
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,434
Not sure why humans spend
so much time in law school.

299
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:37,469
Two nights seemed plenty.

300
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:38,837
Mum.

301
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:41,640
I had to find a way
to open your eyes.

302
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:43,642
You need to see that
this Chloe you so adore

303
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:44,643
isn't worthy of you.

304
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:45,744
(scoffs)

305
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:47,045
I admit I enjoy working
            with her, but adore,

306
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:48,446
that's a bit much.

307
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:50,649
Oh, please. You've sacrificed
          more for her

308
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:52,450
than you ever have
        for anyone else.

309
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:55,153
Have you forgotten?
        You killed your brother,

310
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,655
my son, to protect her.

311
00:10:56,657 --> 00:11:00,058
Do you think there's anything
           even remotely similar

312
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,059
that she would do for you?

313
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:03,094
I suppose...

314
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:04,663
I don't know.

315
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:06,698
Well, if all goes according
      to plan in that courtroom,

316
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,966
you will know.

317
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:09,634
Know that she doesn't
                    deserve you,

318
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:10,935
because she doesn't
                  care about you

319
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:12,671
like you care about her.

320
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:14,773
You need to see that you're
       not meant to be together.

321
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:16,808
You belong with your family.

322
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,543
Which is why
       I have to do this.

323
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:20,211
Do what, Mum?

324
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,916
What sort of evil plan
      are you concocting?

325
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:27,419
And please don't tell me
   it began by killing Boris.

326
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:29,454
Oh, actually, that was
     just a happy twist of fate.

327
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:30,689
I was gonna
                  blow Chloe up,

328
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:31,923
but Amenadiel
            talked me out of it.

329
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:33,958
You what?!

330
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,095
Mother, I swear,
 if you hurt her, I will rip--

331
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:39,130
Well, looks like
         your brother was right.

332
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:43,702
Just promise me that
      you won't touch her.

333
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:48,139
I'm not going to hurt anyone.

334
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:55,680
Lucifer, you promise me,

335
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:58,717
whatever that was, that
    it doesn't affect the trial.

336
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:00,785
First of all, Detective,
there is no "that."

337
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:05,690
And secondly, rest assured,
everything will be okay.

338
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:07,125
I've got this.

339
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:17,068
You looking for Boris'
forensics report?

340
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,069
(sighs)

341
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,070
Uh-huh.

342
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,472
Hasn't come in yet.

343
00:12:20,474 --> 00:12:22,107
Ella should have it
any minute now.

344
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:25,210
I know this isn't my case,
      but I'm freaking out, Dan.

345
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:26,878
I can't let Perry get
           away with everything.

346
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,146
You won't.

347
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:30,148
You didn't see Charlotte
        Richards in court today.

348
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,516
(high-pitched): Char--?
      (clears his throat)

349
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:32,550
I'm sorry. Uh,

350
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:34,686
Charlotte Richards
is, uh, defending Perry?

351
00:12:34,688 --> 00:12:35,754
Yeah.

352
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:37,756
Really?
She's that good?

353
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:39,691
Yes, she's
                       the best.

354
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:41,693
Which is why it would
        be helpful if we could--

355
00:12:41,695 --> 00:12:43,695
Well, if you could tie
         Perry to Boris' murder.

356
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:46,131
Okay, well, motive
and M.O. line up.

357
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:47,699
Boris' tongue was cut out.

358
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:51,002
So the killer was sending
a really clear message--

359
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:52,771
loose lips get
their head clipped.

360
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:55,774
Perry did this so Boris
    couldn't testify, I know it.

361
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:58,143
But hasn't he been behind bars
since you arrested him?

362
00:12:58,145 --> 00:12:59,577
Yeah, but he could have
   orchestrated it in prison.

363
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:00,645
It's also his M.O.

364
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:02,647
Exactly, and if Perry
            is good at anything,

365
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:04,182
it's making other people
             pay for his crimes.

366
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:06,151
Okay, well, whoever
Perry hired to do this

367
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:07,285
was one sharp dude.

368
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:10,054
The cut on Boris' neck
is extremely precise.

369
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:13,057
I'm thinking industrial-size
professional slicer.

370
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:16,928
Listen, I'm gonna do
 everything I can to find him.

371
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,930
Even if I have to interview
           the owner

372
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:20,298
of every single
      meat slicer in L.A.

373
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,167
ELLA:
You won't have to.

374
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:25,136
There was also
non-human DNA on Boris.

375
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,071
Swine, to be exact.

376
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:29,674
A unique cross-bred
for its delicious meat.

377
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:32,076
And there's only
one place that sells it.

378
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:36,948
Ah!

379
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,683
Hi.

380
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:40,218
That's so sweet of you, but you
  don't have to stick around.

381
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,786
Trials can be so boring.
Well,

382
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:42,887
not this one.

383
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:43,822
What do you mean?

384
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:44,856
Mr. Morningstar,

385
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:46,658
we're ready for you.

386
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,693
Wonderful.
         Lovely. Right.

387
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:52,063
Off I go to shield you from
that Quid Pro Ho, Detective.

388
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,332
Lucifer, what are you doing?

389
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,701
Well, I figured
there's no reason for us

390
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:59,904
to lose our heads just
because Boris lost his.

391
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:04,642
I swear to tell the truth,
                the whole truth,

392
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:07,245
and nothing but the truth,

393
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:08,413
so help me Dad.

394
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:17,255
Mr. Morningstar,

395
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:20,191
you were there
    when Boris was arrested.

396
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,260
Right? Working with
Detective Espinoza.

397
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:24,229
That is correct.

398
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:26,064
Except I call him
       Detective Douche.

399
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:27,332
(laughter)

400
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:28,933
But that's another story.

401
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,003
So would you
please describe to us

402
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:33,137
what happened?

403
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:34,372
Yes, I'd love to, actually.

404
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,506
May-may I have the floor?

405
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:36,541
By all means.

406
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,276
LUCIFER:
                      Thank you.

407
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:40,278
I'm going to need...

408
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,247
Hello.

409
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:43,481
May I borrow your scarf?

410
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:46,017
Your Honor,
is this necessary?

411
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:48,253
Well, you want
   the full story, don't you?

412
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:50,154
I mean, the Devil's
        in the details.

413
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:52,190
Thank you ever so much.

414
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:56,294
Right. Myself
     and Detective Douche--

415
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:57,629
sorry, Detective Espinoza--

416
00:14:57,631 --> 00:14:59,397
were asked by the LAPD

417
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,165
to perform a sting operation.

418
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:02,267
Not the singer.

419
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:05,136
(laughter)
   So we had to go undercover

420
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:06,437
at Boris' bathhouse.

421
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:07,572
Guns of steel...

422
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,574
Got up there...
   (imitated slashing sound)

423
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,276
Walked over like
             he's constantly got

424
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:12,577
a gun between his legs...

425
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,580
Boris looked me in the eye,
          and he said,

426
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,615
(Russian accent): "People call
    me human lie detector."

427
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:19,050
He was going to kill...

428
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:21,419
Shook my hand like
 some kind of Roman warrior...

429
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,455
...and it was sealed, and I
 handed over the investigation

430
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:26,991
to Detective Decker.

431
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:28,393
Thank you.
      (laughter, applause)

432
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:29,661
¶ Stop draggin' me down ¶

433
00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:31,029
¶ ¶

434
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:34,399
¶ Stop dragging me down, yeah. ¶

435
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:37,936
DAN:
       I got a question.

436
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:40,038
Do you ever get the feeling
          like you've been used?

437
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,707
You mean, by--
       oh, I don't know--

438
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:46,544
the woman who's defending the
 killer of your ex-wife's dad?

439
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:47,645
What?

440
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:49,614
Charlotte Richards is
       the gorgeous lady

441
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:50,682
you slept with, right?

442
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:52,617
How the hell did
                  you know that?

443
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:55,286
Well, I saw a long,
honey-blonde hair

444
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,554
on your coat the other day.

445
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:58,957
It was curlier than Chloe's.
And then,

446
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,625
I spotted a smudge of lipstick

447
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,193
on your cuff--
burgundy shade.

448
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:05,697
Bold, but not too sexy.
         Lawyer color.

449
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:06,965
Really?

450
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:10,068
No. I just saw
your butt pucker

451
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,370
when Chloe mentioned her name
in the lab this morning.

452
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:14,105
God.

453
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:16,074
Why are you so worried?

454
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:17,709
I mean, you didn't tell her
anything about the case

455
00:16:17,711 --> 00:16:19,610
that she could
use in court, right?

456
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:22,647
I don't think so, but...
There you go.

457
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,082
Mezcal cocktails, man.

458
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:26,217
Oof. Those sneak up on you.

459
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:28,252
She did keep wanting
         to talk about our exes,

460
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:30,421
and all I thought was, you know
 what, she's so easy to talk to.

461
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:31,522
She's so sympathetic.

462
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:33,057
God, I'm such an idiot.

463
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:35,126
Hey...
     No, her taking Perry's case

464
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:36,527
right after we...

465
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,129
It can't be a coincidence.

466
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:40,264
Why not?

467
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:42,500
Maybe she really
just likes you.
                           Yeah.

468
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,535
44.
Hi. We'll take

469
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:46,070
the headless body of a dude
named Boris, please.

470
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,242
I was going
to call you guys.

471
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:53,077
I was just... scared.

472
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:56,014
A few days ago,
    this guy approached me.

473
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:57,281
Big creepy dude.

474
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:59,350
He demanded the keys to use
the equipment after hours.

475
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,552
No questions asked,
        unless I wanted

476
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:03,021
to end up in the sausage myself.

477
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:05,023
Do you know his name?
No.

478
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:07,091
Asian, big.

479
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:08,493
Very scary.

480
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:13,765
But the scar on his neck
     it's very distinctive.

481
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:16,501
Thank you, Mr. Morningstar.

482
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:18,703
What a, uh, vivid picture.

483
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:21,572
It's almost as if Boris
himself just testified.

484
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:23,808
(quietly): Except
a more handsome version.

485
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,810
Oh, stop it, Judy.

486
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:27,045
(chuckles)

487
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:28,446
(clears throat)
           Thank you.

488
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:29,647
Right actually,
                        to that,

489
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:31,149
I would like to add one
         more thing, if I may...

490
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:33,718
I think we've had
             enough, Your Honor.

491
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,452
Shh!

492
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:35,586
Please...

493
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:37,688
continue Luc--

494
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,258
Mr. Morningstar.

495
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,660
Thank you, my darling.

496
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:46,130
Yes, I'd just like to say,
                 for the record,

497
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:49,734
the LAPD, and Detective Decker,
         in particular,

498
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:52,470
acted impeccably
                   on this case.

499
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:55,640
This whole courtroom,
      nay, the entire city

500
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:58,342
can rest assured that
       someone as honest,

501
00:17:58,344 --> 00:18:01,746
trustworthy, and reliable
      as Detective Decker

502
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:04,148
is out there
                protecting them.

503
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:08,619
She is... truly good.

504
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:10,088
And I don't mean in bed.

505
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,589
I wouldn't know.

506
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,157
That's how good she is.

507
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:16,294
Thank you.

508
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:17,295
Miss Richards?

509
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:19,797
Your witness.

510
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:24,802
I have no questions
         at this time.

511
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:28,706
(thunder crashes)

512
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:38,883
Hey!

513
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:40,118
That's Chloe's car.

514
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,185
What are you looking for?

515
00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:42,253
Hey.

516
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:44,889
I was, um...

517
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:45,890
You.

518
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:47,792
I was looking for you.

519
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,393
Really?

520
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:50,795
Yeah, I've missed you.

521
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:55,333
It's true, I still
think about you, Maze.

522
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:58,936
Every day. And every time
that I see you, it's...

523
00:19:00,907 --> 00:19:02,773
I miss you, too.

524
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:12,416
It's like fireworks, isn't it?

525
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:14,552
(chuckles)

526
00:19:14,554 --> 00:19:16,554
But are you sure
                 that's the kind

527
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:17,855
you're looking for?

528
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:23,461
Or was it this?

529
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:31,936
One-- tell your mother no one
 is hurting Chloe on my watch.

530
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:33,404
And, two--

531
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:34,872
don't ever lie
     to me like that again.

532
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:53,191
STEDMAN:
 And what did Boris have to say

533
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:55,459
when you interrogated him?

534
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:57,595
He confessed that he
  routinely provided fall guys

535
00:19:57,597 --> 00:20:00,231
for the Russian gang
      that runs the prison

536
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:01,799
where the defendants worked
      since the late '90s.

537
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:04,135
STEDMAN: And is there
                   anything else

538
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:07,138
that is remarkable
       about this prison?

539
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,873
It is the very prison
        whose corruption

540
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,174
John Decker was investigating

541
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:11,876
when he was murdered
         16 years ago.

542
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,077
Holy cow.

543
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:16,180
It's all so coincidental,
           isn't it?

544
00:20:17,517 --> 00:20:19,884
Just like the odd timing
       of Boris' murder.

545
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:22,119
I withdraw that,
Your Honor.

546
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:23,487
No further questions.

547
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:25,590
Thank you, Detective.

548
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:31,562
I have no questions
       for this witness.

549
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,097
STEDMAN:
The prosecution rests,
Your Honor.

550
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:36,267
Your turn to shine,
         Ms. Richards.

551
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:38,736
As its first witness,

552
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:41,606
the defense would like
 to recall Lucifer Morningstar.

553
00:20:46,713 --> 00:20:48,813
Oh, it's fine.

554
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:52,783
Just one small question,
                Mr. Morningstar.

555
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:54,719
And please remember
that you're still

556
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:56,254
under oath.

557
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:58,155
Who was first
   on the Fields crime scene?

558
00:20:58,157 --> 00:21:01,659
First on the scene was
       the detective, I believe.

559
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:03,894
I'm sorry, which detective?

560
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:04,729
Detective Decker.

561
00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:06,197
MOM:
                   Are you sure?

562
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:07,298
How do you know?

563
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,532
LUCIFER: Quite sure.
              Yeah, she told me.

564
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:09,834
It's kind of strange,
isn't it,

565
00:21:09,836 --> 00:21:11,669
for the man accused
of killing John Decker

566
00:21:11,671 --> 00:21:13,938
to be found dead
by Decker's own daughter,

567
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,939
Chloe Decker?

568
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:16,607
Objection, Your Honor.
           Relevance?

569
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:17,675
I'm getting to that.

570
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:19,577
Would you please read who,

571
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:21,879
according to the
         official police report,

572
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:23,648
was the first officer
                   on the scene?

573
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:27,084
(whispering):
                   What's wrong?

574
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:28,552
I'll tell you later.

575
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:30,921
Well, it says
             Detective Espinoza.

576
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:33,958
I thought you said Chloe Decker
was an impeccable detective.

577
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,092
Objection, Your Honor!

578
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:36,327
No, I-I'd like
                 to answer that.

579
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:38,562
She is. That's why she

580
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:40,331
took herself off the
      investigation immediately.

581
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:43,200
But not until after she'd found
     her dad's killer dead?

582
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:44,769
(groans)
      STEDMAN: Objection!

583
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:46,704
What's he objecting to--
          air quotes?

584
00:21:46,706 --> 00:21:49,573
I'm simply stating that
 if what we just heard is true,

585
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:51,842
then there's a very plausible
       alternative story

586
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:53,911
to the one that the State
         is presenting.

587
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:56,580
Chloe Decker had motive,
          opportunity,

588
00:21:56,582 --> 00:21:59,116
and the LAPD to protect her
              and help her frame

589
00:21:59,118 --> 00:22:01,719
an innocent man
   for her personal vendetta.

590
00:22:01,721 --> 00:22:02,887
With all due respect,
          Your Honor,

591
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:04,955
Chloe Decker
     is not on trial here.

592
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:06,957
MOM: And my client
           shouldn't be, either.

593
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:08,592
Because it appears
                he is the victim

594
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:10,261
of the LAPD's incompetence.

595
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:14,932
Unless, of course,
      the report is right,

596
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:18,336
and it is you that is lying,
        Mr. Morningstar?

597
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:22,239
What you're implying
        is preposterous.

598
00:22:22,241 --> 00:22:24,342
The Detective
    would never hurt anyone.

599
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:29,980
But yes.

600
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:31,882
What I said is the truth.

601
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:34,118
Under oath or otherwise.

602
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,453
I don't lie.

603
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,860
LUCIFER:
           <i> Detective?</i>

604
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:45,262
Please.
            Trust me, you do not
   want to talk to me right now.

605
00:22:45,264 --> 00:22:46,997
You're right, I don't.
You look scary.

606
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:49,900
But look, I apologize
for my controversial testimony,

607
00:22:49,902 --> 00:22:51,235
but I was clearly bamboozled.

608
00:22:51,237 --> 00:22:55,172
You didn't expect me to lie
on the stand, did you?

609
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:57,108
It's not about your answers.

610
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:59,009
It's about Charlotte's
                      questions.

611
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:01,045
She wouldn't have even asked
  them unless she already knew

612
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:03,714
I was first on scene.

613
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,049
Let's see.
     Who could've told her?

614
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:06,283
Detective, I didn't.

615
00:23:06,285 --> 00:23:08,052
You say that,
               but you also said

616
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:11,188
your relationship with Charlotte
  wouldn't affect this trial.

617
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,257
It just did.

618
00:23:15,928 --> 00:23:17,928
Detective!

619
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,997
¶ ¶

620
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:26,437
Charlotte?

621
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:29,240
How could you do this to me?

622
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:30,808
What exactly?

623
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,343
I've done several things to you.

624
00:23:32,345 --> 00:23:34,278
Did you sleep with me
   to get intel on this case?

625
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,348
Of course, but it's not like you
  didn't get anything out of it.

626
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,683
"Mind altering,"
    I believe you called it.

627
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:41,952
Yeah, literally, apparently.

628
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:45,322
Because I don't remember telling
 you anything about this case.

629
00:23:45,324 --> 00:23:48,192
Did you roofie me or something?
I didn't need to.

630
00:23:48,194 --> 00:23:51,262
I've learned sex puts your
    gender into a mild coma.

631
00:23:51,264 --> 00:23:53,697
Offered the perfect window
   to go through your phone.

632
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:54,932
So, maybe...

633
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:57,301
next time, you should
      put your phone away

634
00:23:57,303 --> 00:23:58,803
before we have the sex.

635
00:23:58,805 --> 00:23:59,703
"Next time"?

636
00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:00,704
Mm-hmm.

637
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:01,972
Are you insane?

638
00:24:04,177 --> 00:24:05,543
(whispers):
          You tell me.

639
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,849
(sighs)

640
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,719
LINDA: I wish I could say
       that I'm surprised

641
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:17,188
Maze blew up your car.

642
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:19,023
She is...

643
00:24:19,025 --> 00:24:20,257
Maze.

644
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:21,392
I know, right?

645
00:24:21,394 --> 00:24:23,227
Slightest provocation,

646
00:24:23,229 --> 00:24:25,196
and she turns into a little...
                        Hellion?

647
00:24:25,198 --> 00:24:27,064
Exactly.

648
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:28,399
Let me ask you though...

649
00:24:28,401 --> 00:24:31,502
Why do you think
     that she reacted so...

650
00:24:31,504 --> 00:24:33,137
passionately?

651
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:35,840
Because she's a complete maniac
  fueled by rage and violence.

652
00:24:35,842 --> 00:24:39,743
Now, as your friend,
     not your... therapist,

653
00:24:39,745 --> 00:24:43,380
you feel you did
  nothing at all to anger her?

654
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:45,282
Well, s...

655
00:24:45,284 --> 00:24:47,518
Maybe not nothing.

656
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,387
I may have obscured
        the truth a bit.

657
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:52,089
Otherwise known as lying.
Linda,

658
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:54,758
I had no choice.
  You have to understand that.

659
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,393
Oh, I do. Oh, I do.
  You were... you were dealing

660
00:24:56,395 --> 00:24:58,295
with matters
      of great importance.

661
00:24:58,297 --> 00:25:00,865
So important,
              you feel justified

662
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:02,533
to act any way you see fit.

663
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:05,970
Even if that means hurting
     people you care about.

664
00:25:05,972 --> 00:25:08,372
You "did what you had to do."

665
00:25:09,308 --> 00:25:11,242
(exhales)

666
00:25:11,244 --> 00:25:13,043
That's, uh...

667
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:15,112
that's what I did to you.

668
00:25:16,482 --> 00:25:19,149
I treated Maze the same way
      that I treated you.

669
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:21,285
Yeah, except I'm
               just your friend.

670
00:25:21,287 --> 00:25:23,854
And Maze is...

671
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:26,123
well, more.

672
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:27,791
So, it's way worse.

673
00:25:27,793 --> 00:25:30,261
And as my friend,

674
00:25:30,263 --> 00:25:32,162
your advice is?

675
00:25:32,164 --> 00:25:33,931
Apologize your ass off.

676
00:25:33,933 --> 00:25:35,799
Or next time,
    she might blow that up.

677
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:37,801
(sighs)

678
00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:40,004
MAZE:
  <i> Maybe you don't understand.</i>

679
00:25:40,006 --> 00:25:42,907
Mommy Dearest
tried to kill Chloe.

680
00:25:42,909 --> 00:25:44,942
Oh, I understand. She told me.

681
00:25:44,944 --> 00:25:47,344
She did?
           Yes. We're past that.

682
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:48,546
What I don't understand, though,

683
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:50,814
is how the detective
     can think I'm the one

684
00:25:50,816 --> 00:25:53,584
who leaked
sensitive information to my mum.

685
00:25:53,586 --> 00:25:55,052
How could she?

686
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,087
Yeah, Chloe's the bad guy.

687
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:58,822
Mm.

688
00:25:58,824 --> 00:26:00,891
If only I knew who really gave
     Mom that information.
        (elevator dings)

689
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,497
Right. If only.

690
00:26:06,499 --> 00:26:09,033
Oh! Good. You came.

691
00:26:09,035 --> 00:26:11,068
Yes, he did.

692
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,503
Thanks for coming, Dan.

693
00:26:12,505 --> 00:26:14,104
Anything up lately?

694
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:15,372
I don't know. You tell me.

695
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:17,241
Lucifer called me here.

696
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:19,376
Yes. Well, I was thinking,
as my testimony didn't go

697
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:22,279
quite as planned, that it
might help fix things to prove

698
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:24,315
that Perry was behind
Boris' killing.

699
00:26:24,317 --> 00:26:26,116
Already working on it, man.
Fantastic!

700
00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:27,885
Well then, please tell me you
have some scintillating

701
00:26:27,887 --> 00:26:30,387
cop-speak on how to accomplish
that tiny task.

702
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:33,991
Well, uh, the guy who chopped
Boris's head off had this scar.

703
00:26:33,993 --> 00:26:35,192
It's actually a brand.

704
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:37,127
Signature of the
                Alhambra Triads,

705
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:39,129
they're a Chinese
crime syndicate.

706
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:40,531
Lots of them were
 in the prison that Perry ran.

707
00:26:40,533 --> 00:26:42,600
Triads hate the
                    Russians, so

708
00:26:42,602 --> 00:26:44,401
makes sense to pit them
             against each other.

709
00:26:44,403 --> 00:26:46,870
Yeah. You should definitely
       probe this angle.

710
00:26:46,872 --> 00:26:49,106
Mm.
(sniffles)

711
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:51,875
Rumors are they use a Chinese
  cultural center as a front.

712
00:26:51,877 --> 00:26:54,278
Right. Well, let's start
there then, shall we?

713
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,146
DAN:
           <i> These guys</i>

714
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:57,381
are notoriously violent,
so let's try to get

715
00:26:57,383 --> 00:26:58,949
in and out as quickly
as possible, all right?

716
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,351
Oh, speaking
        of "in and out,"

717
00:27:00,353 --> 00:27:03,520
this case really seems
to be touching you, Dan.

718
00:27:03,522 --> 00:27:05,489
You know,
in a very personal way.

719
00:27:05,491 --> 00:27:07,558
All right. Shh. Yeah.
       It's personal, obviously.

720
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,093
Just try to keep it
                down, all right?

721
00:27:09,095 --> 00:27:10,661
Well, it's almost
like you want to take

722
00:27:10,663 --> 00:27:12,663
Charlotte Richards
down yourself.

723
00:27:12,665 --> 00:27:16,033
Like, way down,
and give her a hard time.

724
00:27:16,035 --> 00:27:17,267
What are you trying
to say, Maze?

725
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:18,936
Yes, what are you
               driving at, Maze?

726
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:20,004
"Driving at."

727
00:27:20,006 --> 00:27:21,171
Good one.

728
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:22,506
N-No. I'm just...

729
00:27:22,508 --> 00:27:27,011
really impressed with
how much Dan wants to penetrate

730
00:27:27,013 --> 00:27:28,912
this thing from every

731
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:30,280
position.

732
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:32,049
You know?

733
00:27:32,051 --> 00:27:34,118
Oh, yeah.
           Know what?

734
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,020
I bet that's what she said,
didn't she? (titters)

735
00:27:36,022 --> 00:27:37,988
Oh, yeah!

736
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,457
Oh, Dan!

737
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:41,925
Big boy.
                     (growling):
           All right, all right!

738
00:27:41,927 --> 00:27:43,494
Fine.

739
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:45,696
Yes. It's my fault.

740
00:27:45,698 --> 00:27:48,032
I leaked the information
         to Charlotte.

741
00:27:48,034 --> 00:27:49,333
Among other things.

742
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:51,335
I'm why she knew Chloe
    was first at the scene.

743
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:54,471
She must have looked at my
       text messages after we...

744
00:27:54,473 --> 00:27:55,472
You what?

745
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:57,341
Made... love.

746
00:27:57,343 --> 00:27:59,777
You slept with my... M-arlotte?

747
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:02,479
You bastard!

748
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:04,048
Whoa!

749
00:28:05,151 --> 00:28:07,217
(grunting)

750
00:28:08,154 --> 00:28:10,354
(guns clicking)

751
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:11,555
Oh, now look what you've done.

752
00:28:11,557 --> 00:28:13,390
Wha--?

753
00:28:18,631 --> 00:28:21,131
Da-da... Don't be a Dan.

754
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:23,167
I'll deal with this.

755
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:24,268
Right.

756
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,236
Which one of you chaps
         is in charge?

757
00:28:27,273 --> 00:28:29,273
Oh, very well.

758
00:28:29,275 --> 00:28:31,642
(speaks in Chinese)

759
00:28:31,644 --> 00:28:33,243
DAN:
You speak Chinese?

760
00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:34,945
What...?
                  I'm the Devil.

761
00:28:34,947 --> 00:28:36,480
Of course I speak Chinese.
             I speak everything.

762
00:28:40,986 --> 00:28:43,187
(continues speaking in Chinese)

763
00:28:43,189 --> 00:28:44,788
...Lucifer Morningstar.

764
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:48,692
(continues speaking in Chinese)

765
00:28:48,694 --> 00:28:51,195
(speaks in Chinese)

766
00:28:52,164 --> 00:28:54,231
Lovely.

767
00:28:56,335 --> 00:28:58,402
Furen Li Chunhua.

768
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:01,271
(Lucifer speaking in Chinese)

769
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:02,673
...Daniel.

770
00:29:02,675 --> 00:29:04,007
What's he saying over there?

771
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:05,209
No idea.

772
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:07,711
<i>Xie xie.</i>

773
00:29:07,713 --> 00:29:11,081
Okeydokes. I think
   I've brokered a fair deal.

774
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,350
Madame Li is gonna give us
   the man who killed Boris.

775
00:29:13,352 --> 00:29:15,219
All we have to do
        is defeat Kang.

776
00:29:15,221 --> 00:29:16,787
And who the hell is Kang?

777
00:29:19,225 --> 00:29:21,692
¶ ¶

778
00:29:21,694 --> 00:29:23,994
(laughing)

779
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:25,462
(chuckles)

780
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:28,332
And who's supposed to fight him?
           (chuckles)

781
00:29:28,334 --> 00:29:29,800
Aww, hell no.
                         No, no.

782
00:29:29,802 --> 00:29:32,236
Much as I'd like to see
<i>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Douche,</i>

783
00:29:32,238 --> 00:29:34,371
I'd actually like to win this.
         I was pointing at Maze.

784
00:29:34,373 --> 00:29:35,739
(scoffs, grunts)

785
00:29:35,741 --> 00:29:36,840
Why not?

786
00:29:36,842 --> 00:29:38,876
Okay, sure.

787
00:29:38,878 --> 00:29:40,144
She's terrifying.

788
00:29:40,146 --> 00:29:41,311
But what happens if we lose?

789
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:42,479
They kill us.

790
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:43,480
Well, you.

791
00:29:43,482 --> 00:29:44,982
'Cause I'm immortal.

792
00:29:44,984 --> 00:29:46,116
Right. Shall we?

793
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:47,484
(punches)

794
00:29:47,486 --> 00:29:49,553
¶ ¶

795
00:29:50,723 --> 00:29:52,055
Choose your weapon.

796
00:29:52,057 --> 00:29:53,557
I choose those.

797
00:30:00,366 --> 00:30:02,399
You done?

798
00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:05,269
(punches, screams)

799
00:30:05,271 --> 00:30:07,371
(grunts)

800
00:30:07,373 --> 00:30:09,373
¶ I'm deep, I'm deep ¶

801
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:12,843
¶ Deeper in the situation
that I ever thought I would be ¶

802
00:30:12,845 --> 00:30:15,345
¶ I be ¶

803
00:30:15,347 --> 00:30:17,815
¶ I see, I see ¶

804
00:30:17,817 --> 00:30:22,019
¶ My reflection is going,
 this river is flowing on me ¶

805
00:30:24,824 --> 00:30:26,356
¶ It's raining ¶

806
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:28,492
¶ She's playing ¶

807
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:30,494
¶ I feel it from below
          and I know ¶

808
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:33,163
¶ The Devil's got a hold on me ¶
              Ooh!

809
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:34,264
Hoo-ah.

810
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,439
She likes that move.

811
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:44,308
¶ The toll it's taking ¶

812
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,176
¶ It's raining ¶

813
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:48,445
¶ She's playing ¶

814
00:30:48,447 --> 00:30:51,381
¶ I've done it once
     and I'll do it again ¶

815
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:54,084
¶ The Devil's got a hold on me ¶

816
00:30:55,054 --> 00:30:56,386
(Kang exclaims)

817
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:58,188
¶ Oh, on me ¶

818
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,623
(crunches)

819
00:31:03,262 --> 00:31:04,461
(wolf whistles)

820
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:05,462
Down, girl.

821
00:31:05,464 --> 00:31:07,064
Are you serious?
                           Well,

822
00:31:07,066 --> 00:31:08,866
I mean, you did
       get two new toys.

823
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:14,805
Well, that sucked.

824
00:31:14,807 --> 00:31:15,973
Hmm?

825
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:18,342
But a deal's a deal.

826
00:31:18,344 --> 00:31:20,277
Indeed.
The one you seek

827
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:22,946
was banished for working
      outside the family.

828
00:31:22,948 --> 00:31:25,015
We don't break bread
with strangers.

829
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:28,619
You'll find him at this address.

830
00:31:30,956 --> 00:31:32,089
<i> Xie Xie.</i>

831
00:31:32,091 --> 00:31:33,957
No problem.
           (exhales)

832
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:37,494
See? Easy peasy, Chinese-y.

833
00:31:38,464 --> 00:31:40,197
CHLOE:
        <i> Dan's got a lead</i>

834
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:42,499
on Boris' killer,
and it may implicate Perry.

835
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:44,835
So, if he is responsible,
it might not matter

836
00:31:44,837 --> 00:31:46,837
what happens in this trial.
                       (exhales)

837
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:48,872
Well, that's great, 'cause we
   are getting our asses kicked.

838
00:31:48,874 --> 00:31:50,240
Well. I have to testify next.

839
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:51,875
I just hope
I don't make things worse.

840
00:31:51,877 --> 00:31:53,377
Oh, you'll do great, honey.
                   You're a pro.

841
00:31:53,379 --> 00:31:55,846
Right, Mom. A real pro.

842
00:31:55,848 --> 00:31:57,114
Like when I followed
the prison van.

843
00:31:57,116 --> 00:32:00,083
Mom, what if I'm the reason
Dad's killer goes free?

844
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:01,251
Don't you dare.

845
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:03,453
No father in the world was
      more proud of his daughter

846
00:32:03,455 --> 00:32:04,521
than your dad.

847
00:32:04,523 --> 00:32:07,057
And nothing you could do
       in that courtroom

848
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:09,259
or anywhere
     will ever change that.

849
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:10,861
(footsteps)

850
00:32:10,863 --> 00:32:12,863
I just miss him.

851
00:32:12,865 --> 00:32:15,632
I want him to get
    the justice he deserves.

852
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:18,268
Justice is what
we all want, dear.

853
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,137
For your father,

854
00:32:20,139 --> 00:32:21,672
and for my client.

855
00:32:25,477 --> 00:32:26,643
You're a mother.

856
00:32:26,645 --> 00:32:28,011
Aren't you?

857
00:32:28,013 --> 00:32:29,112
Yes.

858
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:31,181
Then shame on you.

859
00:32:36,555 --> 00:32:39,323
We need to talk.

860
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:45,562
Man, he better be here.

861
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:47,130
If we can convince him
to give up Perry,

862
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,967
I won't feel so bad about
having slept with Charl...

863
00:32:49,969 --> 00:32:51,401
La la la la!
                    No more talk

864
00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:53,570
of that disgusting
                offense, please.

865
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:56,506
I thought you said
   you hadn't slept with her.

866
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:59,343
I haven't,
                  wouldn't ever.

867
00:32:59,345 --> 00:33:00,978
I'm just upset
              for the detective.

868
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,045
What, you think I'm not?

869
00:33:02,047 --> 00:33:03,313
I would do anything
to right this.

870
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,382
(sighs):
               I know you would.

871
00:33:11,557 --> 00:33:14,591
LAPD! Put your hands
      where I can see 'em!

872
00:33:18,998 --> 00:33:20,063
Whoa!

873
00:33:22,067 --> 00:33:24,534
Well, looks like
        we found Boris,

874
00:33:24,536 --> 00:33:26,336
at the head
   of the table, ironically.

875
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:29,206
And that's Da Young.
          I'd say we were right.

876
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:31,108
Perry hired him to go
         behind the Triad's back

877
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:33,343
to kill Boris, knowing that
       they'd punish him for it.

878
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:36,079
Clever Perry, killed two birds
        with one stone.

879
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:38,348
Three, if you count
          the chicken.

880
00:33:42,955 --> 00:33:43,920
CHLOE:
   <i> You've got a lot of nerve.</i>

881
00:33:43,922 --> 00:33:45,689
Yes, I've been told.

882
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:46,823
And legs for days.

883
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:49,426
Now, listen,
              you're losing bad.

884
00:33:49,428 --> 00:33:50,927
Without Boris, the
          prosecution's evidence

885
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:52,529
is mostly circumstantial.

886
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:53,930
And, unfortunately for you,

887
00:33:53,932 --> 00:33:55,565
Lucifer's testimony
             basically handed me

888
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:57,000
a non-guilty verdict.

889
00:33:57,002 --> 00:33:58,935
This trial is over.

890
00:33:58,937 --> 00:34:00,804
Maybe.

891
00:34:00,806 --> 00:34:03,440
But the investigation
       into that monster

892
00:34:03,442 --> 00:34:05,909
that you call a client
          is ongoing.

893
00:34:05,911 --> 00:34:07,511
So one way or another,

894
00:34:07,513 --> 00:34:10,113
he wi--
       (cell phone rings)

895
00:34:10,115 --> 00:34:11,915
Hmm.

896
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:12,949
Bad news?

897
00:34:13,952 --> 00:34:15,552
I may have a solution.

898
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:20,123
My client isn't fully
            aware we're winning.

899
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:21,725
However, he is
                 more than aware

900
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:23,060
that he's facing
              the death penalty.

901
00:34:23,062 --> 00:34:26,096
And we both know
                  he's a coward.

902
00:34:26,098 --> 00:34:27,931
I could use
                 the possibility

903
00:34:27,933 --> 00:34:30,734
of a lethal injection
     to get him to plead guilty.

904
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:31,835
You're supposed to be
          on his side.

905
00:34:31,837 --> 00:34:32,836
Why are you doing this?

906
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:35,172
Well, there is one condition.

907
00:34:35,174 --> 00:34:36,907
You'd have to betray Lucifer.

908
00:34:38,944 --> 00:34:40,577
So...

909
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:43,146
you want Perry to go to jail,

910
00:34:43,148 --> 00:34:45,082
call Lucifer a liar.

911
00:34:45,084 --> 00:34:47,150
"A liar"?

912
00:34:47,152 --> 00:34:51,021
If there's one thing he cares
   about more than anything,

913
00:34:51,023 --> 00:34:53,690
it's his honor.

914
00:34:54,993 --> 00:34:56,293
See you in court.

915
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,496
(clears her throat)

916
00:34:59,498 --> 00:35:00,697
MOM:
       <i> Detective Decker,</i>

917
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:02,499
Lucifer Morningstar
   is your partner, correct?

918
00:35:02,501 --> 00:35:03,834
Yes.

919
00:35:03,836 --> 00:35:06,903
He's a civilian
        consultant for the LAPD.

920
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:08,038
We work cases together.

921
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,173
And how is he qualified
         for this role?

922
00:35:10,175 --> 00:35:13,977
He is very, uh, intuitive.

923
00:35:13,979 --> 00:35:17,047
He, um, understands
       people's desires.

924
00:35:17,049 --> 00:35:18,715
MOM: And in
               addition to that,

925
00:35:18,717 --> 00:35:20,250
I assume he studied
        law enforcement?

926
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:24,654
Not to my knowledge, no.

927
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:26,923
MOM:
Oh, okay.

928
00:35:26,925 --> 00:35:28,191
But he has
   a professional background,

929
00:35:28,193 --> 00:35:30,527
which is somehow relevant
      to law enforcement?

930
00:35:30,529 --> 00:35:31,661
He owns a nightclub.

931
00:35:31,663 --> 00:35:33,563
MOM:
                 Okay, but then,

932
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:34,931
I'm sure his previous job

933
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:36,199
was more relevant to his role

934
00:35:36,201 --> 00:35:38,135
as a civilian consultant
         for the LAPD?

935
00:35:38,137 --> 00:35:40,070
Right?
              Mm.

936
00:35:40,072 --> 00:35:42,539
Well, if you
              believe his claims

937
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:44,040
that he used to run Hell...

938
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:47,177
(chokes, clears throat)

939
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:51,181
...then yes, he's accustomed
     to punishing bad guys.

940
00:35:51,183 --> 00:35:52,649
(muffled murmurs)

941
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:53,884
It's true.

942
00:35:53,886 --> 00:35:55,652
I'm confused, Detective.

943
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:59,556
Are you suggesting your
     partner is delusional,

944
00:35:59,558 --> 00:36:00,991
or just lying?

945
00:36:05,864 --> 00:36:09,933
Lucifer Morningstar
        is many things,

946
00:36:09,935 --> 00:36:12,202
but he is not a liar.

947
00:36:12,204 --> 00:36:15,972
Everything that
            Mr. Morningstar said

948
00:36:15,974 --> 00:36:18,642
on this stand is
                absolutely true.

949
00:36:18,644 --> 00:36:21,645
I was the first person
on that crime scene.

950
00:36:21,647 --> 00:36:24,214
And, yes, I shouldn't
  have been anywhere near it.

951
00:36:24,216 --> 00:36:27,083
But I...

952
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:29,886
let my emotions

953
00:36:29,888 --> 00:36:31,988
get the best of me.

954
00:36:34,226 --> 00:36:36,760
(clears her throat)

955
00:36:36,762 --> 00:36:38,228
Lucifer is the...

956
00:36:40,332 --> 00:36:42,866
...best partner

957
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:44,868
I have ever had.

958
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:49,206
And I can only hope that
              he can count on me

959
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:53,243
as much as I count on him.

960
00:36:53,245 --> 00:36:55,011
STEDMAN: Your Honor, we request
     the jury be instructed

961
00:36:55,013 --> 00:36:58,748
to disregard Detective Decker's
       entire testimony.

962
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:01,084
We'll take a ten-minute recess.

963
00:37:17,135 --> 00:37:18,301
(overlapping reporter chatter)

964
00:37:18,303 --> 00:37:19,336
REPORTER: Harry,
       are you surprised

965
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:20,770
by that "not guilty" verdict?

966
00:37:20,772 --> 00:37:22,806
No. I'm never surprised
to see justice served.

967
00:37:22,808 --> 00:37:24,274
I believe in our
legal system.

968
00:37:24,276 --> 00:37:25,809
And now I can finally
             return to my family

969
00:37:25,811 --> 00:37:27,377
a free man, so,
            if you'll excuse me.

970
00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:28,979
(cameras clicking)

971
00:37:28,981 --> 00:37:32,382
(reporters calling for Chloe)

972
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:37,287
(seagulls squawking)

973
00:37:55,307 --> 00:37:58,041
I'm sorry to bother you,
um, I was, um...

974
00:37:58,043 --> 00:38:00,277
I'm looking for Maze.

975
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:01,678
Do you know what apartment
she lives in?

976
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,914
Oh, yes, but
                 she's not home.

977
00:38:06,418 --> 00:38:08,351
Why, did you get
                     in a fight?

978
00:38:08,353 --> 00:38:10,420
(laughs)

979
00:38:10,422 --> 00:38:11,788
I'm sorry, it's
            none of my business.

980
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:16,693
It's just, my husband...

981
00:38:16,695 --> 00:38:19,229
always gave me flowers
              after an argument.

982
00:38:19,231 --> 00:38:22,198
Are you all right?
                         (sighs)

983
00:38:30,709 --> 00:38:32,842
I used to believe

984
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:34,911
everything happens
                   for a reason.

985
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:38,014
But now,
                I'm not so sure.

986
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:39,749
(chuckles)

987
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:40,984
Me, neither.

988
00:38:42,454 --> 00:38:45,388
But I do know that
no matter how bad things get,

989
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:48,191
the true test is
how we choose to respond

990
00:38:48,193 --> 00:38:51,428
to the pain we suffer.

991
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:53,263
Or inflict.

992
00:38:53,265 --> 00:38:55,932
That's well said.

993
00:38:55,934 --> 00:38:57,901
Maze is a lucky girl.

994
00:38:59,471 --> 00:39:01,271
Hope she forgives you.

995
00:39:01,273 --> 00:39:03,973
Ha! Huh.

996
00:39:07,379 --> 00:39:10,980
I'm sorry, you...
       you look really familiar.

997
00:39:10,982 --> 00:39:13,149
I'm Chloe's mom?

998
00:39:13,151 --> 00:39:14,517
Have we met?

999
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:21,024
No, I don't believe we have.

1000
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:23,226
I never forget a face.

1001
00:39:26,898 --> 00:39:29,299
If you'll excuse me,
I have to go.

1002
00:39:29,301 --> 00:39:31,067
Oh.

1003
00:39:32,904 --> 00:39:35,872
¶ ¶

1004
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:39,409
¶ Nowhere to run
      nowhere to hide... ¶

1005
00:39:39,411 --> 00:39:40,944
¶ I'm the one... ¶

1006
00:39:40,946 --> 00:39:42,946
Good night, Rosie.

1007
00:39:42,948 --> 00:39:45,915
¶ Into the dark
     and outta the light ¶

1008
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:48,785
¶ I'm the one who
    goes bump in the night ¶

1009
00:39:48,787 --> 00:39:50,420
¶ ¶

1010
00:39:50,422 --> 00:39:51,855
Perry Smith.

1011
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:56,559
I know you had
Boris killed.

1012
00:39:58,063 --> 00:39:59,829
I also know
you're responsible

1013
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:01,898
for the murder
of Jill Fields

1014
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,133
and John Decker.

1015
00:40:03,135 --> 00:40:06,436
Aw, such a shame there's
             no evidence, right?

1016
00:40:06,438 --> 00:40:09,339
The system kind of needs proof.

1017
00:40:09,341 --> 00:40:11,474
Yeah.

1018
00:40:11,476 --> 00:40:14,077
You clean your mess,
          we got nada.

1019
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,312
But you know who's
okay with nada?

1020
00:40:16,314 --> 00:40:18,148
Or shall I say<i> nichego?</i>

1021
00:40:19,885 --> 00:40:21,017
Yeah, that's right.

1022
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:22,886
You see, the Russians,

1023
00:40:22,888 --> 00:40:24,254
they don't like it
     when one of their own

1024
00:40:24,256 --> 00:40:26,956
is taken out
      without permission.

1025
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:28,992
But who knows?

1026
00:40:28,994 --> 00:40:30,493
Maybe they won't hear about it.

1027
00:40:37,235 --> 00:40:38,368
Whoa.

1028
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:40,270
Aah!
       (muffled shouting)

1029
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,007
My pleasure, Meesha.

1030
00:40:44,009 --> 00:40:45,575
<i> Dozvidanya.</i>

1031
00:40:53,218 --> 00:40:54,851
(tires screeching)

1032
00:40:54,853 --> 00:40:58,087
¶ I'm the one that goes
     bump in the night... ¶

1033
00:40:58,089 --> 00:40:59,622
I didn't think
              you had it in you.

1034
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:02,325
I'm impressed.

1035
00:41:02,327 --> 00:41:03,493
Drive.

1036
00:41:03,495 --> 00:41:04,861
¶ That goes bump in the night ¶

1037
00:41:04,863 --> 00:41:07,397
¶ I'm the one, I'm the one ¶

1038
00:41:07,399 --> 00:41:08,965
¶ I'm the one ¶

1039
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:11,601
¶ I'm the one and only one. ¶

1040
00:41:27,385 --> 00:41:30,019
You were right.

1041
00:41:30,021 --> 00:41:32,522
You are nothing like Father.

1042
00:41:32,524 --> 00:41:36,159
Oh? What changed
                      your mind?

1043
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:37,994
If I tell you this,
                you have to come

1044
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:39,529
completely clean
                with me, Mother.

1045
00:41:39,531 --> 00:41:43,032
No more secrets, Mom.
No more lies.

1046
00:41:45,303 --> 00:41:47,203
Okay.

1047
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,240
What happened?

1048
00:41:50,242 --> 00:41:54,043
35 years ago, Father,

1049
00:41:54,045 --> 00:41:55,245
He asked me
to come down here

1050
00:41:55,247 --> 00:41:57,447
to bless a couple who was
unable to have a child.

1051
00:41:57,449 --> 00:41:59,916
He had never asked me
to do anything of this sort,

1052
00:41:59,918 --> 00:42:02,485
and He never did again.

1053
00:42:02,487 --> 00:42:03,720
Today...

1054
00:42:05,357 --> 00:42:07,290
I met the mother again.

1055
00:42:09,327 --> 00:42:11,361
And I found out what the result

1056
00:42:11,363 --> 00:42:13,162
of that miracle was.

1057
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:16,666
Or, rather, who.

1058
00:42:16,668 --> 00:42:18,568
(elevator bell dings)

1059
00:42:19,638 --> 00:42:22,038
Oh, hey.
                      Detective.

1060
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,207
Sorry, I thought...
        What are you doing here?

1061
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:25,942
Are you on your way out?

1062
00:42:25,944 --> 00:42:27,577
I am, yes.

1063
00:42:27,579 --> 00:42:29,078
Oh...
           To see you, actually.

1064
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,347
Oh.

1065
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:34,484
I believe I owe you dinner.

1066
00:42:34,486 --> 00:42:38,621
MOM:
        <i> Now we know why</i>
      <i> Chloe's so special.</i>

1067
00:42:38,623 --> 00:42:41,291
Don't we?

1068
00:42:41,293 --> 00:42:43,626
Your Father put her here.

1069
00:42:43,628 --> 00:42:45,595
In Lucifer's path.

1070
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:49,299
You know what this means?

1071
00:42:49,301 --> 00:42:53,369
It means...
       that I was a pawn.

1072
00:42:53,371 --> 00:42:56,739
¶ Can you feel it
  coming in the air tonight ¶

1073
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:58,007
Say when.

1074
00:42:58,009 --> 00:42:59,242
When!
           (laughter)

1075
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:00,710
When.

1076
00:43:00,712 --> 00:43:02,245
I hope you know
it takes months

1077
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:03,379
to get a reservation
at this place.

1078
00:43:03,381 --> 00:43:05,515
Oh, yeah.
          The fries are amazing.

1079
00:43:05,517 --> 00:43:07,383
Oh, thank you.
I made them myself.

1080
00:43:10,655 --> 00:43:12,488
It means Chloe's
                not an obstacle.

1081
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:15,525
She's how you'll
            get your wings back.

1082
00:43:15,527 --> 00:43:18,528
She's how we'll
               get it all back.

1083
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:21,130
¶ But I don't know
        if you know... ¶

1084
00:43:21,132 --> 00:43:23,666
Detective?

1085
00:43:23,668 --> 00:43:27,337
What you said
today in the courtroom...

1086
00:43:27,339 --> 00:43:29,072
It was the truth.

1087
00:43:29,074 --> 00:43:32,375
¶ In the air tonight ¶

1088
00:43:32,377 --> 00:43:34,210
¶ Oh, Lord ¶

1089
00:43:35,547 --> 00:43:38,648
¶ I've been waiting
       for this moment ¶

1090
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:41,517
We're going home, son.

1091
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:45,555
And Chloe is the Key.

1092
00:43:45,557 --> 00:43:48,791
¶ I can feel it coming ¶

1093
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:52,462
¶ In the air tonight ¶

1094
00:43:52,464 --> 00:43:53,696
¶ Oh, Lord. ¶
