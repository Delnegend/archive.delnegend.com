00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:04,841
<i> Previously on</i> Lucifer...
<i> Someone's escaped from Hell.</i>

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:07,039
Who escaped Hell?
LUCIFER:<i> Mom.</i>

3
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:08,271
If she's not coming to kill me,

4
00:00:08,275 --> 00:00:10,605
<i> then I don't know</i>
<i> what she's doing.</i>

5
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:11,741
Aren't you glad
to see me?

6
00:00:11,746 --> 00:00:13,406
I apologize for
my human form.

7
00:00:13,414 --> 00:00:14,484
Chloe, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,482 --> 00:00:16,322
You don't get to be sorry.

9
00:00:16,317 --> 00:00:17,447
DAN:
<i> I've been demoted.</i>

10
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:18,881
<i> I'm reassigned</i>
<i> to assist on cases.</i>

11
00:00:18,886 --> 00:00:20,946
MAZE:<i> I need to figure out</i>
<i> where I fit in in this world.</i>

12
00:00:20,955 --> 00:00:22,215
I need some space.

13
00:00:22,223 --> 00:00:24,223
AMENADIEL:<i> Things have been</i>
<i> very trying for me.</i>

14
00:00:24,225 --> 00:00:25,415
(yelling)
MAZE:<i> Lucifer made a deal with</i>

15
00:00:25,426 --> 00:00:26,886
your ex to take
you back to Hell.

16
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:28,394
<i> And he doesn't break deals.</i>

17
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:30,096
I want what your father
took from me.

18
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:31,327
All right, you can stay,

19
00:00:31,332 --> 00:00:34,002
just until I figure out
what I need to do.

20
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:38,971
Â¶ I-I... can get
used to this... Â¶

21
00:00:38,973 --> 00:00:42,373
MAN:
<i> I want to say I'm sorry...</i>

22
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:44,406
<i> for all my sins.</i>

23
00:00:44,412 --> 00:00:48,452
For anything I have ever done
that hurt people.

24
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:51,919
I was stupid.

25
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:54,919
And I am sorry.

26
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:58,122
I am so sorry.

27
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:03,027
(crying softly)

28
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,960
All I want now is forgiveness.

29
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:11,365
I just want to take it all back.

30
00:01:11,372 --> 00:01:12,502
Please.

31
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:13,536
(lighter clicks)

32
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:15,111
No! Just let me take it back!

33
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:18,439
No, no, no, no! No...!

34
00:01:18,446 --> 00:01:19,706
(woman squealing)

35
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:20,713
(chuckling)

36
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:23,284
(moaning)

37
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,190
There's no need
for squeals.

38
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:30,619
We'll stop this torture
any time you like.

39
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,624
Just say the word.

40
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:34,626
Don't you dare stop.

41
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:36,798
(chuckles)

42
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:39,927
MOM:
What happens if he stops?

43
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:41,704
Well, Lucifer,
don't be shy.

44
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:43,042
Introduce me
to your friend.

45
00:01:43,037 --> 00:01:44,997
Lucifer,
you brought a surprise.

46
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:47,165
I most certainly did not bring
any surprises.

47
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:48,644
Oh, she's beautiful.

48
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:49,712
LUCIFER:
That's my mum

49
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,040
you're talking about.

50
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:56,551
This just got too weird.

51
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,950
(elevator bell dings)

52
00:02:03,057 --> 00:02:04,517
Listen, Mum,
I know I chose

53
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:07,025
not to return you to Hell,
yet...

54
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:08,487
Which I appreciate.
But that doesn't mean

55
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:11,726
you can just waltz in here
and accost my guests.

56
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:13,522
I apologize.

57
00:02:13,516 --> 00:02:15,296
It's just that all
these human rules

58
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:18,002
and customs are
so confusing.

59
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:21,105
Remember, I'm still getting
used to this earthly skin sack.

60
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:23,008
Yes, yes, you used
to be a goddess.

61
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,880
I know, but things
are different now.

62
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,249
And I will figure it out.

63
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:28,407
Now that we're
together again,

64
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:30,045
I just want to be
part of your lives.

65
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,680
Not this part!

66
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,390
Out of bounds.

67
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:38,957
Wait. What do you
mean by "lives"?

68
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:41,687
I want to see Amenadiel.

69
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:43,955
(laughs):
What?

70
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:45,934
It's time.

71
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:48,533
I am not
going to live

72
00:02:48,536 --> 00:02:50,396
in fear of my own son.

73
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:52,174
We may have had
our differences...

74
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:54,113
He literally
carried you to Hell.

75
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:55,438
But I created him.

76
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,612
Certainly that has to
count for something.

77
00:02:57,611 --> 00:02:59,111
It doesn't. Bummer, right?

78
00:02:59,113 --> 00:03:00,283
One look at you,
and he'll take you

79
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:01,481
right back where you came from.

80
00:03:01,482 --> 00:03:04,582
I'm surprised he hasn't
come sniffing around already.

81
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:07,245
Well, what am I supposed to do,
just sit here and hide?

82
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,394
See a movie, go to a museum.

83
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,190
Catch up on what's happened over
the past few thousand years.

84
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:13,933
You'd be surprised.

85
00:03:13,928 --> 00:03:15,128
Yes. I suppose
a lot has changed.

86
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:16,559
I mean, who would've predicted
you would've

87
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:18,334
taken on this human job?

88
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:21,102
I'm a punisher, Mother.
It's what I've always done.

89
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:23,471
The only thing that changed
was the locale.

90
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,470
(scoffs)

91
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:32,378
I know what you're thinking,

92
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,549
but I was assisting on a
stakeout that went long,

93
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,918
and I'm really sorry,
but I promise you,

94
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:38,677
I will make it
up to you, okay?

95
00:03:38,686 --> 00:03:41,216
How?

96
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:46,286
Double fudge, your favorite.

97
00:03:47,962 --> 00:03:50,162
You're lucky I like you.

98
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,400
(sighs)

99
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,631
Hey.

100
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:56,836
Hey.

101
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:58,967
Thank you for letting me
do the pickup here at work.

102
00:03:58,973 --> 00:04:01,743
I've just been running around
a lot since the demotion.

103
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,182
You know, helping out

104
00:04:03,177 --> 00:04:04,337
on everyone else's cases.

105
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:06,245
Yeah. It's fine, it's fine.

106
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:08,677
Are we still going
on our family camping trip?

107
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:11,232
Oh, uh...

108
00:04:11,234 --> 00:04:13,794
We're still ler... working
out the logistics of that.

109
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:15,787
Of the trip.

110
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:18,788
(clears throat)

111
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:20,992
Look, I know that
you're still mad at me.

112
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:22,825
I deserve it.

113
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:26,160
But this stuff between us is
starting to affect Trixie.

114
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,666
So I think that we
need to talk later.

115
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:30,369
(phone ringing)

116
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:32,601
Yeah, yeah. We should.

117
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:33,666
You're right.

118
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:34,914
Uh, Decker.

119
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:37,608
Okay, yeah.
Two seconds.

120
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,880
MAN:
<i> I was stupid.</i>

121
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:44,653
And I'm sorry.

122
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:46,652
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

123
00:04:46,654 --> 00:04:48,824
Victim's name was
Nicholas Sands, 35.

124
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:52,022
Worked as an exec at the
Internet startup called Wobble.

125
00:04:52,026 --> 00:04:53,756
Wobble?

126
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:55,931
Please tell me that's
a pornography site.

127
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:58,999
Oh, no, no. Wobble's like
a next gen Facebook, you know?

128
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:00,999
People post updates,
photos, links.

129
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:03,071
Mine's mostly slo-mo videos
of me doing cannonballs

130
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,070
onto inflatable pool toys.

131
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:06,441
You should check it out.

132
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,710
I'll pass, but thank you.

133
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:10,639
Nick's confession was posted
to his Wobble account

134
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,044
six hours ago,
right around the time of death.

135
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:15,906
Which means whoever did this
wanted us to find that video.

136
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,816
So we could see how weepy
this chap was before he died.

137
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,619
Now, that is cruel.

138
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:23,161
Ella, do we know
how the fire started?

139
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:24,717
Any chemicals
we can trace?

140
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:27,385
So far, all we've got
is paraffin oil.

141
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:30,264
Which is highly flammable,
but also, like, everywhere.

142
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:33,274
Even in crayons, so
color at your own risk.

143
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:35,367
Doesn't help us
narrow the suspects.

144
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:36,599
Yeah, but this might.

145
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:38,303
Okay, so based
on the burn pattern,

146
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:40,465
which is pretty gnarly
in this case,

147
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:43,014
it looks like the highest
concentration of accelerant

148
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,680
was placed, well...

149
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,138
here.

150
00:05:49,283 --> 00:05:51,623
LUCIFER:
Goodness gracious,

151
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:52,648
great balls of fire.

152
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:54,153
Lucifer.
I mean, I've heard
of hot pants,

153
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:55,494
but this really
brings new meaning

154
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:57,359
to the term "fire
crotch," doesn't it?
Lucifer.

155
00:05:57,358 --> 00:05:58,658
Wait. I have more.

156
00:05:58,659 --> 00:05:59,689
Smokey Bobinson.

157
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:00,993
Weekend at Burnie's.

158
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:02,034
His burning bush?

159
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,199
Oh. Very good.
(chuckles)

160
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:06,198
That was actually me,
by the way,

161
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,830
so don't tell anyone.
CHLOE: Hey, guys?

162
00:06:07,835 --> 00:06:09,125
Dead body.

163
00:06:09,136 --> 00:06:10,796
Can you please
take this seriously?

164
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:13,714
I assure you, Detective,
I'm taking this very seriously.

165
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:14,767
Look at this.

166
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:17,435
Our killer was clearly
punishing his victim.

167
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:20,106
And?

168
00:06:20,114 --> 00:06:22,114
And punishing is my job.

169
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:23,416
So if there's
someone out there

170
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:25,577
stealing my jam,
I need to find out who.

171
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:30,624
It's game bloody on.

172
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:32,624
Â¶ Â¶

173
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:43,401
CHLOE: Do not touch
the charred crotch.

174
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,108
Is a sentence I never
thought I'd say out loud.

175
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:49,267
It's vicious work.

176
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:51,076
I mean, I reserve
this kind of treatment

177
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:53,408
for the truly terrible
in Hell.

178
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:55,084
Pedophiles, Nazis.

179
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:57,082
People who put their
seats back on a plane.

180
00:06:57,084 --> 00:07:00,754
Uh-huh. Seeing as the nature
of the crime is so specific,

181
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,294
we need to figure out
who had a personal grudge

182
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,390
against the victim.
Hmm.

183
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:10,833
Uh, by the way, you've
skipped a spot, there.

184
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:12,331
Oh. (chuckles)

185
00:07:12,332 --> 00:07:13,632
Yeah, it's not like you

186
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:16,104
to miss a step in the
clothing department.

187
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:17,543
Yes, well, I had to rush out
this morning.

188
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:19,368
I've got an unexpected
houseguest I can't get rid of.

189
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:21,843
Oh, right. New lady friend
that you can't shake.

190
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:23,582
A rather old one,
actually.

191
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:28,707
Yeah, I know how...
complicated exes can be.

192
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:30,245
What? She's not an ex.

193
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,020
OFFICER: You should
see this, Detective.

194
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:33,449
Thanks.

195
00:07:33,454 --> 00:07:34,594
What is it?

196
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:37,358
E-mails from Nick's
supervisor at Wobble.

197
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:39,287
A woman by the name
of Leila Simms.

198
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:40,393
Let me guess,
something riveting

199
00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:42,094
about the latest
quarterly report?

200
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:43,085
"How could you?

201
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:44,556
"I should have
known better.

202
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:46,255
You won't get
away with this."

203
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:48,726
"I'll burn you
starting with your man parts"?

204
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,640
No. (sighs)

205
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,108
Still, that's a pretty
good lead.
Yep.

206
00:07:57,444 --> 00:08:00,154
CHLOE:
Do not... touch...

207
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,347
the charred crotch.

208
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:09,088
And Nick was so...
sweet and charming.

209
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:10,619
How could someone do
such a thing?

210
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:12,824
So, Leila, you were
his supervisor.

211
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,786
How well did you
know him?

212
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:16,125
We dated briefly,
a while ago.

213
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:17,329
LUCIFER:
Oh.

214
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,630
(sighs)

215
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:22,374
Would you say
things sort of flamed out,

216
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:23,939
or did they end in more of

217
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:25,167
a blaze of glory?

218
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,772
Lucifer.
You're right, far too subtle.

219
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,943
Why did you torture
the poor young man to death?

220
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:31,182
Torture him?

221
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:34,009
Oh, God.

222
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,014
You think I had
something to do with this?

223
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,646
Well, we know about
the angry e-mails.

224
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:39,051
I was pissed off.

225
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:41,652
He shared pictures
of us together.

226
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:43,115
Mm, mid-coitus?

227
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:44,592
If so, we'll have to
confiscate those immediately.

228
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:45,961
No.

229
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,029
Just of us

230
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,057
at-at dinner.

231
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:49,561
But I'm his boss,

232
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:51,233
and inter-office romance
is frowned upon here.

233
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:52,461
Well, it hardly
seems worthy

234
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:55,126
of lighting a man's
johnson on fire.

235
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,270
Wait.

236
00:08:58,272 --> 00:09:00,142
Is that how he died?

237
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,738
There's something
you should see.

238
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:07,326
(intercom beeps)

239
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:08,810
Ray, can you come in here,
please?

240
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:12,145
Ray, I'm gonna need you
to pull up the video

241
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:14,292
of Tommy at the
company retreat.

242
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:15,818
RAY:
<i> The</i> video of Tommy?

243
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:17,362
Ray's head of our H.R.

244
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:19,117
Being protective is
part of his job.

245
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:20,686
Do it, Ray.

246
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:25,199
Nick was a charmer,
but he had a tendency

247
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:27,168
to be a little harsh
with interns.

248
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:29,467
Aka, he could be a real dick.

249
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:32,374
As you'll see.

250
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:39,284
Aah! Aah!
(laughter)

251
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,209
My balls! Get it off!

252
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:43,854
(laughter continues)

253
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,620
(laughing)

254
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:48,647
Come on,
that is quite funny.

255
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:50,555
LEILA: Nick posted the video
shortly after the retreat,

256
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:52,987
and even though
it was quickly taken down,

257
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:54,163
everyone saw it.

258
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:57,031
Tommy was a
laughingstock.

259
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,430
He quit pretty soon after.

260
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:00,472
Certainly looks like motive.

261
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,109
Huh.

262
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,566
What can you tell me
about Nick Sand's death?

263
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:11,005
Just that the bastard
finally got what he deserved.

264
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:13,681
Okay. And why did
he deserve it?

265
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,180
As soon as I took
the job at Wobble,

266
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:18,083
Nick made it
his personal mission

267
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:20,045
to make my life hell.

268
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:22,353
Sabotaging my work,
terrorizing me,

269
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:24,516
making me the butt
of all of his jokes.

270
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:26,864
Or the<i> balls,</i> in this case?

271
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:29,385
TOMMY:
That stupid video was

272
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:31,356
my breaking point.

273
00:10:31,365 --> 00:10:34,265
Everyone saw it.
Everyone laughed at me!

274
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:36,167
No one's laughing now, Tommy.

275
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:38,769
So after everything
that happened, what,

276
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:41,412
you-you wanted to
make him feel your pain?

277
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:43,438
He deserved
what happened to him.

278
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:45,883
Yeah, but you're not
answering the question.

279
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,824
Did you kill Nick?

280
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,677
LUCIFER: I understand
punishment all too well, Tommy,

281
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:56,286
and Nick deserved
to be punished.

282
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:57,959
He did, didn't he?

283
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,158
LUCIFER: Mm. He took your
dignity, and so you had to

284
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,490
take your revenge.

285
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:05,025
There was no other way to get
your proverbial balls back.

286
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:06,562
So tell me...

287
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,728
...did you desire...

288
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:11,036
I killed him.

289
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:13,268
Oh.

290
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:14,813
Well, that took

291
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:17,278
all the fun out of it.

292
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:20,779
That did not go how I expected.

293
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:23,421
Oh, come now, Detective.
He obviously wanted people

294
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:24,947
to know that he got
his revenge.

295
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:27,151
Now our would-be punisher's
brought to justice,

296
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:30,464
and the field is mine again...

297
00:11:30,457 --> 00:11:33,187
What on earth is she doing here?

298
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,693
CHLOE:
Charlotte Richards.

299
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:36,755
The defense attorney
we saved, remember?

300
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:39,503
She must be back here
defending some scumbag.

301
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:42,599
But why are they
all being so... chummy?

302
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:45,472
CHLOE: Well, she used to be
a cop, and, oh, yeah,

303
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:47,142
'cause she's a knockout.

304
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,470
Personally, I'm surprised
that you haven't tried...

305
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:51,606
Pardon me, pardon me.
Excuse us.

306
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:54,951
Charlotte, hello. Do you mind
if we have a quick word?

307
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:56,818
(chuckles)

308
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:59,617
(quietly): What are you
doing here, Mother?

309
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:01,149
I thought we agreed
you'd do something constructive

310
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:03,824
with your time, like
mall walking or a studio tour,

311
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:05,224
perhaps, but...

312
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,085
How did you even find
your way here?

313
00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:08,664
Well, it wasn't difficult.

314
00:12:08,662 --> 00:12:12,262
I simply smiled at a male human
and asked him to take me.

315
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:14,725
Need I remind you that Charlotte
Richards has a husband out there

316
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:16,695
who's wondering
where she popped off to.

317
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:18,903
And you have a son who wants
to take you back to Hell.

318
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,935
So drawing attention
to yourself in a police station

319
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:24,541
in this little... getup,
not a good idea.

320
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:26,684
But I had to see
it for myself.

321
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,180
My boy, working,
toiling,

322
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:30,922
amidst humanity's muck.

323
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,817
Well, I hope it's everything
you imagined and more.

324
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:35,519
Now go see<i> Cabaret.</i> I'm sure
you'll find it riveting.

325
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:36,792
I just don't understand.

326
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,320
Of all the things that
you could do with your talents,

327
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:41,186
law enforcement?

328
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:43,564
Have you considered I might
enjoy exploring humanity?

329
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:44,863
(elevator bell dings)

330
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:46,995
They eat, darling.

331
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,130
All they do is eat.

332
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:50,595
And then afterwards,
the food comes out changed

333
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:53,614
and not for the better.

334
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:56,878
Detective.

335
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:59,141
I didn't realize

336
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:01,006
you and Charlotte knew
each other so well.

337
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:04,554
Oh, we do and we don't.
It's a long story, really.

338
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:06,421
Right, shall we
go somewhere

339
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:08,049
to, uh, celebrate
solving the case?

340
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:09,894
No. Not yet.

341
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,690
Tommy was humiliated.

342
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:13,491
Makes sense
why he'd want to kill Nick.

343
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:15,163
But something
just doesn't sit right.

344
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:17,862
Detective, you, of all people,
should know how good it feels

345
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:19,704
to punish someone
who's wronged you.

346
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:21,099
How so?
Oh, come now.

347
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:24,101
You may not be roasting
Dan's chestnuts-- yet--

348
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:26,704
but a shoulder shrug here,
a dismissive look there

349
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:28,436
could be just as effective.
Okay, fine.

350
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:30,881
Maybe I've been a little hard on
Dan lately, but he deserves it.

351
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:32,477
And I'm sure
you found it very satisfying.

352
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:33,479
But have you considered

353
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,780
for just one moment

354
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:38,521
how your fighting affects
those caught in the middle?

355
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:40,118
You mean Trixie?

356
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,720
What? No, I mean me.

357
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:43,521
Think how terribly
bored I am by it all.

358
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:46,023
Ah, look, there he is.
Now's your chance

359
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:48,586
to stop with your "will they,
won't they" nonsense.

360
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:49,585
It's not that simple.

361
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:50,796
I'm avoiding
a difficult conversation.

362
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:51,857
Well, I...

363
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:53,795
Hi.

364
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,230
There's something
you got to see.

365
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:57,465
Another apology video dropped
along with another body.

366
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,600
MAN:
I know it was wrong!

367
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:02,806
I shouldn't have posted
that video!

368
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:05,539
She didn't deserve
to be humiliated like that.

369
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:08,205
(sobs):
I'm sorry.

370
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:10,045
Â¶ Â¶

371
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:35,073
CHLOE:
(sighs) Two murders.

372
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:36,925
Same M.O.

373
00:14:36,926 --> 00:14:38,776
But Tommy was already in custody
when this guy was killed.

374
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:40,508
There's no way
he did this.

375
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:42,283
LUCIFER: Tommy wanted
his dignity back.

376
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:43,682
Whoever did this

377
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:46,453
clearly had a much grander
objective in mind.

378
00:14:46,453 --> 00:14:47,793
Ladies and gentlemen,

379
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:49,847
it looks like we're
tracking a serial killer.

380
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:56,534
Victim's Adam Wiser, 29,

381
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:58,599
worked as an assistant
at a local bank.

382
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:01,268
Time of death was two hours ago,
but apparently he's been missing

383
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:02,498
for almost two days.

384
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:04,642
Ooh, that's a long time
on a sex rack.

385
00:15:04,638 --> 00:15:07,208
Not a record,
but quite impressive.

386
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:08,737
Ella, we know
the cause of death?

387
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,812
Well, he's got broken ribs,
a ruptured spleen

388
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:14,480
and possible cranial bleeding,
which would all totally suck.

389
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:16,411
And yet, this dude asphyxiated.

390
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,946
He was choked
with an apple?

391
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:20,522
No.

392
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,490
More like an orchard.

393
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,490
We're gonna have to cut
him open to get the rest.

394
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:26,762
That's messed up.

395
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,490
Certainly brings new meaning
to the term "deep throat."

396
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:30,896
Why not just
kill the guy?

397
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:32,897
Why all the pomp
and circumstance?

398
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:35,499
Well, our punisher's
clearly sending a message.

399
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:37,042
Perhaps if we find the
video that Apple Boy

400
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:40,137
is apologizing for,
we'll know what that message is.

401
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,170
Hold this.
What are you doing?

402
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:44,035
The original video was filmed
on Nick's phone, right?

403
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:46,344
What if Adam's doing
the same thing?

404
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:47,746
(dialing)

405
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:49,447
(phone beeps)

406
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:52,649
(ringtone playing)

407
00:15:57,324 --> 00:15:58,894
Be careful, Detective.

408
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:00,262
Might be a booby trap.

409
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,730
(ringtone continues)

410
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:03,088
(sighs)

411
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:11,973
The video's already cued up.

412
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,910
Look at this.

413
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,646
Notice anything familiar?

414
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,415
The ball gag's
amaranth.

415
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:32,723
Just like the apple.

416
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:35,126
What, so our killer's paying
homage to a bloody sex tape?

417
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:37,728
He's recreating the crimes
he's punishing for.

418
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:39,561
First lighting Nick's
groin on fire, now this.

419
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:40,696
He's upping his game.

420
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,900
Yeah, but what's
with the outfit?

421
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:44,001
I mean, other than giving me
super creepy flashbacks

422
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:46,704
to Catholic school,
it doesn't add up.

423
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:48,906
And the woman is not
wearing one in the video.

424
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:52,308
She certainly looks too old
to be in school.

425
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:54,782
Unless she
teaches at one.

426
00:16:56,816 --> 00:16:58,716
(siren whoops)

427
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:02,348
Her name's
Sarah Aiken, 27.

428
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,355
Third grade teacher.
Cute.

429
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:07,027
Not hot, but extra points
for proclivities.

430
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:08,587
When she broke things
off with Adam,

431
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:10,995
he uploaded his
revenge porn to Wobble.

432
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:13,927
Some teachers caught wind
of it, and she was fired.

433
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:16,773
Well, maybe she took out both
Nick and our loathsome ex.

434
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,200
You know, no harm, no foul.

435
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:21,274
And no dice because she had
no connection to Nick.
Oh.

436
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:24,744
And shortly after she lost
her job, she killed herself.

437
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:27,784
What, so our poor,
sexy teacher's dead,

438
00:17:27,781 --> 00:17:29,881
and our apple-chomping
schoolboy's responsible?

439
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:32,053
And the only other connection
we were able to find

440
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:34,922
is that both victims posted
their illicit videos to Wobble.

441
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:38,021
So, maybe some sicko
saw both videos

442
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:40,224
and decided to take action.
"Sicko"?

443
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,886
Sounds to me like someone's
doing our job for us.

444
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:45,496
We don't exact
vengeance, Lucifer.

445
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:47,098
Well, maybe we should.

446
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,700
As far as I'm concerned,

447
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:50,301
these little wankers
got exactly what they deserved.

448
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:51,373
See you later.

449
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:53,201
Hey, where are you going?

450
00:17:53,206 --> 00:17:54,636
We have to find out
who did this.

451
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:55,841
Well, I thought
someone out there

452
00:17:55,842 --> 00:17:57,812
was stealing my job,
but far be it for me

453
00:17:57,811 --> 00:17:59,981
to stand in the way
of excellent work.

454
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:01,379
I'm off for a drink.

455
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:03,111
Â¶ Hey Â¶

456
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:06,284
Â¶ Hey Â¶

457
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:08,216
LINDA (chuckles):
No.

458
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:10,661
Honestly, I'm impressed.

459
00:18:10,657 --> 00:18:13,257
It's hard going out on your own.

460
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,989
Changing old habits.

461
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:17,725
I admire the steps
you're taking.

462
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,660
Well, don't
admire too much.

463
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,526
I'm still coming to Lux.

464
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:23,474
Hmm, yes.

465
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,140
Baby steps are fine.

466
00:18:25,138 --> 00:18:28,238
Plus, the view here is... nice.

467
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:29,241
(chuckles softly)

468
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:34,483
The real key
is to avoid setbacks.

469
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:40,589
(sighs) Setbacks that are tall,
blond and have a special place

470
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:41,887
in Hell?
Mm.

471
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:42,888
Hi, Maze.

472
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:46,017
Hi, human.

473
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:50,962
I need to get rid
of that bitch.

474
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:53,764
Now I know
why you're still here.

475
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:56,226
Why?

476
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:59,066
You and Lucifer are very close.

477
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,806
It's normal that you be
jealous of a new girlfriend.

478
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:03,809
(laughs)

479
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,840
I'm not jealous.
Ah. Mm-hmm.

480
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:08,245
And she's not his girlfriend.
(chuckles)

481
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:10,248
She's just toxic.

482
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,320
Lucifer doesn't
see it, but I do.

483
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,688
Oh, so you want
to protect him?

484
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:17,257
I want her to get
what she deserves.

485
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:19,857
Which, at the very
least, is a head-butt.

486
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:21,089
I'll be right back.

487
00:19:21,094 --> 00:19:21,894
Okay, okay.

488
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:23,995
(chuckles):
Okay, maybe...

489
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:25,997
we should start
with our words.

490
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:28,599
Perhaps as Lucifer's friend,
you can talk to him.

491
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:31,141
Express how you feel.

492
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:32,837
He won't listen.

493
00:19:34,207 --> 00:19:36,667
But maybe someone else will.

494
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,011
Where are you going?

495
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:40,652
Taking your advice.

496
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:42,347
Hey, Man Bun.

497
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:43,678
Take care of my friend.

498
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:46,551
(sighs)

499
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:48,753
Why do I even try?

500
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:51,415
Because you're
an incredible woman.

501
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:53,224
Oh.

502
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:54,726
Thanks.

503
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:59,462
So, I reached out to Wobble
to cross-reference who saw

504
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:01,165
both Nick and Adam's videos.

505
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:03,167
And?
They lawyered up.

506
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:05,439
Hid behind privacy laws,
and without a warrant,

507
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:08,038
Wobble won't let us anywhere
near their viewership data.

508
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:12,281
Okay, pull the warrant,
and I'm on my way there.

509
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:15,448
No problem.

510
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:17,178
Dan.

511
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:18,323
Um...

512
00:20:18,318 --> 00:20:20,318
So I've been thinking
about the trip,

513
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,920
and, um...

514
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:24,191
I don't think it's
fair to put Trixie

515
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,790
in the middle of our
problems, you know?

516
00:20:26,793 --> 00:20:28,933
So you want to skip it.

517
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:31,598
No, I want to spare us
all heartache and...

518
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:33,928
I just feel like if
we go on the trip

519
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:35,933
and, you know, we pretend
everything's fine,

520
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:38,135
then we're just lying to her.

521
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:40,937
Yeah.

522
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,470
All right.

523
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:44,405
Â¶ All eyes on me Â¶

524
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,340
Â¶ Whoo... Â¶

525
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:51,215
Â¶ All eyes on me Â¶

526
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:53,217
Â¶ Whoo... Â¶

527
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,185
Â¶ All eyes on me Â¶

528
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,820
Â¶ Revving it up Â¶

529
00:20:58,825 --> 00:21:00,755
Â¶ Getting started,
time to press play Â¶

530
00:21:04,197 --> 00:21:05,157
Â¶ Plugging it in Â¶

531
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:06,934
Â¶ Level ten through
the earth shake Â¶

532
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:11,496
Â¶ But we're the wild
and the free Â¶

533
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:12,574
Â¶ No controlling... Â¶

534
00:21:12,572 --> 00:21:14,112
Excuse me.

535
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:15,167
Excuse me. Mom.

536
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:16,514
Oh.

537
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:17,838
What do you think
you're doing?

538
00:21:17,844 --> 00:21:19,114
I'm taking your lead, son.

539
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:20,312
Learning about
your beloved humanity.

540
00:21:20,313 --> 00:21:22,313
By dancing at my club?

541
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:23,915
Well, I saw all the people

542
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,516
on the tables smiling
and I wanted to discover

543
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:26,978
what they were so happy about.

544
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:30,516
Oh, is it possible it's
the money that I pay them?

545
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:32,163
It's possible.

546
00:21:32,158 --> 00:21:34,858
But I have to admit
that when I started dancing,

547
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:38,401
rubbing up against
the other humans,

548
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:39,498
I got a tingling
sensation...

549
00:21:39,499 --> 00:21:40,999
Okay, that's enough.

550
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,400
Excuse me, excuse me, thank you.

551
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:44,373
I don't understand.

552
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,000
I thought you'd be
pleased by my effort.

553
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:48,005
Disturbed is more like it.

554
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:50,807
Are you actually trying
to systematically disrupt

555
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,540
every part of my life?
No.

556
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:55,275
I'm trying to<i> learn</i> about
every part of your life.

557
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:56,551
Oh, right.

558
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:58,019
How's that going for you so far?

559
00:21:58,017 --> 00:22:00,147
Well, quite
illuminating, actually.

560
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:04,163
I understand now why you
have this provocative club.

561
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:05,917
I understand why
you amused yourself

562
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:07,925
with that
curvaceous savage.
(sighs)

563
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:09,787
But what I don't
understand...

564
00:22:09,796 --> 00:22:11,156
Is my human job. Yes, I know.

565
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:14,204
It's very simple:
I'm a civilian consultant.

566
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,930
But why do you
still punish people?

567
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:18,766
It's what I've always done.

568
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:20,041
That's not true.

569
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:22,709
That's who your father
wanted you to be.

570
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:26,683
Are you still trying
to win him over?

571
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,449
Careful, Mother.

572
00:22:28,448 --> 00:22:29,248
Why?

573
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:31,418
Are you going
to punish me?

574
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,200
LEILA:
I'm sorry, Detective.

575
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:50,601
I looked into
the two videos in question,

576
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:52,273
and unfortunately,
there was no overlap.

577
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:53,941
CHLOE:
Doesn't make any sense.

578
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,010
I'll need a list of everyone
who saw the videos.

579
00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:59,208
Sadly, we don't track people,
just I.P. addresses.

580
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:02,382
(sighs) Maybe I'm looking
at this the wrong way.

581
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:05,222
Can you take me through how
your video process works?

582
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:07,948
Well, our users can upload
anything they want.

583
00:23:07,954 --> 00:23:09,954
And if we find that
the content's inappropriate--

584
00:23:09,956 --> 00:23:13,216
uh, anything from
animal cruelty to beheadings--

585
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:14,686
it gets taken down.

586
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:16,164
By who?

587
00:23:16,162 --> 00:23:17,562
Our content moderators.

588
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:18,833
Huh.

589
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:20,701
LEILA: Most of them
only last a few months.

590
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,900
Frankly, most people

591
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:24,001
can't stomach something
so dark or upsetting.

592
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:25,643
Right.
(Lucifer laughing)

593
00:23:25,638 --> 00:23:28,168
LUCIFER:
God, that has got to smart.

594
00:23:28,174 --> 00:23:29,874
(Lucifer laughs)

595
00:23:29,876 --> 00:23:32,476
Can I see that again?

596
00:23:32,478 --> 00:23:34,038
Lucifer?

597
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:35,976
Oh, Detective.
You're here.

598
00:23:35,982 --> 00:23:37,622
Did you know that this room

599
00:23:37,617 --> 00:23:39,247
collects all the best parts
of the Internet?

600
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:41,122
Can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah, yeah.

601
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,020
But you got to see this--
a-a naked man

602
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:45,022
thinks he can jump
on the back of a rhino.

603
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:47,324
(laughs): You'll never
guess what he lands on.

604
00:23:47,326 --> 00:23:49,556
Actually, you probably will.

605
00:23:49,562 --> 00:23:51,332
What? You've seen it already?

606
00:23:53,466 --> 00:23:55,396
(sighs)

607
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:56,601
What are you doing here?

608
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:57,902
Trying to catch our killer.

609
00:23:57,904 --> 00:23:59,804
Duh.
I thought you
didn't care

610
00:23:59,806 --> 00:24:02,006
whether this sicko
was brought to justice.
Oh, I don't.

611
00:24:02,008 --> 00:24:04,778
But then I realized that
our killer may have the answer

612
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:07,207
to a question that I'm,
you know, struggling with.

613
00:24:07,213 --> 00:24:08,253
Mm.

614
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:09,677
Why does he punish?

615
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:10,882
That's it?

616
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:13,183
First you want to teach
this vigilante a lesson,

617
00:24:13,186 --> 00:24:15,286
and now you want to
have a talk with him?
Yes.

618
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:17,318
And lucky for me, I found out
where you were headed.

619
00:24:17,323 --> 00:24:19,793
(chuckles): I mean,
these videos are enthralling.

620
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:21,162
CHLOE: No, I-I can't.
I can't watch these.

621
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,760
(growling)
LUCIFER:
Oh, I've seen worse.

622
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:24,962
But never so many collected
in one single room.

623
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:27,064
You know, if I ever
go back to Hell,

624
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:29,066
I am getting me
one of these.

625
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:31,068
Selfish bastards
get to see everything.

626
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:34,270
(woman screaming over video)

627
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:36,273
(scoffs)
Yeah.

628
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:38,883
They do.

629
00:24:38,878 --> 00:24:40,878
I know where
the overlap is.

630
00:24:45,518 --> 00:24:47,718
Â¶ Â¶

631
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:16,209
(sighs)

632
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:18,775
(knock on door)

633
00:25:18,784 --> 00:25:21,754
MAZE: Amenadiel,
I know you're in there.

634
00:25:22,622 --> 00:25:24,292
(vacuum whirring)

635
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,020
Open up!

636
00:25:28,961 --> 00:25:30,461
(vacuum stops)

637
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:33,861
Hey.

638
00:25:37,837 --> 00:25:40,037
What are you hiding?

639
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,709
Nothing.

640
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:43,137
(chuckles)

641
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:48,881
(laughs):
Oh.

642
00:25:51,117 --> 00:25:53,917
I see what's going on with you.

643
00:25:55,354 --> 00:25:57,424
You do?
Sure.

644
00:25:57,423 --> 00:26:00,323
Humans say that rebound sex
is important after a breakup.

645
00:26:00,326 --> 00:26:03,456
You don't have to hide
that you're getting some.

646
00:26:03,462 --> 00:26:04,862
(laughs)

647
00:26:04,864 --> 00:26:06,364
I'm not.

648
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:10,531
Right.

649
00:26:10,536 --> 00:26:13,236
Of course. I didn't want you
to feel awkward.

650
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:15,039
Silly me.

651
00:26:16,876 --> 00:26:19,976
(sighs)

652
00:26:19,979 --> 00:26:21,749
So what are
you doing here?

653
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:25,477
I have a problem.

654
00:26:25,484 --> 00:26:26,624
I need your help.

655
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:29,089
There's a new...

656
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:31,558
woman in Lucifer's life.

657
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:34,287
I want her gone,
but he won't listen to me.

658
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:36,663
And why do you care?
I thought you were

659
00:26:36,662 --> 00:26:38,362
stepping away
from both of us.

660
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:42,647
I am.

661
00:26:42,651 --> 00:26:43,831
But before I do,
I need you...
I'll talk to him.

662
00:26:43,836 --> 00:26:45,236
Yeah.

663
00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:50,707
Well, that was easy.

664
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,610
I'm his big brother, Maze.

665
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,511
I really should start looking
out for him more often.

666
00:26:56,349 --> 00:26:58,519
Okay.

667
00:26:58,517 --> 00:27:00,247
Thank you.

668
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:03,491
All right. Thanks.

669
00:27:03,489 --> 00:27:05,089
Dan's working with
Wobble to trace

670
00:27:05,091 --> 00:27:06,821
what moderator may have
pulled both videos.

671
00:27:06,826 --> 00:27:08,026
Hopefully, we'll
have an answer soon.

672
00:27:08,027 --> 00:27:09,727
Then why are you
so sure the killer's

673
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:11,059
one of these misanthropes?

674
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:12,533
CHLOE:
Well, serial killers

675
00:27:12,531 --> 00:27:14,061
usually start with
someone they know.

676
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:15,866
If the killer worked
here, they knew Nick,

677
00:27:15,868 --> 00:27:18,068
saw how much the
prank hurt Tommy.

678
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,370
So you think
seeing someone they recognized

679
00:27:19,372 --> 00:27:22,212
in one of these twisted videos
finally made them snap?

680
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:24,508
Maybe it awakened
something in them.

681
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:27,880
Something that was always there,
just fighting to get out.

682
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,750
(chuckles) But...

683
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:33,680
they were just
trying to do a job.

684
00:27:33,686 --> 00:27:35,216
Job no one else wanted.

685
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:37,221
Well, maybe they chose
that for a reason.

686
00:27:37,223 --> 00:27:40,563
No one chooses
to be a sin-eater, Detective.

687
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,629
No one wants
to be custodian

688
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:46,499
of the world's filth.
Why would they?

689
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:49,869
Absorbing the worst humanity has
to offer, day in and day out.

690
00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:51,369
Changes you.

691
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,040
So you think
it's the job's fault

692
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,169
that they started to punish?

693
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,373
People don't
arrive broken.

694
00:27:55,374 --> 00:27:58,384
They start with passion
and yearning

695
00:27:58,377 --> 00:28:02,247
till something comes along that
disabuses them of those notions.

696
00:28:02,248 --> 00:28:05,048
Hmm.

697
00:28:05,051 --> 00:28:08,651
Which means... that none
of these people did it.

698
00:28:08,654 --> 00:28:09,894
Okay. I'm not following.

699
00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:11,389
Well, look at Tim there,

700
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:14,460
with the photos
of his ugly children.

701
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,660
Ivan and his flowerpots.

702
00:28:16,662 --> 00:28:18,762
Poor Andrea's still hoping
Destiny's Child

703
00:28:18,764 --> 00:28:20,064
get back together.

704
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:21,066
Don't you see?

705
00:28:21,067 --> 00:28:23,967
These people still have hope.

706
00:28:25,771 --> 00:28:27,341
CHLOE: Excuse me.
Yeah.

707
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:30,009
Who's had this
job the longest?
Um...

708
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:31,209
maybe me.

709
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,910
I've been at it
two whole months.

710
00:28:32,912 --> 00:28:34,612
Huh.
Oh. Anyone else?

711
00:28:34,613 --> 00:28:35,813
No.

712
00:28:35,815 --> 00:28:37,445
Other than Leila, of course.

713
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:39,920
Leila, your boss?
Yeah. She started
as a moderator

714
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,919
before the company blew up.

715
00:28:41,921 --> 00:28:43,691
She was the first of us.

716
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:45,689
Thanks.

717
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:48,191
Leila knew Nick, she had
access to the videos.

718
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:49,564
If she's behind this...

719
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:53,232
She's known what we've been
doing every step of the way.

720
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:56,102
Dan, I need you to see if
you can trace the videos

721
00:28:56,102 --> 00:28:58,702
to one person in
particular now.

722
00:28:58,704 --> 00:29:01,514
(sighs) We're looking
at Leila Simms.

723
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:09,008
I can't believe we had the
killer right under our nose.

724
00:29:09,014 --> 00:29:12,184
And she's gone.

725
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:14,694
TouchÃ©, Leila. TouchÃ©.

726
00:29:22,795 --> 00:29:25,655
Luci?

727
00:29:25,664 --> 00:29:28,574
Luci, you home?

728
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:30,567
Â¶ Â¶

729
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:36,108
He's not here.

730
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,978
He left in quite
the hurry before.

731
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:42,007
Think it was
something I said.

732
00:29:43,182 --> 00:29:46,082
I'm sorry.
Are you his latest, uh...?

733
00:29:46,085 --> 00:29:49,415
Trust me,
I'm not his latest anything.

734
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:51,161
All right.

735
00:29:51,157 --> 00:29:53,157
So, what<i> are</i> you
doing here, then?

736
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:54,989
I'm having a bit of

737
00:29:54,994 --> 00:29:57,964
an existential crisis,
I suppose.

738
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:00,733
I've been known
to be a good listener.

739
00:30:00,733 --> 00:30:02,903
Okay.

740
00:30:02,902 --> 00:30:04,502
Uh...

741
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:06,703
I'm having some trouble
with my kids.

742
00:30:06,705 --> 00:30:08,965
Needed to get away from them
for a little bit?

743
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:11,484
No, the opposite, actually.

744
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:13,237
I'm trying
to get closer to them,

745
00:30:13,245 --> 00:30:15,605
but I'm not having much luck.

746
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:20,479
Tell me.

747
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:22,346
Are you a good son?

748
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:25,464
I try to be.

749
00:30:25,457 --> 00:30:28,357
Well, then perhaps
you can explain.

750
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,330
Would a good son

751
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:34,459
blindly take his father's side
in a divorce?

752
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:37,471
Would a good son

753
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:39,869
send his mother to Hell?

754
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:42,942
And would a good son

755
00:30:42,942 --> 00:30:46,142
stand here right before me,

756
00:30:46,145 --> 00:30:50,375
without a care in the world,
plotting to send me back?

757
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:54,692
Mom?

758
00:30:54,687 --> 00:31:00,317
I thought I would come to Earth
to be with my sons.

759
00:31:00,326 --> 00:31:04,286
Instead, Lucifer is obsessed
with his human job,

760
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:05,996
and you're still
your father's loyal soldier.

761
00:31:05,998 --> 00:31:10,368
I'm tired of fighting for things
that I'm never gonna have.

762
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:13,769
So just take me back, Amenadiel.

763
00:31:13,772 --> 00:31:15,772
I'm ready.

764
00:31:15,774 --> 00:31:17,514
(sighs)

765
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,180
(sniffles)

766
00:31:23,182 --> 00:31:25,252
No matter what happens,

767
00:31:25,251 --> 00:31:29,551
I will<i> always...</i> love you.

768
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:31,145
Always.

769
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:34,788
(sighs)

770
00:31:34,793 --> 00:31:36,333
Leila took down
both videos,

771
00:31:36,328 --> 00:31:38,058
killed Nick and Adam,
and then led us

772
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:40,033
by the nose until she
had time to escape.

773
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,472
Why didn't I
realize it was her?

774
00:31:41,467 --> 00:31:43,467
Because as a punisher,
she's quite adept

775
00:31:43,469 --> 00:31:44,999
at avoiding
her own medicine.

776
00:31:45,004 --> 00:31:46,704
Quite impressed, really.

777
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:48,035
(computer beeps)

778
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:51,482
CHLOE:
Hey, Dan.

779
00:31:51,477 --> 00:31:53,877
Yeah, I just saw it.
I'm already working on a trace.

780
00:31:53,879 --> 00:31:55,209
LUCIFER:
"Judgment Day"? Oh.

781
00:31:55,214 --> 00:31:57,484
People should really be careful
how they use that phrase.

782
00:31:57,483 --> 00:32:00,223
It isn't actually due
for another couple of years.

783
00:32:00,219 --> 00:32:02,119
She's gonna kill herself
live on the air.

784
00:32:02,121 --> 00:32:04,761
What?
Well, that won't do at all.

785
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:07,157
How am I supposed
to talk to her if she's dead?

786
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:08,959
Glad you have
your priorities in order.

787
00:32:08,961 --> 00:32:11,401
Thought we were dealing with
someone smart and clever,

788
00:32:11,397 --> 00:32:12,757
who tortured with
a brutal sense of irony,

789
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:14,125
but killing herself

790
00:32:14,133 --> 00:32:15,833
whilst humiliating
her company...

791
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:17,674
Doesn't fit the pattern.

792
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:21,140
Hey, Sharon, can you pull up the
video of Leila driving again?

793
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,340
Yeah. Sure.

794
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,280
Pause it there.

795
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:27,578
What are you
looking for, Detective?

796
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:28,579
Zoom in

797
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,150
to the edge of the seat.

798
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:31,679
Can you go in tighter?

799
00:32:36,855 --> 00:32:38,785
Well, I know
images can be deceiving,

800
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:41,331
but that looks an awful lot
like a gun, doesn't it?

801
00:32:41,327 --> 00:32:43,787
CHLOE:
Leila's not our killer.

802
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:45,696
She's in danger.

803
00:32:45,698 --> 00:32:47,198
You understand this
sicko pretty well.

804
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:48,729
Where do you
think he's going?

805
00:32:48,734 --> 00:32:51,944
Well, somewhere linked
to her sins, I suppose.

806
00:32:51,937 --> 00:32:53,237
We barely know Leila.

807
00:32:53,238 --> 00:32:55,008
Who knows what the killer
thinks she's done?

808
00:32:55,007 --> 00:32:56,367
Well, she runs
the company that hosts

809
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:59,035
humanity's worst depravities,
but we know she's not there.

810
00:32:59,044 --> 00:33:00,484
Hey, Dan,
how's the trace coming?

811
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:02,309
The I.P. just keeps pinging
back to Wobble's main server.

812
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,514
It's got to be
a mistake.

813
00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:11,617
Unless it's not
a mistake at all.

814
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:18,061
You know, if you take
away the blinky lights

815
00:33:18,063 --> 00:33:19,563
and add some lost souls,

816
00:33:19,565 --> 00:33:22,165
this place bares a striking
resemblance to Hell.

817
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:24,997
Shh. Listen.
(Leila speaking quietly)

818
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:28,544
LEILA:
My name is... Leila Simms.

819
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:33,712
I'm one of
the co-founders of Wobble.

820
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:37,112
I wanted to apologize
to anybody who's watching

821
00:33:37,116 --> 00:33:40,176
for... for creating a forum...

822
00:33:42,054 --> 00:33:45,064
...where evil and hate
sought a refuge.

823
00:33:45,057 --> 00:33:48,087
And there's
Queen Wobble herself.

824
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:50,193
Yeah, but where's
the killer?

825
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:52,825
And tonight I go down
with the ship.

826
00:33:52,831 --> 00:33:54,431
(sobs softly)

827
00:33:54,433 --> 00:33:56,673
Right alongside
all of those awful sins

828
00:33:56,668 --> 00:34:00,668
that-that I helped
give a voice to.

829
00:34:00,672 --> 00:34:03,172
(crying) Please, please.

830
00:34:03,175 --> 00:34:05,335
P-Please, please.

831
00:34:05,344 --> 00:34:07,984
D-Don't make me do this.

832
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,810
Please.

833
00:34:15,154 --> 00:34:16,624
(whispering):
There's Ray, the HR rep.

834
00:34:16,622 --> 00:34:20,262
Oh, goodness me,
I should have known.

835
00:34:20,259 --> 00:34:22,359
Halitosis--
first sign of evil.

836
00:34:22,361 --> 00:34:23,731
He had all the access
he needed

837
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:26,559
to find his targets
and frame Leila.

838
00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:32,299
(sobs)

839
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:35,539
What are you waiting for?
Shoot him.

840
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:37,271
If he drops that lighter,
he'll kill her.

841
00:34:37,276 --> 00:34:38,636
I don't have a shot.

842
00:34:46,718 --> 00:34:49,188
(Leila crying softly)

843
00:34:51,824 --> 00:34:54,294
Okay, Detective, this next
part will be much easier

844
00:34:54,293 --> 00:34:57,063
if you're not here, so I'm gonna
politely ask you to leave, okay?

845
00:34:57,062 --> 00:34:58,632
I'm not going anywhere.

846
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,200
We're gonna figure this out.
Just give me a second.

847
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:02,129
(sighs)

848
00:35:02,134 --> 00:35:05,504
(Leila crying)

849
00:35:05,504 --> 00:35:07,304
All right, no rush.

850
00:35:07,306 --> 00:35:09,836
Whilst you're pondering,
I'm gonna go and have a word

851
00:35:09,842 --> 00:35:11,072
with our killer.

852
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:12,336
That's a great idea.

853
00:35:13,512 --> 00:35:15,312
Sorry, say that again.

854
00:35:16,715 --> 00:35:19,475
I never meant to cause anybody
any pain.

855
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:22,852
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

856
00:35:22,855 --> 00:35:25,115
Yeah.
(whimpering)

857
00:35:25,124 --> 00:35:27,664
Hello, Raymond.

858
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:29,959
Hate to, uh,
blow up your spot,

859
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:31,862
but I have a question
to ask you before you complete

860
00:35:31,864 --> 00:35:33,464
this twisted little
mise-en-scene.

861
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:34,755
Stay back.

862
00:35:34,766 --> 00:35:37,196
I swear I will drop this,
and she is dead.

863
00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:38,602
Oh, gosh,
there's the halitosis.

864
00:35:38,604 --> 00:35:39,944
It travels, doesn't it?

865
00:35:39,938 --> 00:35:42,208
You should really get that
looked at, but first,

866
00:35:42,207 --> 00:35:46,207
indulge me this one
simple query.

867
00:35:46,211 --> 00:35:47,441
Why?

868
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:51,579
What?

869
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:54,583
Why are you a punisher?

870
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:56,546
I understand
the longing for justice

871
00:35:56,555 --> 00:35:59,585
or the joy
of sweet revenge,

872
00:35:59,591 --> 00:36:01,691
but no one's forcing you
to do this,

873
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:04,663
so why would you
take it upon yourself?

874
00:36:06,732 --> 00:36:09,072
Because I couldn't
take it anymore.

875
00:36:09,067 --> 00:36:10,627
All that evil

876
00:36:10,636 --> 00:36:12,036
is constantly spreading.

877
00:36:12,037 --> 00:36:13,497
I had to do something.

878
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,040
I had to punish them.

879
00:36:17,042 --> 00:36:19,842
You're wrong.

880
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:21,605
You didn't have
to do anything.

881
00:36:21,613 --> 00:36:23,213
You<i> wanted</i> to punish them.

882
00:36:23,215 --> 00:36:24,705
No, that's not true.

883
00:36:24,716 --> 00:36:26,916
Yes, it started with Nick--
that was impulsive.

884
00:36:26,919 --> 00:36:28,849
But then you got
a taste for blood,

885
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:30,594
and it felt good, didn't it?

886
00:36:30,589 --> 00:36:31,959
I was doing my part.

887
00:36:31,957 --> 00:36:33,117
You had big plans

888
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:34,415
to go on vengeance quest

889
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:35,715
until we came
nipping at your heels,

890
00:36:35,727 --> 00:36:38,327
at which point
poor Leila took the fall.

891
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:39,630
An innocent!
No, you're wrong.

892
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:40,961
And then what,
you'd stop?

893
00:36:40,966 --> 00:36:43,396
Get away scot-free?

894
00:36:43,402 --> 00:36:45,642
(chuckles)

895
00:36:45,637 --> 00:36:49,407
We both know you can't stop
because you love it!

896
00:36:49,408 --> 00:36:51,538
Just like the people
you punished.

897
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:53,113
I don't! I...

898
00:36:57,749 --> 00:36:59,579
I do.

899
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:06,260
I-I like seeing them
beg for forgiveness.

900
00:37:06,258 --> 00:37:08,118
You see, the difference
between us

901
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:11,286
is that you became
part of the problem, Ray.

902
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:14,056
Someone deserving
punishment.

903
00:37:16,335 --> 00:37:17,665
You're right.

904
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:21,438
I do.

905
00:37:22,941 --> 00:37:24,541
We all do.

906
00:37:25,944 --> 00:37:28,084
No, wait!

907
00:37:31,049 --> 00:37:32,979
(fire alarm blaring)

908
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:41,625
(alarm stops)

909
00:37:45,364 --> 00:37:48,904
Man, you really don't shut up.

910
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,800
Congratulations, Detective.

911
00:37:50,802 --> 00:37:53,602
I suppose you could say
I look quite extinguished.

912
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:55,439
Right.

913
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,540
Shall we get you untied?

914
00:38:00,512 --> 00:38:03,312
Burning the midnight oil?

915
00:38:03,315 --> 00:38:05,775
Ha, ha, what can I say?

916
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:07,924
Being everybody's
bitch really sucks.

917
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:09,949
Yeah, well,
it won't last forever.

918
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:13,255
So I've had some time to think,

919
00:38:13,258 --> 00:38:16,858
and, um... I realize that

920
00:38:16,862 --> 00:38:19,002
I've been really harsh lately.

921
00:38:18,997 --> 00:38:19,797
It's okay...

922
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:22,068
No, let me finish,
please.

923
00:38:22,067 --> 00:38:25,137
I've been really hard on you
for a while now.

924
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:27,737
And I've been...

925
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:29,939
so upset and so angry.

926
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:34,141
And... I did,
I felt really betrayed.

927
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:35,776
I know.

928
00:38:35,781 --> 00:38:37,951
But I realize you've...

929
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:40,149
you've been working so hard
to make it right,

930
00:38:40,152 --> 00:38:43,592
and I feel like,
for the sake of Trixie,

931
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:45,288
that we should go on the trip.

932
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:47,120
You know, we should go,

933
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:49,985
like we always have.

934
00:38:52,097 --> 00:38:53,297
I can't do that.

935
00:38:53,298 --> 00:38:55,628
Wh... What do you mean?

936
00:38:58,337 --> 00:39:00,597
You were right before.

937
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,970
We shouldn't lie
to our daughter.

938
00:39:03,975 --> 00:39:05,935
Okay.

939
00:39:07,979 --> 00:39:10,879
Look, I-I'm always gonna be
Trixie's dad.

940
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:15,124
And I'm always gonna be
part of your lives.

941
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,820
But we've been living
in the past for too long.

942
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,990
We're no, we're no good
for Trixie

943
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:26,025
if we're no good for each other.

944
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:32,738
But I think we both
know the truth.

945
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:40,339
It's time we get a divorce.

946
00:39:51,523 --> 00:39:53,723
(elevator bell dings)

947
00:39:59,097 --> 00:40:00,927
Hello, Luci.

948
00:40:04,536 --> 00:40:06,566
Tell me you didn't do it.

949
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:07,901
Do what?

950
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:09,166
Don't play stupid with me.

951
00:40:09,174 --> 00:40:11,014
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

952
00:40:12,377 --> 00:40:13,877
Easy, Lucifer.

953
00:40:13,879 --> 00:40:15,279
Your brother didn't
send me to Hell,

954
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,250
if that's what
you're worried about.

955
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:20,419
But you were so adamant.

956
00:40:20,419 --> 00:40:21,949
I told you, Lucifer,

957
00:40:21,953 --> 00:40:24,753
a mother's love counts
for more than you think.

958
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:26,916
My time on Earth
has helped me to realize

959
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:29,725
that Father has a tendency
to overreact.

960
00:40:29,728 --> 00:40:32,158
So you're going
against Dad?

961
00:40:33,532 --> 00:40:35,672
Things change, brother.

962
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:37,227
Do they?

963
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:41,000
Well, I for one am grateful
that we're all just

964
00:40:41,006 --> 00:40:44,466
in the same room, together,
as a family again.

965
00:40:44,476 --> 00:40:46,936
Yes, not so fast, Mother.

966
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:48,745
You see, I did
make a promise,

967
00:40:48,747 --> 00:40:50,647
and I am a man of my word.

968
00:40:50,649 --> 00:40:52,479
I told you
that you could stay here

969
00:40:52,484 --> 00:40:53,824
until I figured out how to

970
00:40:53,819 --> 00:40:55,749
reconcile my
deal with Dad,

971
00:40:55,754 --> 00:40:57,794
and now I have.

972
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,159
So you're going to
punish me anyway?

973
00:40:59,157 --> 00:41:01,157
I am, indeed.
And not because

974
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:04,029
I've been brainwashed by Dad
or I'm trying to prove anything.

975
00:41:04,029 --> 00:41:07,959
I punish because I'm good at it.

976
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:10,166
I like giving people their due.

977
00:41:11,603 --> 00:41:13,043
Makes me happy.

978
00:41:13,038 --> 00:41:16,738
I suppose I can't ask
for a better reason.

979
00:41:16,741 --> 00:41:18,611
(scoffs softly)

980
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:21,040
Which brings me
to your sentence.

981
00:41:22,714 --> 00:41:24,884
Mother... (inhales sharply)

982
00:41:24,883 --> 00:41:28,053
you shall remain
right here on Earth

983
00:41:28,053 --> 00:41:31,253
amongst the creatures
you so despise...

984
00:41:31,256 --> 00:41:32,416
as one of them.

985
00:41:32,424 --> 00:41:34,424
Wait.

986
00:41:34,426 --> 00:41:35,786
You're going to send me

987
00:41:35,794 --> 00:41:38,234
into the life
of Charlotte Richards?

988
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,700
Mm-hmm.

989
00:41:39,698 --> 00:41:41,828
Well, how's that
supposed to work?
Not my problem.

990
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,373
And what if I refuse?

991
00:41:43,368 --> 00:41:46,238
You can't fight this;
you're human now.

992
00:41:46,238 --> 00:41:47,438
But that husband...

993
00:41:47,439 --> 00:41:48,669
And there's children, right?

994
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:49,943
They're going to<i> need</i> things.

995
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:51,911
Oh, I'm counting on it.

996
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:54,110
But if you truly want
to be with your sons,

997
00:41:54,112 --> 00:41:57,212
then that's the price
that you have to pay.

998
00:42:06,725 --> 00:42:09,485
So be it.

999
00:42:24,643 --> 00:42:26,243
(gasps)

1000
00:42:26,244 --> 00:42:27,444
(grunting)

1001
00:42:27,445 --> 00:42:29,275
Your money or your life, bitch.

1002
00:42:29,281 --> 00:42:31,111
I-I choose money.

1003
00:42:31,917 --> 00:42:34,077
Does anyone choose life?

1004
00:42:34,085 --> 00:42:36,185
That doesn't very...
Come here!

1005
00:42:36,187 --> 00:42:38,417
I'll give you what you want!
Just hold on.

1006
00:42:38,423 --> 00:42:40,363
I said, hold on!

1007
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:45,188
