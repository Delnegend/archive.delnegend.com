1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:03,002
<i> Previously on</i> Lucifer...
DAN:<i> Still no sign of Lucifer?</i>

2
00:00:03,004 --> 00:00:06,138
It's been two weeks.
He's gone.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,606
LUCIFER:
Detective!

4
00:00:07,608 --> 00:00:08,707
<i> Meet Candy Morningstar,</i>

5
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:10,109
my wife.
(giggles)

6
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:12,311
Lucifer's
concocting a plan.

7
00:00:12,313 --> 00:00:13,779
What if there is
no hidden agenda, Mom?

8
00:00:13,781 --> 00:00:14,947
Why would I be surprised?

9
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:16,949
<i> You disappeared after</i>
<i> I almost died?</i>

10
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:19,685
Does Chloe know that
you<i> zagged</i> Candy?

11
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:20,786
Everything I felt for her

12
00:00:20,788 --> 00:00:22,321
<i> was smoke and mirrors,</i>

13
00:00:22,323 --> 00:00:23,455
<i> courtesy of Dad.</i>

14
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:24,990
So it's okay
to ignore her feelings?

15
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:26,158
Feelings that aren't real.

16
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,126
But she doesn't know that.

17
00:00:27,128 --> 00:00:29,194
Which is why
I had to save her!

18
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,295
From you.

19
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:31,630
I manipulated him.

20
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:33,298
I pushed him too hard.

21
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,700
I did this.

22
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:36,135
The Oscar goes to
Candy Morningstar.

23
00:00:36,137 --> 00:00:37,669
You think they bought it?

24
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:39,004
My mother doesn't know
what hit her.

25
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:40,339
Thank you for helping me

26
00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:42,674
peek inside that
scheming head of hers.

27
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:45,077
What if I told you
that the Flaming Sword is

28
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:46,645
<i> Azrael's blade?</i>

29
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:48,647
<i>The weapon that can cut through</i>
<i> the Gates of Heaven itself.</i>

30
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:50,783
We have everything we need
to go home.

31
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,990
Azrael's blade.

32
00:00:57,992 --> 00:00:58,924
You're sure?

33
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:00,426
I am.

34
00:01:00,428 --> 00:01:01,827
So if we could just
get your brother

35
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:05,731
to stop drinking and
show us where he hid it...

36
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:09,001
I just wanted you
to tell him what you told me,

37
00:01:09,003 --> 00:01:10,502
before I make a mess.

38
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:13,839
What mess are
you going to...

39
00:01:13,841 --> 00:01:16,141
That's where it's been
this whole time?

40
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:20,212
Put it somewhere
I could keep an eye on it.

41
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:21,547
Wouldn't want someone
to incite another

42
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:23,015
stabbing rampage, now, would we?

43
00:01:23,017 --> 00:01:25,551
Well, it's not my fault humans
can't handle the divine.

44
00:01:25,553 --> 00:01:26,919
Besides, if I
hadn't done that,

45
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:30,856
we wouldn't have found out
what that blade actually is.

46
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:33,258
And you really think
that this is the Flaming Sword?

47
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,060
I thought Father destroyed it
during my rebellion

48
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:36,628
so I wouldn't use it
against Him.

49
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,063
Father<i> said</i> He destroyed it.

50
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:40,766
Apparently, He just hid it
in plain sight.

51
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:45,104
But it's so small
and so... not flaming.

52
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:49,475
That's because only you,
my Lightbringer,

53
00:01:49,477 --> 00:01:51,543
can ignite it.

54
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:52,978
Well, what am I supposed to do,

55
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,447
dip it in some whiskey
and light a match?

56
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:58,317
Last time it caught
flame, you were angry,

57
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:00,552
so think about your Father;
that should do it.

58
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:02,221
All right.
(clears throat)

59
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:05,491
(exhales)

60
00:02:07,495 --> 00:02:09,094
(strains):
No!

61
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:10,963
Right, back to my whiskey plan.

62
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:12,564
No, you're much too calm.

63
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:14,833
When it flamed before,
you were furious.

64
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:18,103
So you're saying the blade
can sense my emotional state?

65
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:19,471
It's the most powerful weapon

66
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:20,906
in the universe, Mum--

67
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:23,242
the sword that guarded Eden,
not a groovy mood ring.

68
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:25,077
Maybe I should try it.

69
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,745
Your brother is the
Lightbringer, Amenadiel.

70
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:29,581
He just needs to apply
himself and get angry!

71
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,817
Well, I can't just
get ang... Aah!

72
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,319
Bloody hell!

73
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,155
Well, it was worth a shot.

74
00:02:36,157 --> 00:02:38,257
Right. Maybe Amenadiel
should try it.

75
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:42,094
Here, why don't you hold it,
and I'll kick you in the...

76
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:43,695
Boys!

77
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:46,632
We need to work
together on this.

78
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:47,866
We're so close now.

79
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:49,368
Are we, Mom?

80
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,303
Because our return home hinges

81
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:54,439
on Lucifer being able
to control his emotions.

82
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:56,175
Oh, you've no faith
in me, brother? Good.

83
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:58,377
Means I get to prove you wrong.

84
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,612
(scoffs)

85
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:09,454
So the three of you plan
to use this... Flaming Sword

86
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:11,790
to cut through the
Gates of Heaven

87
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,158
and go home?

88
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,960
That's the plan, yes.

89
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:17,229
Do you mean actual gates?

90
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:18,830
Like big and pearly?

91
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:20,165
Are we talking clouds?

92
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:23,202
Harps? Old dudes in white robes?

93
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:24,336
And my dad is Morgan Freeman?

94
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:27,139
Focus, Doctor.
Now, come on.

95
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:30,309
I need you to help me
control my emotions.

96
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:32,144
Well, emotions can't be
controlled, Lucifer.

97
00:03:32,146 --> 00:03:35,314
What?
Isn't that your entire job?

98
00:03:35,316 --> 00:03:37,583
My job is to help you
understand your emotions.

99
00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:40,752
I can help you become aware
of what it is you're feeling,

100
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:45,090
or trying to
<i> avoid</i> feeling.

101
00:03:48,596 --> 00:03:50,362
Right, you've got
that look on your face

102
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:51,597
when you're saying
something insightful

103
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,432
and waiting for me
to figure it out.

104
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:56,501
I think you married her
to hide something.

105
00:03:57,838 --> 00:04:00,005
Or<i> from</i> something.
Right, look,

106
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:03,008
what I may or may not be hiding
is beside the point, Doctor.

107
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,010
Either way,
I need the sword lit.

108
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:08,013
So, come on.
Emotions. Chop, chop.

109
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:09,681
You clearly have a lot
of walls up, Lucifer.

110
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:11,350
Between yourself
and your emotions,

111
00:04:11,352 --> 00:04:13,919
and now between yourself and me.

112
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:16,021
If you're unwilling
to bring those walls down,

113
00:04:16,023 --> 00:04:17,789
I can't help you.

114
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:21,193
(sighs)

115
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:23,328
(rock music playing)

116
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,867
(rock music playing through
Maze's earbuds stops)

117
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:30,269
What the hell, Decker?

118
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:31,603
No breakfast?

119
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,573
Oh, I forgot. Sorry.

120
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:35,707
You forgot?

121
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:37,509
Chloe Decker forgot?

122
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:41,079
Are you okay?

123
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,115
What did you do
with my roommate?

124
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:45,717
She would never ask
about my feelings.

125
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:47,252
(laughs):
Oh, feelings?

126
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:49,721
No, I was thinking brain tumor,

127
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:53,025
early-onset dementia, chlamydia.

128
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:58,797
Uh, well, yeah.

129
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,732
I guess I'm still a little upset

130
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:03,568
that Lucifer just
disappeared on me

131
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,104
and got married
just when we were...

132
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:08,273
(sighs) You know, I don't
know what we were.

133
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:10,575
(rock music playing loudly
through earbuds)

134
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:13,412
And sure, he got it annulled
right away, but, you know,

135
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:15,080
that almost makes it worse.

136
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:18,450
(rock music continues
through earbuds)

137
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:20,419
Focus on Trixie.

138
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:22,287
And I'm-I'm worried about her.

150
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:47,612
Makes me...

151
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:49,381
nauseous.

152
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:52,417
Of course.

153
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,822

Tall, non-fat
almond milk latte

158
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:10,001
with sugar-free caramel drizzle
and no vodka this time.

159
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:11,370
What's the occasion?

160
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:13,472
Well, I thought we should
celebrate our first day together

161
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:15,140
as crime-solving divorcees.

162
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:16,308
(laughs)

163
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,076
Ah, making a joke you
don't like. Check.

164
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:20,145
See? We'll be back
to normal in no time.

165
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:23,348
Uh, not until you start whining
about how boring the case is.

166
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,650
(chuckles) Well,
touché, Detective.

167
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:28,420
Our victim's name
is Debbie Lang.

168
00:06:28,422 --> 00:06:30,822
She worked as the head of
administrations of a very

169
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:33,225
prestigious elementary school
on the Westside called...

170
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:34,559
called Starford.

171
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:37,162
How could a career in
education pay for all this?

172
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:39,364
L.A. private
schools are insane.

173
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:41,566
You know, money
gets thrown around.

174
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,068
What do we have?

175
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,203
Well, poor Debbie was
stabbed in the back,

176
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:46,371
literally.

177
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:47,572
DAN:
Maybe figuratively, too.

178
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:48,840
There was no signs of B&E,

179
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,542
which suggests
she knew who her killer was.

180
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:53,111
Anyone recover
the murder weapon?
No, not yet.

181
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:55,714
ELLA: You'd think knife,
but the circumference

182
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:57,849
of the wound is unusually wide,

183
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:59,885
like it was a... fat knife.

184
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:01,052
LUCIFER:
PhD in psychology,

185
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:03,688
certificate for
behavioral therapy.

186
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,524
I should have thought
this woman had figured out

187
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:07,025
human interaction,
yet she provoked someone

188
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:08,393
into killing her?

189
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:10,195
Therapists don't really
know anything, do they?

190
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:13,131
Ooh, Lucifer's projecting
his personal issues on the case.

191
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:14,699
Guess we're back to normal.

192
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:16,034
(chuckles)
ELLA:
Ah, man.

193
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:18,603
I got into it with my shrink
a couple of weeks ago.

194
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,205
What? You see
a psychologist?

195
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:22,541
I know. You wouldn't
think so, right?

196
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:24,643
'Cause I'm so upbeat
all the time.

197
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:28,046
But up here-- lot of darkness.

198
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:29,714
Really?
CHLOE:
Hey, guys?

199
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:32,317
What's this?

200
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,923
(Lucifer laughs)

201
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:40,325
Well, where do I start?

202
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:42,427
ELLA: Missing
commemorative scissors.

203
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:44,062
Looks like we found
our fat knife.

204
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:45,230
Or didn't find it,

205
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:47,432
but, you know.

206
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:48,767
So, weapon of convenience.

207
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:50,435
Could have been
a crime of passion.

208
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:51,736
Vic knew the killer,

209
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:53,872
so we should go to the school
where she worked.

210
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:02,013
I, uh...
I just can't believe it.

211
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:03,782
You know, Debbie was the best

212
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:05,517
head of admissions
we've ever had,

213
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:09,154
the heart and soul
of the Starford community.

214
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,156
We're all devastated.

215
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:13,158
Is there any way
we could see her office

216
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,160
or the last few things
she was working on?

217
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:16,161
Sure.

218
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,929
No phones on campus, please.

219
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:19,264
Sends a message

220
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:21,533
that our arms aren't actually
available to our children.

221
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:23,368
Right. Detective,
this school is weird,

222
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,003
and, yes, this
case is boring.

223
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,271
Not weird.

224
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:27,539
Unique.

225
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:30,141
Our groundbreaking
pedagogical approach

226
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:33,678
focuses on
emotional self-control.

227
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,114
Emotional self-control?
How'd you go about that, then?

228
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:37,282
Lucifer, can you go back
to being bored,

229
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:38,650
and not derail the conversation?

230
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:40,552
No, no, but this is fascinating,
Detective. The so-called expert

231
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:43,788
I just consulted insisted
emotions can't be controlled.

232
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,123
Well, we respectfully disagree.

233
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:48,293
Um, our children learn to manage
their emotions in no time.

234
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:51,129
Well, why didn't you say so
in the first place?

235
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,332
Let the schooling begin!

236
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:55,267
(chuckles)

237
00:08:57,337 --> 00:08:59,304
♪ ♪

238
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:11,182
You see, we make our students'
emotional needs the priority.

239
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:12,350
Whence our motto.

240
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:14,019
<i> "Sentio ergo sum."</i>

241
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:16,454
"I feel, therefore
I am." Hmm.

242
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:17,522
Hmm. Fascinating.

243
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:19,124
Let's just stick to the case.

244
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:20,292
Hold on, Detective.

245
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:21,793
Debbie isn't going
to un-die, is she?

246
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:24,529
Whereas I require
immediate assistance.

247
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:26,965
Look, yes, how long does
it take for rug rats

248
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:28,133
to gain emotional self-control?

249
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:29,701
MURRAY: Oh, our methods
work very quickly.

250
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:31,136
The parents see it
for themselves

251
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:33,204
after sitting in
on just one class.

252
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:35,407
Notice all the,
um, testimonials.

253
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,042
Yes.

254
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:38,243
So, Debbie.

255
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:41,246
Did she have any enemies
here at work that you know of?

256
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,782
You see, our faculty
practices the same

257
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:46,384
conflict-resolution method
as our children.

258
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:48,954
People in a conflict actually

259
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:50,555
present handmade gifts
to one another.

260
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:53,058
This was Debbie's desk,

261
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,360
and, as you can see,
not a single macramé.

262
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:59,397
What about outside
the faculty?

263
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,067
Any recent incidents
with parents maybe?

264
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:04,002
Nothing like that would
ever happen Starford.

265
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:05,804
Oh, weird, 'cause
heads of admissions

266
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:07,839
at other prestigious
private schools

267
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:10,909
are practically stalked
by eager parents, so,

268
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:13,011
maybe the spots here at Starford
just aren't as coveted.

269
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:14,012
(laughs):
Not so.

270
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:15,413
No, parents go above and beyond

271
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:17,082
to get their children
here at Starford.

272
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:19,284
And they go absolutely crazy
when they fail to land a spot.

273
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,886
Just the other day...

274
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:29,094
Well, perhaps
there was one incident.

275
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:31,262
Debbie did get
into a rather

276
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:33,465
ugly fight with
the parents of a child

277
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,433
who'd been denied admission.

278
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:36,768
It got vicious.
LUCIFER: Ooh.

279
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,770
Fisticuffs? Beat-down
at the bike sheds

280
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:39,971
after the final bell?

281
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,107
No,<i> verbally</i> vicious.

282
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:43,608
Ah, terrible grammar.
Mm-hmm.

283
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,710
Got you.

284
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:47,312
Did you see the fight?

285
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:48,346
Everyone saw it.

286
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:49,614
It happened right in
front of the school,

287
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:51,616
violating what we
like to think of as

288
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:53,652
our safe space
here at Starford.

289
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:55,286
What was said?

290
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:57,756
I will kill you.

291
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:00,625
That is what I said, yes.

292
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:02,894
But you have to understand.

293
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:05,864
I was furious that she'd
rejected our son, Wolfe.

294
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:08,133
If you have children,
I'm sure you can relate.

295
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:09,801
A Starford education

296
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:12,037
feeds almost directly
to the Ivy League.

297
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:15,140
Debbie took our money
and crushed our son's future.

298
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:17,242
What do you mean? What money?

299
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:19,744
Well, she implied that a hefty
contribution to the school

300
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:21,980
would grease the wheels
on Wolfe's admission.

301
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:24,516
So you made the contribution
and Wolfe was still rejected?

302
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:25,650
Yes.

303
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:27,686
We felt we'd been... misled.

304
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:28,987
More like robbed.

305
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:30,922
And then,
when we tried

306
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:33,191
to bring it up to Debbie,
she had the gall

307
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,527
to suggest that the school
hadn't received the donation.

308
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,162
But the check cleared!

309
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:38,229
Lying...

310
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:41,433
(clears throat)

00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:45,870
JON: I know
my husband's temper

00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,106
suggests otherwise,
but we're dealing with this

the civilized way--
through our lawyer.

314
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:53,778
We could never kill anyone.

315
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,714
Then can you explain
why the murder weapon

316
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:57,315

Mr. Morningstar,
you're under arrest.

329
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,087
(laughs)

330
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,555
I am now, am I?

331
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:39,390
On what charge?
Ladies,

332
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:40,992
he's resisting arrest.

333
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:42,160
Cuff him.

334
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:43,895
My pleasure.

335
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:45,663
Right, why do you
sexy detectives

336
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:47,866
look so disturbingly familiar?

337
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:52,337
Mum!

338
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:54,072
Mum, come on.

339
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:56,708
Come on out from
wherever you're snooping.

340
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,912
What?
Ah.

341
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:02,514
I tried to find ones that
resemble your detective.

342
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:04,749
Then again, all humans
look alike to me.

343
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:07,786
No, you did, um,
well, remarkably well.

344
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:09,420
But what on Earth for?

345
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:11,122
Since anger didn't work,
I wanted to incite

346
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,024
a different emotion.

347
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:15,260
See if that would get
the sword fired up.

348
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:17,729
A foursome isn't
an emotion, Mum.

349
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,198
Ladies, I'm sorry, but, uh,

350
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,000
it's hard for me to enjoy
a triple-decker

351
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:24,269
with my mum's hands
all over it, so...

352
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:29,073
Another time, maybe. Shame.

353
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,011
(clears throat)

354
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:34,279
Don't look so glum.

355
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:36,114
It's just a matter of time
before I get

356
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:38,483
a handle on my emotions.

357
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,218
I know it's
a matter of time.

358
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,287
That's the problem.
What's the rush?

359
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:45,023
Not like eternity's got
a "best before" date.

360
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,294
You'd understand
if you had children.

361
00:13:49,296 --> 00:13:50,628
Many of which you haven't
seen in a millennia.

362
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,996
Yes.

363
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,765
That's it, Mum. You're right.

364
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:57,135
I need to have a child.

365
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:59,070
Right, have a gander at that.

366
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:00,872
See if you can
learn a few things.

367
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:09,480
Mm-hmm.

368
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:12,350
Right, well, it seemed like
something wasn't adding up.

369
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:13,751
Yeah, okay.

370
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:15,653
Thanks, Ella.

371
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,524
(gasps) Okay.

372
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,759
(exhales)

373
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:24,729
I am gonna tie a bell
around your neck at some point.

374
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:26,731
Oh, sounds like a fun
bit of foreplay,

375
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:28,499
but I've more important
things to attend to first.

376
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:30,001
Yeah, I'm sure you do,
but hold on.

377
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:31,436
Something's bothering me.

378
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:33,338
The killer wiped the
fingerprints off the handle,

379
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,173
but not Debbie's blood
from the blade.

380
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:37,342
But the scissors were
found at their home, correct?

381
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:38,710
In the unlocked pool house,

382
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:40,445
so anyone could have
gained access to it.

383
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:42,347
So you think the killer
planted the murder weapon

384
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:44,415
on the couple last seen
fighting with the victim.

385
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:45,717
That's admirably devious.

386
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,886
Jon and Craig said
that their check cleared.

387
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:50,355
But Debbie told them the school
never received their money.

388
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:52,357
So she's lying.
But what if she
wasn't lying?

389
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:54,292
What if somebody embezzled
the money at the school?

390
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:55,894
Debbie could have found out,
she could have confronted them.

391
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:57,195
They could be the killer.

392
00:14:57,197 --> 00:14:59,197
So, you know, what we got
to do-- check the books,

393
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,732
see if there's a record
of a donation.

394
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:01,900
LUCIFER:
Right.

395
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:03,201
Baby, why are you
still in your PJs?

396
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:04,402
You're gonna miss the bus.

397
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,571
I don't have time to
drive you to school today.

398
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:07,572
Hold on.

399
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,040
Why don't you go
and deal

400
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:10,775
with the donation thingy,

401
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:14,412
and I can, uh, take the little
sh... ugar plum fairy to school.

402
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,547
Are you sure?

403
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:19,217
For my partner?
Yes, I can sacrifice.

404
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:21,219
You okay with that?

405
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:23,554
Brilliant.

406
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:26,057
♪ Yeah-eah-eah-eah-eah ♪

407
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:28,493
♪ Yeah-eah-eah-
eah-eah ♪

408
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:32,330
♪ Yeah-eah-eah-eah, yeah. ♪

409
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:34,899
You're gonna be in trouble
if my mom finds out.

410
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:37,302
What? I said
I'd drive you to school.

411
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:39,137
I never specified which one.

412
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:41,506
So, play along, and I'll
deliver my end of the bargain.

413
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:42,907
Mr. Morningstar?
Yes.

414
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:44,342
Hey. Mr. Taylor.
Ah.

415
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:45,410
You're here
for the Starford tour?

416
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:47,078
I am indeed.
I am indeed.

417
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,181
And this little creature,
who gets whatever she wants...

418
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:53,418
Trixie Morningstar.
Nice to meet you, sir.

419
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,585
Hi. (chuckles)

420
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:56,387
LUCIFER:
Ah, lovely.

421
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:04,195
So, right upstairs there
is our plant-based kitchen.

422
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:06,230
Uh, it's where the students
make their own lunch.

423
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:07,966
You know, instead of
packaged, preprocessed foods,

424
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:09,968
we, uh, we like them
to bring in, uh...

425
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,469
(quietly):
Sorry, do we have to touch?

426
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,304
Don't you have a leash or
something for when we go out?

427
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,974
Do you want to sell this or not?

428
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:17,809
It's a lot of fun...
Yes, that's all
quite riveting.

429
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:19,477
Um, where is it where
children learn to,

430
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,145
you know, harness
their emotions?

431
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,648
Uh... uh...

432
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,816
(sighs) Hold on.

433
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,317
Uh, sorry, this isn't
my normal job.

434
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:29,320
I'm just filling in till we find
a replacement for poor Debbie.

435
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,322
Oh, well, what is it
you normally do?

436
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:34,359
Uh, I'm the movement
and wellness mentor.

437
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:36,594
So you're the P.E. teacher.
Lovely.

438
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:40,665
Okay, well,
right here, this is

439
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,333
the, uh, meditation room.

440
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,035
Um, and then,
right next door is, uh,

441
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:45,670
it's where the kids do
their justice circles.

442
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,672
I need you to show me
where they teach lessons

443
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,474
on controlling your emotions.

444
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:52,176
TAYLOR:
Oh.

445
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,545
She's having emotional problems?

446
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:55,847
Who?

447
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:57,015
Oh, the child.

448
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:58,616
Sure. Probably.

449
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:00,351
Listen, what would be
really helpful is

450
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:03,354
turning feelings into something,
like a weapon.

451
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:07,191
Well, I think I know
just the class.

452
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,960
You do? Wonderful.

453
00:17:08,962 --> 00:17:10,895
Great.

454
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:12,330
Come on, child.

455
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:19,570
And you want to look
through our ledgers... why?

456
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:21,539
Because we want to know
if Debbie was telling the truth

457
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,940
about the missing donation,

458
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:25,743
and it could tie into
the motive for the murder.

459
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:27,945
(sobs)

460
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:29,347
I knew it.

461
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:32,050
(sobbing):
You got me.

462
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:34,986
No need to look
at the books. I did it.

463
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:38,322
The donation never made it
into the school account.

464
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:40,058
I cashed the check.

465
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,392
You stole the money?

466
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,094
Why?
I guess I was

467
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:45,496
tired of feeling
like I didn't belong.

468
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:47,498
Starford seemed so

469
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,734
nonjudgmental and inclusive.

470
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,602
But I'm-I'm under
a lot of pressure

471
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:52,937
to look a certain way,

472
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:55,640
drive a certain car.

473
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:58,910
And my salary
barely covers my rent.

474
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:01,079
Okay, so Debbie found out
that you took

475
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:02,580
Jon and Craig's donation money

476
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,249
and... did you kill her?

477
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:08,286
What? No, no.

478
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:12,657
Debbie assumed the parents
never extended the check.

479
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:14,192
They called her a liar,

480
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:17,962
got so upset,
and they killed her.

481
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:20,465
But I'm to blame.

482
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:22,600
I'm sorry.

483
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:23,935
DAN:
Look, we're not

484
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:28,272
real sure if Jon and Craig
killed Debbie.

485
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,941
Really?

486
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:34,345
(sniffles)

487
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:35,680
Oh.

488
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:39,283
If it's not related
to the murders, after all, um,

489
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:43,688
perhaps we could
disregard...

490
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,389
that last exchange.

491
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:47,692
Uh, is everything okay in here?

492
00:18:47,694 --> 00:18:49,227
Sounded like a child was crying.

493
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:52,964
We're just asking the
assistant dean some questions.

494
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:54,699
Uh, I am Detective Decker.
This is Detective...

495
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:56,801
Oh, you're Trixie's
cop-mom, aren't you?

496
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,402
That's a great
kid you've got.

497
00:18:58,404 --> 00:19:00,404
Thank you.
H-How do you know...

498
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:01,839
How do you know my daughter?

499
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:03,141
She's in Madison's
class right now.

500
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:04,475
Yeah, her father
brought her in.

501
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:08,012
Um... I'm pretty sure
he didn't.

502
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:11,983
Uh, can you finish
getting the statement, please,

503
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:14,152
and I'll see whatever
the hell Lucifer is doing.

504
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:17,321
But the good news is
bad feelings can be

505
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:19,657
harnessed into
good actions.

506
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:22,460
My son Ranger knows this.
Right, Ranger?

507
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:28,533
Would anyone else like to try?

508
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:30,234
Yeah.

509
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:31,836
Would any of the<i> children </i>
like to volunteer?

510
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:33,171
(Lucifer sighs)

511
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:36,674
For a progressive school,
it's rather ageist.

512
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,510
Trixie.

513
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,012
Do you have feelings
you want to use?

514
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:42,713
I know it's only your
first time, but...

515
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:45,550
I feel sad.

516
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:47,518
Okay, why?
Because...

517
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,520
my mommy almost died.

518
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:52,456
Her job is scary.

519
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,358
But she has helped
so many other people

520
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,027
with their problems,

521
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,696
I don't want her
to worry about mine.

522
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:02,633
So I pretend I'm okay.

523
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:04,135
Well...

524
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:07,371
welcome to the club
of parental deceit, child.

525
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:08,739
It's a lonely place,

526
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:11,275
but, uh, that's the price
of being clever.

527
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:15,379
Okay, now what?

528
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:18,583
How does one control
that juvenile angst usefully?

529
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:22,153
Trixie can channel
her strong feelings

530
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:24,055
into something productive.

531
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:26,090
Okay, go on.

532
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:28,893
For example,
she could...

533
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,061
write a poem.

534
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:31,162
A poem?

535
00:20:31,164 --> 00:20:32,496
I came here
to learn how

536
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:35,499
to turn emotions into energy,
not to become Dr. Seuss.

537
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:37,602
Well, creative energy is energy.

538
00:20:37,604 --> 00:20:39,804
Oh, come on. If I wanted
to attend an art class,

539
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:41,405
I would have at least
had the sense

540
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:42,740
to take one with a nude model.

541
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,276
I suppose you're channeling
emotional despair

542
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:47,845
over not getting dessert
before your veggies, are you?

543
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:51,816
No. This is a picture of
my mommy stabbing Debbie.

544
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:56,220
Lucifer.

545
00:20:57,957 --> 00:20:59,657
Detective.

546
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:01,125
Right, before you chastise me

547
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:02,760
for kidnapping
your offspring,

548
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,263
I've solved the case.

549
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:09,533
Okay, the boy's mother
is Joy Sherman.

550
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:11,202
This is her contact info.

551
00:21:11,204 --> 00:21:12,770
Okay, I'll look into it.

552
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:13,771
Is Trixie okay?

553
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,640
I'll talk to her.

554
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:17,541
I'll see you at
the station, okay?

555
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:19,377
Yeah.

556
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:23,981
Ah, Detective.

557
00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:25,783
You need to understand,
I'm dealing with

558
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,285
a most challenging issue...

559
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:29,520
Yeah, I want to talk to my
daughter for a second.

560
00:21:29,522 --> 00:21:30,788
Please don't be mad at him.

561
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,390
I should be the one
in trouble.

562
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:35,493
Oh... I'm not mad at you.

563
00:21:35,495 --> 00:21:36,961
You're not in
trouble, Monkey.

564
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:38,796
I do want you to know

565
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,799
you can talk to me
if something's going on.

566
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:42,800
I know.

567
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,001
You know that?

568
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:46,304
You want to talk
about something now?

569
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:48,706
I could tell you anything?

570
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,274
Yes.

571
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:54,145
I'd like to ride with Lucifer.

572
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:55,980
I promise
I'll make him take me

573
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:58,282
to my actual school this time.

574
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:02,053
Huh.

575
00:22:02,055 --> 00:22:04,622
Um, yeah, okay.

576
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,728
You are lucky my daughter
likes you so much.

577
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:13,731
Yes, I'm starting to respect
the deceptive little parasite.

578
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:15,099
(chuckles)
Oh, well, that's nice.

579
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:17,702
Speaking of, a deal's a deal.

580
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:18,803
What?

581
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:22,673
CHLOE:
Oh, no.

582
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:26,177
I... (sighs)

583
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:27,945
Driving lessons
will have to wait

584
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:29,880
until your mum's not looking.

585
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:31,649
CHLOE: Bye, babe.
(engine starts)

586
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,090
(sighs):
Oh, kids.

587
00:22:41,561 --> 00:22:42,593
Ah.

588
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:44,695
Wonderful, a mugger.
(chuckles)

589
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:47,798
Come on, then.
I fancy a bit of exercise

590
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,866
after a frustrating day.

591
00:22:58,211 --> 00:22:59,677
(shouts)

592
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:09,787
Mum?

593
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:12,556
Let me see the blade.
Anything?

594
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:15,226
Since when can
you hit so hard?

595
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:18,195
My strength has been
growing steadily.

596
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:19,463
As is your recklessness,
it seems.

597
00:23:19,465 --> 00:23:21,332
I mean, what did you
expect me to do?

598
00:23:21,334 --> 00:23:24,368
Stab you with the blade and
have it be ignited by my joy?

599
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,003
I was trying
to get you worked up.

600
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:27,371
Anger and awakening

601
00:23:27,373 --> 00:23:29,707
your sexual instincts
didn't work.
I...

602
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:33,377
I thought maybe if you were
afraid for your life...

603
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:34,712
Well, if you really
wanted to upset me,

604
00:23:34,714 --> 00:23:36,580
you should have just thrown me
into the Corvette.

605
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:37,882
Don't...

606
00:23:37,884 --> 00:23:40,718
throw me into
the Corvette.

607
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,487
Just trust me, Mum.
I'm dealing with this.

608
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:45,489
Clearly, not fast enough.

609
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:46,757
Why are you so angry?

610
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:47,992
I'm not angry!

611
00:23:47,994 --> 00:23:49,727
Yes, you are.

612
00:23:49,729 --> 00:23:50,861
Just...

613
00:23:50,863 --> 00:23:53,664
really need to get home,
where we belong.

614
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:54,799
Soon.

615
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:03,174
Hey, Chlo, we got that
kid's mom in inter...

616
00:24:03,176 --> 00:24:05,509
What's wrong?

617
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:08,379
Look at this e-mail.

618
00:24:08,381 --> 00:24:10,181
Why are you being invited
to a "grieving gathering"

619
00:24:10,183 --> 00:24:11,582
at Starford Academy?

620
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:13,017
'Cause Trixie's being
considered for admission.

621
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:15,352
Apparently, she impressed
some of the teachers there.

622
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:16,954
Or they were impressed with
Lucifer's bank account.

623
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,589
It's probably the only
thing they care about

624
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:19,757
at that
pretentious place.

625
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:21,025
Well, I mean,

626
00:24:21,027 --> 00:24:22,760
it is non-traditional,
that's for sure.

627
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:24,428
Wait, are you actually
considering it?

628
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,564
Uh...
I mean, don't you think
that with the divorce

629
00:24:26,566 --> 00:24:28,299
and the move and everything
that Trixie's had enough

630
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:30,034
big changes lately?
Exactly.

631
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:32,036
Trixie's pretending
that she's fine, Dan.

632
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:35,272
One morning at Starford,
and she's been opening up

633
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:38,042
like I haven't been able
to get her to do for months.

634
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:41,412
You didn't see her.
Yeah, well,

635
00:24:41,414 --> 00:24:43,113
it kills me to think
that she, uh,

636
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:45,149
she's been keeping up an act
just to protect us.

637
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:47,651
When did our kid
get so adult?

638
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,954
She does still hide chocolate
cake under the bed, though.

639
00:24:49,956 --> 00:24:51,055
Yeah, well, thank God for that.

640
00:24:51,057 --> 00:24:52,490
Okay, well,

641
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:54,792
maybe we can consider sending
our daughter to that school

642
00:24:54,794 --> 00:24:57,394
after we've solved the ongoing
murder investigation there.

643
00:24:59,098 --> 00:25:01,065
DAN: Can you
explain to us why

644
00:25:01,067 --> 00:25:02,833
your son would draw this,
Ms. Sherman?

645
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:06,170
I'm not sure
what it even is.

646
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:08,339
He says it's you killing Debbie.

647
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:11,275
Oh, he was listening to me.
(chuckles)

648
00:25:11,277 --> 00:25:13,777
He never listens to me.

649
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:15,479
So you said
that you killed Debbie?

650
00:25:15,481 --> 00:25:18,849
No, I-I said
I wanted to kill her.

651
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,185
Every morning,
while peeling the sticker off

652
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:23,487
some root vegetable
I got at the supermarket

653
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:25,322
for a third of the price
of the organic crap.

654
00:25:25,324 --> 00:25:27,458
Rubbing it in dirt
works like a charm, by the way.

655
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,592
Hmm.

656
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:29,793
Why would you say that to him?

657
00:25:29,795 --> 00:25:33,197
Because I'm single
and I work full-time,

658
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:34,932
and Debbie had
a million little ways

659
00:25:34,934 --> 00:25:37,434
of making me feel like
a bad mom because of it.

660
00:25:37,436 --> 00:25:39,436
For working?
Yeah.

661
00:25:39,438 --> 00:25:43,207
Well, that sounds like
a great environment.

662
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:45,776
Apparently,
I wasn't "involved enough."

663
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:47,845
Like, I'm sorry
that my bake sale cupcakes

664
00:25:47,847 --> 00:25:50,314
weren't gluten
and dairy free, Debbie.

665
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:51,982
Joy, where were you
two nights ago?

666
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:54,718
Tuesday?

667
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,886
Mm-hmm.

668
00:25:57,456 --> 00:26:00,491
Um, I was,
I was with Mr. Taylor.

669
00:26:00,493 --> 00:26:01,625
CHLOE:
Mr. Taylor?

670
00:26:01,627 --> 00:26:04,295
The wellness mentor?
What were you doing?

671
00:26:04,297 --> 00:26:06,997
We weren't discussing
the French New Wave.

672
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:08,499
Oh.
DAN: So you're
having an affair

673
00:26:08,501 --> 00:26:09,967
with the...

674
00:26:09,969 --> 00:26:11,402
with the
P.E. teacher.

675
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:13,537
JOY:
Only on Tuesday nights.

676
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:15,639
He had a busy schedule.

677
00:26:17,143 --> 00:26:19,143
Look, every mom
at Starford knows

678
00:26:19,145 --> 00:26:20,578
that the movement
and wellness program

679
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,746
is one of the best benefits
of the school.

680
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:26,383
I mean, the man is
as dumb as a box of hair,

681
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:30,321
but he does know how to move.

682
00:26:30,323 --> 00:26:32,489
CHLOE: While I check
into your alibi, uh,

683
00:26:32,491 --> 00:26:34,258
can you tell us, are
there any other people

684
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,360
that you can think of that
had a grudge against Debbie?

685
00:26:36,362 --> 00:26:37,995
Are you, are you kidding?

686
00:26:37,997 --> 00:26:40,331
Who didn't hate the Wicked Witch
of the Westside?

687
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:43,167
She held the keys to the most
exclusive school in the city,

688
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:45,402
and she never let
anyone forget it.

689
00:26:45,404 --> 00:26:47,504
We were told that
she was very well loved.

690
00:26:47,506 --> 00:26:48,839
(laughs)

691
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:51,342
Well, the hairlines
and the perky boobs

692
00:26:51,344 --> 00:26:52,710
aren't the only phony things

693
00:26:52,712 --> 00:26:53,877
at that school.

694
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:55,713
You want to know who killed her?

695
00:26:55,715 --> 00:26:59,049
You should go to that grieving
gathering they're throwing.

696
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:01,085
All her frenemies will be there.

697
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:11,028
(mumbling quietly)

698
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,630
(snaps fingers)

699
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:15,366
Never seen you so worried
about an outfit, Decker.

700
00:27:15,368 --> 00:27:18,302
Not picking up the first
coat off the floor as usual?

701
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:20,037
Nope.

702
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:21,372
No, I'm not.

703
00:27:21,374 --> 00:27:22,973
I am going

704
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:24,608
to a grieving gathering
at the school,

705
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:27,978
and, well, you should see
the other parents.

706
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,213
They are very fancy.

707
00:27:29,215 --> 00:27:30,914
It's...

708
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:32,549
(sniffs)
You know what?

709
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:34,251
Never mind. I don't
want to make you sick

710
00:27:34,253 --> 00:27:35,619
with my feelings.
No.

711
00:27:35,621 --> 00:27:37,087
Come on. I'm
listening, I promise.

712
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:38,355
No more earbuds.

713
00:27:42,395 --> 00:27:44,561
Okay, Trixie might get into
this private school,

714
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:46,597
and it could be
really, really good for her.

715
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:48,065
But it's super exclusive,

716
00:27:48,067 --> 00:27:50,901
and I'm not sure that I want her
in that kind of environment.

717
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:53,904
That's what you're
so worried about?

718
00:27:53,906 --> 00:27:55,239
Mm-hmm.
All right.

719
00:27:55,241 --> 00:27:56,907
A school like that
is great for Trixie.

720
00:27:56,909 --> 00:27:58,008
You think so?

721
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:58,942
Yeah.

722
00:27:58,944 --> 00:28:00,477
Fancy-pants rich kids?

723
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:01,745
They're like vipers, okay?

724
00:28:01,747 --> 00:28:03,747
Trixie will learn
to slash them with her words.

725
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:06,684
Then I will teach her
the knives.

726
00:28:06,686 --> 00:28:08,819
Oh, okay.

727
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:10,821
I think-- I know
you're trying to help,

728
00:28:10,823 --> 00:28:12,256
but, uh, I don't think

729
00:28:12,258 --> 00:28:14,558
you can help me with...
with this now.

730
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:21,665
♪ I'm counting bones
of your casualties ♪

731
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:23,133

Hi. (clears throat)

733
00:28:24,303 --> 00:28:26,603
Uh, Chloe Decker.
Uh, Trixie's mom.

734
00:28:26,605 --> 00:28:29,073
Just you?

735
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:31,141
Alone?

736
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:33,510
Just me, alone.

737
00:28:33,512 --> 00:28:34,545
Yeah.
(chuckles nervously)

738
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:35,813
WOMAN:
Aw.

739
00:28:35,815 --> 00:28:37,614
That must be difficult.

740
00:28:37,616 --> 00:28:40,084
Actually,
she's with me.

741
00:28:43,956 --> 00:28:46,290
Oh. Two mommies?

742
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:48,125
Oh, hell yeah.

743
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:50,461
Um...
Trixie's a handful,

744
00:28:50,463 --> 00:28:52,963
definitely
a two-woman job.

745
00:28:52,965 --> 00:28:54,331
Right, honey?

746
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:55,966
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

00:28:58,637 --> 00:28:59,603

CHLOE:
What are you doing here?

750
00:29:05,945 --> 00:29:08,512
Look, I'm not good
at listening.

751
00:29:08,514 --> 00:29:11,115
Or talking about
emotion stuff.

752
00:29:11,117 --> 00:29:13,083
But I do know you
don't let your girl

753
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:15,586
go into enemy
territory alone.

754
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:16,720
Thank you.

755
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:21,692
Oh, wow.

756
00:29:21,694 --> 00:29:24,161
I guess networking
is the new grieving.

757
00:29:24,163 --> 00:29:25,162
MAZE:
Mm-hmm.

758
00:29:26,699 --> 00:29:29,199
You're Trixie's moms, right?

759
00:29:29,201 --> 00:29:31,268
Mm.
I'm the event
coordinator here.

760
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,870
I just wanted to tell you

761
00:29:32,872 --> 00:29:36,106
that we'd be so happy to
have you as part of the family.

762
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:38,675
Mid-afternoon yoga
always needs more volunteers.

763
00:29:38,677 --> 00:29:39,877
(giggles)
Oh.

764
00:29:39,879 --> 00:29:41,111
I would love to,
but mid-afternoons,

765
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,279
I'm at my job.

766
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,614
Oh.
Yeah.

767
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:45,616
She's a homicide detective.

768
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:46,817
Oh.

769
00:29:46,819 --> 00:29:48,352
She has a gun
and everything.

770
00:29:48,354 --> 00:29:49,353
(woman chuckles)

771
00:29:49,355 --> 00:29:51,321
A real pistol in
the sack, too.

772
00:29:51,323 --> 00:29:52,790
(woman laughs)
Oh!

773
00:29:52,792 --> 00:29:54,358
(chuckles) Jokester.

774
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,059
I wish I had time for a job.

775
00:29:56,061 --> 00:29:57,461
But you know what they say:

776
00:29:57,463 --> 00:30:00,631
exceptional child,
exhausted mom.

777
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:01,865
(giggles)

778
00:30:01,867 --> 00:30:03,200
Mm-hmm.

779
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,303
I've never heard
anyone say that.

780
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:08,739
(scoffs)
Doesn't makes sense.

781
00:30:08,741 --> 00:30:11,208
Maze, look at everybody.
Look at these parents.

782
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:13,243
Who has a kid and is
this put together?

783
00:30:13,245 --> 00:30:14,812
Use those detective
skills, Decker.

784
00:30:14,814 --> 00:30:16,814
Get out of your own
head. Look around.

785
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:17,815
All right.

786
00:30:17,817 --> 00:30:19,716
That entire table
over there

787
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:21,919
is just waiting
for that couple to go nuclear.

788
00:30:21,921 --> 00:30:24,354
(chuckles)
Oh, when that
woman walked in,

789
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:27,191
the entire room started
commenting on her cheek-filler.

790
00:30:27,193 --> 00:30:29,059
Hmm.
They're miserable.

791
00:30:29,061 --> 00:30:30,727
And waiting to tear
each other apart.

792
00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:33,163
Actually...

793
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:34,998
reminds me of home.

794
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,401
Hmm.

795
00:30:37,403 --> 00:30:40,337
You know what?
You're right.

796
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:42,706
They love gossip.

797
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:45,542
And the juicier,
the better.

798
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:46,910
You know what?

799
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:48,979
Let's give them something
to talk about.

800
00:30:51,217 --> 00:30:53,050
Don't do that.

801
00:30:53,052 --> 00:30:55,886
♪ Am I thinking
what I think I'm feeling? ♪

802
00:30:55,888 --> 00:30:59,122

Careful, brother.

809
00:31:12,905 --> 00:31:15,739
Too much of that
will make you go blind.

810
00:31:15,741 --> 00:31:18,041
Mom was right.

811
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:21,411
I can't make it work.

812
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:22,880
Ah, I see. You're up here

813
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:25,148
practicing a different kind
of self-flagellation, are you?

814
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,584
Hoping for
a celestial spark?

815
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:29,086
You don't even
have your powers.

816
00:31:29,088 --> 00:31:31,221
Yeah, thanks for
that reminder, Luci.

817
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:33,390
You know, I also don't seem

818
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,592
to have much of
Mom's attention anymore.

819
00:31:35,594 --> 00:31:37,928
Because, unlike you,

820
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:41,999
I don't have some glorious
destiny to wield the sword.

821
00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:43,433
(sighs)
And what's so great

822
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:44,902
about Mum's attention?

823
00:31:44,904 --> 00:31:47,004
She nearly killed me
in the car park earlier,

824
00:31:47,006 --> 00:31:49,606
trying to help me
achieve that destiny.

825
00:31:49,608 --> 00:31:51,642
Oh, good job warning me she's
strong enough to lift a house,

826
00:31:51,644 --> 00:31:52,643
by the way.

827
00:31:52,645 --> 00:31:54,845
Same old Luci,
always the victim.

828
00:31:54,847 --> 00:31:57,614
Can't you just be
grateful for once?

829
00:31:57,616 --> 00:31:58,682
You're the Lightbringer!

830
00:31:58,684 --> 00:31:59,750
Am I?

831
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:01,184
Am I, indeed?

832
00:32:01,186 --> 00:32:03,153
'Cause so far,
it's just Mum's word against,

833
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:04,755
well, reality.

834
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,292
What if she's wrong, brother?

835
00:32:08,294 --> 00:32:10,661
She's been acting
very odd recently.

836
00:32:10,663 --> 00:32:12,329
On edge.

837
00:32:12,331 --> 00:32:13,830
This obsession
with getting home,

838
00:32:13,832 --> 00:32:15,499
it's a bit much,
don't you think?

839
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:17,768
(scoffs)

840
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:20,871
You see, I thought
we all wanted to go back.

841
00:32:20,873 --> 00:32:22,339
You know I don't lie, brother.

842
00:32:22,341 --> 00:32:25,876
So trust me when I say
nothing would make me happier

843
00:32:25,878 --> 00:32:27,878
than Mum getting her wish.

844
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,114
Then you need to stop
fighting this, Luci,

845
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:32,349
and find a way

846
00:32:32,351 --> 00:32:34,217
to get the sword to work.

847
00:32:34,219 --> 00:32:37,688
Because whether
we like it or not,

848
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,790
it is all on you.

849
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:41,758
Lightbringer.

850
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:51,168
You, uh, call
this pâté, huh?

851
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,003
(chuckles)
I know, right?

852
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:54,972
You know, say what you will
about Debbie,

853
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:57,274
but that woman knew
how to cater a party.

854
00:32:58,844 --> 00:33:00,844
You're married
to that cop, right?

855
00:33:00,846 --> 00:33:03,146
Yeah.

856
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:05,315
Actually,
can you keep a secret?

857
00:33:07,386 --> 00:33:09,419
My wife is very close

858
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:11,822
to making an arrest.

859
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:14,624
We think the killer
might actually be here.

860
00:33:16,028 --> 00:33:18,395
She found evidence
just tonight.

861
00:33:18,397 --> 00:33:19,596
DNA.

862
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:21,865
It's in the car right now.

863
00:33:21,867 --> 00:33:26,670
Somebody here is going to jail.

864
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:31,208
Oh, but keep that on
the DL, all right?

865
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:32,175
Knuckles.

866
00:33:39,218 --> 00:33:40,350
(gasps)

867
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:43,587
Five gossips down,
a couple more to be safe.

868
00:33:45,924 --> 00:33:48,358
No, look,
this is plenty.

869
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,361
Let's hope
they take the bait.

870
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,363
Okay, all I have
to do now

871
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:56,033
is stake out the car;
if the killer is here,

872
00:33:56,035 --> 00:33:57,801
they'll go out there
for the evidence.

873
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:08,712
Ah.

874
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:10,647
Just the person
I'm looking for.

875
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:12,549
Mr. Morningstar.
Yes.

876
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:14,885
Look, I'm willing to give
your Kumbaya curriculum

877
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:16,386
a second look.

878
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:18,722
Perhaps if I'm more specific
about what I want out of it:

879
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:20,724
uh, less
watercolors,

880
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:22,926
more, sort of, heavenly flames?

881
00:34:22,928 --> 00:34:24,661
Are you
following me?

882
00:34:24,663 --> 00:34:26,763
Sorry, do you need something
out of the detective's car?

883
00:34:26,765 --> 00:34:29,332
Uh, uh, yeah, she-she asked me
to grab something for her.

884
00:34:29,334 --> 00:34:30,333
Ah.

885
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:31,902
Well, let's get that over with,

886
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:33,737
so we can focus on
what's important: me.

887
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:34,738
(chuckles)

888
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,573
(car alarm chirps)

889
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:39,609
Uh, don't tell her I,
uh, got a copy made.

890
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:42,579
She gets all fussy about
things like illegal duplicates.

891
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,081
So, uh, do you do
private tutoring?

892
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:46,316
'Cause I'm free
most of the time.

893
00:34:46,318 --> 00:34:47,684
Specifically now.

894
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:49,119
Yeah.

895
00:34:49,121 --> 00:34:51,788
Lucifer,
what are you doing?

896
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:54,024
Uh, Madison said she needed
something from your car.

897
00:34:54,026 --> 00:34:55,492
What?

898
00:34:55,494 --> 00:34:56,827
She's the killer.

899
00:34:56,829 --> 00:34:59,196
(chuckles)
That's quite a leap, Detective.

900
00:34:59,198 --> 00:35:00,730
No, it isn't.
Lucifer, please, she...

901
00:35:04,136 --> 00:35:06,937
My gun's in the car.

902
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:09,806
Well, why didn't you
tell me all this earlier?

903
00:35:09,808 --> 00:35:11,775
Put your hands up.
(sighs)

904
00:35:16,482 --> 00:35:18,515
MADISON:
Stay back!

905
00:35:19,585 --> 00:35:21,585
Stay back!
Madison,

906
00:35:21,587 --> 00:35:23,386
put down the gun.
Yes.

907
00:35:23,388 --> 00:35:24,788
Perhaps if you
channel your feelings

908
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,056
into something
other than bullets,

909
00:35:26,058 --> 00:35:27,524
that might...

910
00:35:27,526 --> 00:35:28,658
(yelping)
Okay.

911
00:35:30,262 --> 00:35:31,728
I said stay back!

912
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,763
Okay, got it.

913
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,166
Oh, you!

914
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,903
This is all your fault!

915
00:35:39,905 --> 00:35:41,238
With your stupid

916
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,740
handsome face
and your chiseled abs

917
00:35:43,742 --> 00:35:44,941
and your huge...

918
00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:47,244
You slept with the
P.E. teacher, too?

919
00:35:47,246 --> 00:35:49,646
Well, the movement and wellness
mentor, Detective, but...

920
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:52,816
CHLOE: Madison, if I've
learned anything here tonight,

921
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:55,452
it's that everyone here
has secrets.

922
00:35:55,454 --> 00:35:56,620
No one's perfect.

923
00:35:56,622 --> 00:35:57,988
Okay?

924
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,923
But we didn't have sex.
(gasps)

925
00:35:59,925 --> 00:36:01,224
Well, I mean, okay, one time.

926
00:36:01,226 --> 00:36:02,893
But, come on, that was,
like, years ago.

927
00:36:02,895 --> 00:36:04,661
One time was all it took.

928
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:07,898
This is about your son,
isn't it?

929
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,232
LUCIFER: What?
You mean the boy

930
00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:11,334
in the class with the special
diet of boogers and paste?

931
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:12,335
Lucifer.

932
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:13,336
I...

933
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:15,172
MADISON:
God knows I love Ranger,

934
00:36:15,174 --> 00:36:18,575
but he's not very smart.

935
00:36:18,577 --> 00:36:20,310
My husband is,

936
00:36:20,312 --> 00:36:23,079
and that witch Debbie
put two and two together.

937
00:36:23,081 --> 00:36:25,015
And she told you
that she was gonna

938
00:36:25,017 --> 00:36:27,150
expose Mr. Taylor as Ranger's

939
00:36:27,152 --> 00:36:28,351
real father.

940
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:30,253
She hated how
all the moms loved him.

941
00:36:30,255 --> 00:36:32,455
My husband
would've left me.

942
00:36:32,457 --> 00:36:34,024
Madison, I understand.

943
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:35,825
You were just thinking
of your son's future.

944
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:38,028
I-I get it. I-I'm a mother, too.

945
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,630
Um, maybe you remember
Trixie, my daughter.

946
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:41,932
Th-The little girl who was sad

947
00:36:41,934 --> 00:36:43,800
because her mom had
such a scary job.

948
00:36:43,802 --> 00:36:45,368
That's me. She's my daughter.

949
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,637
So, please,

950
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:50,507
Madison, put
down the gun.

951
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,947
I'm so sorry.

952
00:36:56,949 --> 00:36:58,648
I-I got so angry,

953
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,450
I couldn't control myself.

954
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:01,685
What? Hold on.

955
00:37:01,687 --> 00:37:03,653
All this talk about
controlling your emotions

956
00:37:03,655 --> 00:37:07,490
and harnessing them for creation
was all just a sham?

957
00:37:07,492 --> 00:37:09,693
I tried so hard to make it real.

958
00:37:09,695 --> 00:37:10,961
(sighs)

959
00:37:10,963 --> 00:37:12,495
We can't control our emotions.

960
00:37:12,497 --> 00:37:14,231
We just have to keep try...

961
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:15,899
(Madison screams)

962
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:17,867
(crowd gasps)

963
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:21,171
(panting)

964
00:37:21,173 --> 00:37:24,507
Listening to feelings,
it's not my thing.

965
00:37:24,509 --> 00:37:25,976
Right, honey?

966
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:29,079
You know,
if I were you,

967
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:30,981
I'd take my child
out of this school.

968
00:37:30,983 --> 00:37:31,948
Terrible place.

969
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:35,018
Wait.

970
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,453
I'm a father?

971
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:41,324
(laughs):
That's awesome.

972
00:37:45,831 --> 00:37:47,797
(softly):
Here you go.

973
00:37:50,402 --> 00:37:52,168
How cute this guy is.

974
00:37:54,573 --> 00:37:56,439
So...

975
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:59,109
I went back to
that school today.

976
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:01,778
And I think they'd let you
in if you wanted to go.

977
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,813
So how do you
feel about that?

978
00:38:05,751 --> 00:38:08,818
Well, can I tell you how
it made me feel being there?

979
00:38:09,855 --> 00:38:11,288
Well, at first,

980
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:15,191
it made me feel
insecure and worried.

981
00:38:15,193 --> 00:38:17,761
I mean, the school is so fancy,

982
00:38:17,763 --> 00:38:20,697
and all the other mommies
seemed so perfect.

983
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:22,565
But guess what I found out.

984
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:23,566
What?

985
00:38:23,568 --> 00:38:25,969
That the other mommies,

986
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:28,805
they were just as worried
as I was.

987
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:31,408
And they were just
pretending to be perfect.

988
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:34,477
Is it bad to pretend?

989
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,880
No, not always, Monkey.

990
00:38:36,882 --> 00:38:40,050
I mean, sometimes
people feel like...

991
00:38:40,052 --> 00:38:42,452
(sighs)

992
00:38:42,454 --> 00:38:44,721
...like they have to pretend
that everything's okay.

993
00:38:44,723 --> 00:38:46,222
But--

994
00:38:46,224 --> 00:38:50,060
and this is
the most important part--

995
00:38:50,062 --> 00:38:51,728
you and me,

996
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,663
we never have to

997
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:56,032
pretend with each other.
(sniffles)

998
00:38:59,104 --> 00:39:01,838
I really didn't
like that school.

999
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,840
(whispers):
I didn't like it either.

1000
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:05,075
(chuckles)

1001
00:39:08,647 --> 00:39:10,647
Thanks for
telling me, Monkey.

1002
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:19,255
It turns out
you were right, Doctor.

1003
00:39:19,257 --> 00:39:22,092
It's impossible to
control your feelings.

1004
00:39:22,094 --> 00:39:24,494
And anyone who does risks
turning into a murderous lunatic

1005
00:39:24,496 --> 00:39:26,830
with a child of below-average
intelligence, so...

1006
00:39:26,832 --> 00:39:28,598
Yeah, well, I'm sure

1007
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,434
at least some of that,
that's inaccurate.

1008
00:39:31,436 --> 00:39:33,269
But I'm glad
you've come around.

1009
00:39:34,806 --> 00:39:38,174
Are you ready to be
more forthcoming now?

1010
00:39:38,176 --> 00:39:39,376
(sighs)

1011
00:39:39,378 --> 00:39:41,544
Yes, I suppose.

1012
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:44,214
If that's what it takes
to get you to help me.

1013
00:39:44,216 --> 00:39:46,383
So...

1014
00:39:46,385 --> 00:39:47,851
um...

1015
00:39:47,853 --> 00:39:50,286
I wasn't lying before,
obviously.

1016
00:39:50,288 --> 00:39:52,722
I do intend to use
the Flaming Sword

1017
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,624
to cut through
the Gates of Heaven.

1018
00:39:54,626 --> 00:39:56,159
But what you left out...?

1019
00:39:56,161 --> 00:39:57,994
Is that once I do that,

1020
00:39:57,996 --> 00:40:00,196
I plan on kicking Mum
into Heaven

1021
00:40:00,198 --> 00:40:02,632
and slamming the gates
on her backside.

1022
00:40:02,634 --> 00:40:04,968
But she'll be
trapped there,

1023
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:07,137
on her own.

1024
00:40:07,139 --> 00:40:08,805
Won't God destroy her?

1025
00:40:08,807 --> 00:40:10,974
Hopefully, they
tear each other apart.

1026
00:40:10,976 --> 00:40:12,809
Then they'll both get
what they deserve.

1027
00:40:12,811 --> 00:40:13,910
What's that?

1028
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:15,678
Punishment.

1029
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,414
For manipulating me.

1030
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:18,982
I mean, Dad set a trap for me,

1031
00:40:18,984 --> 00:40:21,317
but Mum was the one who made
sure that I fell into it.

1032
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:24,454
She was the one
that made sure that I felt...

1033
00:40:26,258 --> 00:40:28,691
...that I...

1034
00:40:28,693 --> 00:40:31,261
that I felt things that
I don't want to feel anymore.

1035
00:40:31,263 --> 00:40:32,529
That, right there,

1036
00:40:32,531 --> 00:40:36,499
that what you stopped
yourself from feeling,

1037
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:38,268
that's exactly
what you need to feel.

1038
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,536
What, the anger?

1039
00:40:39,538 --> 00:40:41,037
Oh, I feel it.

1040
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:43,940
Not the anger.

1041
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:45,275
The pain.

1042
00:40:45,277 --> 00:40:47,544
That's what you've
been suppressing.

1043
00:40:47,546 --> 00:40:51,114
All the pain and heartbreak

1044
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:53,483
that you have over
what happened with your mother.

1045
00:40:56,354 --> 00:40:58,421
And Chloe.

1046
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:05,195
I know it's difficult.

1047
00:41:05,197 --> 00:41:07,764
But the only way
to get over that pain...

1048
00:41:07,766 --> 00:41:09,098
(chuckles softly)

1049
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,534
...is to go through it.

1050
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:18,241
AMENADIEL:<i> So you think</i>
<i> you've figured it out?</i>

1051
00:41:18,243 --> 00:41:19,876
Yes.

1052

And you're sure
this time?

1053

Just...

That's it?!

00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:16,366
You have to try harder.

1062
00:42:16,368 --> 00:42:18,001
What?
Try harder!

1063
00:42:18,003 --> 00:42:20,537
Mom! That's enough!

1064
00:42:20,539 --> 00:42:22,138
I'm not broken.

1065
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,107
The sword must be.

1066
00:42:24,109 --> 00:42:25,508
Okay.

1067
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:26,676
Okay, then we'll fix it.

1068
00:42:26,678 --> 00:42:28,177
There's plenty of time.

1069
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:30,213
(chuckles)

1070
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:31,381
Of course.

1071
00:42:31,383 --> 00:42:33,049
You're right, son.

1072
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:35,985
There's plenty of time.

1073
00:42:35,987 --> 00:42:37,754
(scoffs)

1074
00:42:45,997 --> 00:42:47,964
(elevator bell dings)

1075
00:42:59,177 --> 00:43:01,978
(exhales)

1076
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,947
Just not for me.
