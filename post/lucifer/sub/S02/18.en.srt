the Flaming Sword

another piece missing.

8
00:00:14,582 --> 00:00:16,915

<i> of the Flaming Sword.</i>

9
00:00:16,917 --> 00:00:18,283
I went through a
lot this last year,

10
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:20,586

me reorient myself.

11
00:00:20,588 --> 00:00:21,987

told you about our trip

12
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:23,022

you're under arrest.

16
00:00:31,565 --> 00:00:35,200
Are you certain this is all that
was in the safety deposit box?

17
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:36,802
We'll fix it.
There's plenty of time.

18

MOM:
<i> Just not for me.</i>

19
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:41,340
God shattered the Flaming Sword

00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:20,172
Dr. Linda, I had no idea.

183
00:07:20,174 --> 00:07:21,873
(laughs)

184
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,475
What is that?

185
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:30,949
All right,
out with it, Mother.

186
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,517
It's nothing.

187
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,618
That spoiled brat,

188
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,620
Chet Ruiz, stabbed me,

189
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:36,922
and now I'm bleeding light.

190
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:39,157
It's... it's no big deal.

191
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,826
What?

192
00:07:40,828 --> 00:07:42,260
That's a huge deal.

193
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:44,663
Mum, if your powers are
returning to this degree,

194
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:47,632
then your human body won't be
able to contain it, you'll...

195
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:48,934
you'll burst.

196
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:50,469
Oh, no.

197
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:51,903
I need to find Amenadiel now.

198
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:53,238
I'd rather you didn't.

199
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,673
I mean, it's bad enough

200
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:55,907
that you'll be worried.
No, that's just it, Mum.

201
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:58,977
Amenadiel has the missing
piece of the sword.

202
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,912
You're k... you're kidding.

203
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:03,548
Son, why didn't
you say something?

204
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:07,219
Now we can finally ignite it and
cut through the Gates of Heaven

205
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:12,057
and I can see my... I can...
I can see my children.

206
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:16,561
Yes. Yes, but for now,
I need to find Amenadiel

207
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:18,497
and you need
to stay away from humans.

208

Uh, um, actually,

210
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:26,638
speaking of that, I...
may have already

211
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,542
harmed... someone.

Well, not to worry.
I had a pro clean up the mess.

219
00:08:45,241 --> 00:08:47,224
The detective is good,
annoyingly good.

220
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:49,861
Well, then we just need
to find Amenadiel, don't we?

221
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,796
Yes.
And get the piece.

222
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:53,398
Because if we don't
get you back to Heaven

223
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,733
before the detective
gets to you,

224

It's so frustrating.

Well, there is one
thing I'm waiting on.

295
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:57,549
But I thought you
just said we had nada.
Well,

296
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:58,717
so the only thing
we know for sure

297
00:11:58,719 --> 00:11:59,851
is that someone
had to drive there

298
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:01,419
to dump the body.

299
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:03,488
So, the tech team is checking
the vicinity for cameras,

300
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,858
but it's such a remote place,
so don't get your hopes up.

301

Ooh, yes. I think you're right,
Miss Lopez.

302
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:10,995
Sadly, the only witness
to this one

303
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:13,031
is my dear old dad.

Oh, right. Yes, your dad...
(clicks tongue)

305

306
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:22,073
Wait a second.
That gives me an idea.

307
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,274
It does?

308
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:25,477
Satellite imaging takes
sporadic photos of,

309
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:27,278
well, everything, so...

310
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,813
So there may be footage
of the killer

311
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:30,081

312
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:30,882

313
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:32,584

that God had lost faith in me,
but it was me.

320
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:46,831
I lost faith in him.

321
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,033
I can see that now.

322
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:54,973
That losing my powers
must have been a test.

323
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:59,911
And if so, I failed.

00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:02,580

So, uh, good job.

332
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:20,231

that we try to avoid:

333
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:22,667
you know, religion, politics,
anything too polarizing.

00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:23,668

00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:20,458
near the crime scene
between midnight and 5:00 a.m.

360
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,127
Yes, but how do you know this
parked van's even the same one?

361
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:25,029
I mean, there's no license
plates on this image.

362
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,832
Oh, come on! How many vans
have dandelions on the side?

363
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:30,735
They're not dandelions;
they're jellyfish.

364
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:32,604
What? Jellyfish?

365
00:14:32,606 --> 00:14:33,771
LUCIFER:
Right, yes.

366
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:35,240
Well, I'm simply saying that

367
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:36,708
we should be focusing on
more pressing criminal issues.

368
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,143
Such as?
Well, I'm glad you
asked, actually.

369
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:41,145
The death of
Celeste McDougall.

370
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:42,847
Very suspicious, indeed.

371
00:14:42,849 --> 00:14:45,283
She was 92.
Yes, and fit as a fiddle.

372
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:47,285
I mean, look at that
smug face. Look.
I know.

373
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:49,621
Yeah, I got it,
I got it.

374
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:51,356
LAPD!

375
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:53,858
Don't move!

376
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,960
You still think
we're wasting our time?

377
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:04,936
Definitely rethinking the
lasagna I had for lunch.

378
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:06,337
WOMAN:
Oh, my gosh.

379
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:08,139
This is not
what it looks like.

380
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:09,641
What? Minions day out?

381
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:12,110
Take your hoods off, slowly.

382
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:18,783
I know this looks bad,
but we can explain.

383
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:19,984
I'm Ava.

384
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:21,586
This is my sister Kathleen.

385
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:22,787
Hi. How ya doin'?

386
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:24,222
Friendliest serial killers ever.

387
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:27,058
AVA: Oh, that's hilarious.
We're not killers.

388
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,192
(laughs):
God, no.

389
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:29,928
We run Dandy
Lyon Cleaners.

390
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,863
Lyon's our last name.
Get it?

391
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:34,699
We take care of crime scenes,
dead body removals.

392
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:36,034
All the icky stuff.

393
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:37,602
But totally legit.

394
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:40,171
Yeah, like this poor guy,
died of a heart attack.

395
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:41,506
Like, two weeks ago.

396
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:42,874
Right, well, perfectly
good explanation.

397
00:15:42,876 --> 00:15:44,943
I knew it. Shall
we, Detective?
Wait, wait, wait.

398
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:46,277
Why was your van

399
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,613
outside of an abandoned
warehouse in Eagle Rock

400
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,081
at 3:00 a.m. last night?

401
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,784
I'm... pretty sure
you're mistaken.

402
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,552
We were nowhere
near that area.

403
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:56,087
Well...

404
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:58,423
Ugh, no. Eagle Rock.

405
00:15:58,425 --> 00:16:00,892
Do not tell me you went
to see Fred again.

406
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:02,393
I thought you were done
with that jerk.

407
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:05,029
I was, till I ran into
him at Jamba Juice.

408
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:06,364
LUCIFER:
Understand completely.

409
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:08,967
I mean, what's more intoxicating
than a Mango-A-Go-Go?

410
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:10,635
Alibi sorted.

411
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:13,004
We'll leave you here with Soupy,
and we'll be on our way.

412
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:14,405
Come on.
No. Wait, wait. Hold on.

413
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:15,940
Can I talk to you for a second?

414
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:17,475
Yes?
Enough with this.

415
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,210
Why are you trying to rush
our investigation?

416
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:21,512
Why are you still
hiding things from me

417
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:23,147
after all we've been through?

418
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,782
You know I don't
lie, Detective.

419
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:26,551
But you also don't
tell the whole truth.

420
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:28,119
Does this have to do

421
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:29,988
with what you were upset
about this morning,

422
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,089
with your family?

423
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:33,524
(sighs) Yes, but
I can't explain,

424
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:35,159
because you wouldn't
understand.

425
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,128
Not if you don't talk to me.

426
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,696
Never mind.

427
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:40,531
I thought
we were past this.

428
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:43,401
Going backwards, Lucifer,
is not good.

429
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:45,603
For anyone.

430
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,879
Trust me, dude, you're gonna
find this really freeing

431
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:56,514
once you get
the hang of it.

432
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,816
And I'll help
you through it.

433
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:00,885
Just takes practice.

434
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:02,754
You're a good man, Daniel.

435
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:04,422
(chuckles)
Yeah.

436
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,624
Ooh!

437
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:07,892
Okay.

438
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:09,627
All right.

439
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:11,162
Wow. You're strong.

440
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:13,231
(chuckles)

441
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:17,502
(quietly): That
family is so weird.

442
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:21,939
"You'll get
the hang of it."

443
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:23,474
"It just takes practice."

444
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:27,045
And that hug.

445
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,147
You guys doing it?

446
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:30,481
So, what are you
even doing here?

447
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:33,051
I'm bounty hunting you,
thanks to Lucifer.

448
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:35,453
Time to assemble
the sword, Amenadiel.

449
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:37,455
I don't know
that I want to, Maze.

450
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:39,323
Father entrusted me
with the final piece.

451
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:40,958
That changes things.

452
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,161
Are you coming with me or not?
Think about it,
Mazikeen.

453
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:46,264
All of my actions,
all of my feelings,

454
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:48,599
they were all
just based on lies.

455
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:50,334
You see, I thought
I had fallen, and I...

456
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,637
(Taser crackling)
(grunting)

457
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:56,674
I don't get paid by the hour.

458
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:58,209
(floor squeaks)

459
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:05,049
Oh, my God!
Are you going to Paris?

460
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:06,951
Can I be
your travel buddy?

461
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:08,486
I love Paris.

462
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:13,324
<i> Les hommes, oh, très sexy,</i>
<i> romantiques, avec... </i>

463
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:16,527
This is the Paris hotel
in Vegas, actually.

464
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:17,328
Oh.

465
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,597
Not... going there.

466
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,532
Vegas and me...

467
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:22,600
(whispers):
not pretty.

468
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,135
Yeah, I'm not
going, either.

469
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:25,503
But Kathleen Lyon's ex

470
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:27,538
Brad did, and according
to his Wobble page,

471
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,674
he's been partying there
all weekend.

472
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:31,476
Oh, well, that blows up

473
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:34,645
Kathleen's reason for being
in Eagle Rock at 3:00 a.m.

474
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:38,616
You think our two
sweet, "legit" cleaners

475
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,852
are up to something
not so legit?

476
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:49,460
Hello, Brother.

477
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,329
I notice you've
changed your look.

478
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:53,197
Where's your
pretty necklace?

479
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:55,266
Oh, I've put it
in a safe place.

480
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:57,368
Ah. Keister it, did you?

481
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,070
Nope. Already checked.

482
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:00,505
Not there.

483
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:01,572
Lovely.

484
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:02,740
Listen, Amenadiel,

485
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:04,926
I need the final piece.

486
00:19:04,927 --> 00:19:07,111
Right. So you and Mom can slice
through the Gates of Heaven

487
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:08,279
and destroy Father.

488
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:09,814
Yeah. I know.

489
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:11,115
(sighs):
Right.

490
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:12,283
Maze, darling,
would you mind

491
00:19:12,285 --> 00:19:14,385
running down to the wine cellar
and fetching Mum?

492
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:16,354
I think she'd like
to hear this.

493
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:22,660
I've been thinking
about this, deeply.

494
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:25,763
And I think that we've been
looking at things the wrong way.

495
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:26,564
Oh?

496
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:28,232
That necklace
was a gift.

497
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:29,867
It's not some
manipulation.

498
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:32,303
Well, you only think that
because it was gifted to<i> you.</i>

499
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:33,471
No, no, Luci!

500
00:19:33,473 --> 00:19:35,540
It's all about perspective.

501
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:37,308
Father doesn't
always make things clear,

502
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,710
because he wants us
to form our own beliefs.

503
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:43,080
And I strongly believe
that I am to guard that piece.

504
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:44,715
Now, I may have
lost my way,

505
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:47,618
but that doesn't mean that
I can't rectify things now.

506
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,420
Fine.

507
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:51,022
What if I was
to tell you

508
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,990
I never planned
on destroying Dad?

509
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:55,459
I'd say you were full of it.
Yes, I want to
assemble the sword,

510
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:57,295
yes, I want to cut through
the gates, blah, blah,

511
00:19:57,297 --> 00:19:59,664
but then I was just gonna
kick Mum into Heaven

512
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,365
and slam the gates
behind her.

513
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:04,035
Let the two lovebirds torture
each other for eternity.

514
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,937
And that's better?
Yes.

515
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:07,471
No!

516
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:09,006
Regardless of whether
you're with Mom or not,

517
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:11,209
I simply can't
let Mom loose on Dad.

518
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:13,144
Now, it is finally
time that I go back

519
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:16,180
to being the loyal soldier
that he entrusted me to be.

520
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:18,616
Mom is not
going anywhere!

521
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:21,285
Well, I am afraid that we do not
have a choice, Brother!

522
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:22,653
Mum's powers
are returning,

523
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,489
and it won't be long
before we can't contain them.

524
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:27,225
I mean, she's already
killed one person,

525
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,927
and now the detective is on a...

526
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:32,129
the detective is on her case.

527
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:33,464
So, please,
no discussion.

528
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:36,334
Mum has to go!
(elevator bell dings)

529
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:39,003
MAZE:
She already has.

530
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:42,440
Your mother's gone.

531
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,710
What?

532
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:48,112
MOM: It's Cheval
something or other.

533
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:50,948
It's valuable,
so it must be good.

534
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:57,288
I wasn't expecting to see you

535
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,623
or your...
(chuckles)

536
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,925
deadly light back so soon.

537
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:02,793
Well, something's
been bothering me.

538
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:05,596
When you first
saw my wound...

539
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,798
you asked if Lucifer
had done it.

540
00:21:08,668 --> 00:21:10,268
What did you
mean by that?

541
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,969
I meant nothing by it.

542
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:12,803
(chuckles):
You know?

543
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:15,172
Meaningless brain fart,
you know?

544
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:17,808
Just blah. Came out.

545
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:20,011
There was a lot
going on that day.

546
00:21:20,013 --> 00:21:21,545
Hmm.

547
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:24,548
I don't think so.

548
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:27,018
I think, in fact,

549
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,786
that you know something.

550
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,554
I don't want to
hurt you, Linda.

551
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:33,758
I... am running...

552
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,559
out of time.

553
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:38,396
You've seen what's
happening to me.

554
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:42,166
So you can either
tell me what you know

555
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:44,302
over a glass of wine

556
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:48,906
or over your own
charbroiled corpse.

557
00:21:48,908 --> 00:21:50,574
Your choice.

558
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,847
I came here to grill
Kathleen on the false alibi.

559
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:59,684
DAN: Whoa. Somebody
already had, huh?

560
00:21:59,686 --> 00:22:01,552
Yeah.

561
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:02,753
It's Ava Lyon.

562
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:04,755
I'm thinking whoever killed Chet

563
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:07,191
hired the Lyon sisters
to clean up,

564
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:08,659
then cleaned up the cleaner.

565
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:10,795
Excuse me, what is going on?

566
00:22:10,797 --> 00:22:11,796
I work here.

567
00:22:12,632 --> 00:22:14,765
Ava!

568
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:16,067
Stop.

569
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:18,836
(crying):
Oh, my God.

570
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,771
What did I do?

571
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:24,041
KATHLEEN:
<i> It's me, only me.</i>

572
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:26,410
Ava knew nothing about it.

573
00:22:28,081 --> 00:22:29,880
I wasn't lying about Brad.

574
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:31,615
I did get back
together with him,

575
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:35,252
but he gambles a lot,
and he needed money.

576
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:40,691
Then I got this call
offering me a hundred grand.

577
00:22:42,829 --> 00:22:45,363
Who hired you?

578
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:47,531
Who killed Chet and your sister?

579
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:51,102
Maybe Ava's death was a warning.

580
00:22:51,104 --> 00:22:53,371
For me to keep
my mouth shut.

581
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:55,840
Maybe if I don't say anything...

582
00:22:55,842 --> 00:22:57,908
(sighs)

583
00:23:00,947 --> 00:23:03,280
So how do we find Mom?

584
00:23:03,282 --> 00:23:05,783
Follow the trail
of roasted humans?

585
00:23:05,785 --> 00:23:08,252
Well, if anyone can find
that wily goddess, it's Maze.

586
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:10,454
She's on it.
(phone ringing)

587
00:23:12,658 --> 00:23:14,158
Detective.
Everything all right?

588
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,426
CHLOE:
We found a body.

589
00:23:15,428 --> 00:23:16,427
Another body?

590
00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:17,428
A burned head.

591
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,063
Same burned head?
CHLOE: Yes.

592
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:21,799
So, what, you think whoever
killed Chet killed again?

593
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:23,701
Look, Lucifer,
it's a long story,

594
00:23:23,703 --> 00:23:25,703
but the second victim
is Ava Lyon.

595
00:23:25,705 --> 00:23:27,538
She's one of
the cleaners we met.

596
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,039
I have her sister Kathleen here,

597
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:31,208
but she's not saying anything--
she's scared.

598
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,777
So I need you to come here,

599
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:34,812
and I need you to do
your mojo thing.

600
00:23:34,814 --> 00:23:37,882
Yes, Detective,
believe me when I say

601
00:23:37,884 --> 00:23:40,451
I want to find the killer
as much as you do.

602
00:23:40,453 --> 00:23:41,886
Hello, boys.

603
00:23:41,888 --> 00:23:42,820
Mum.

604
00:23:42,822 --> 00:23:44,422
What? What? What's going on?

605
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:46,690
I-I'm so sorry. My mum's here.

606
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:48,426
I-I've got to rush.

607
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:50,795
Good luck with
Kathleen. Ciao.

608
00:23:50,797 --> 00:23:52,163
Damn it.

609
00:23:52,165 --> 00:23:53,764
What's wrong?
Lucifer.

610
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:54,899
He's...

611
00:23:54,901 --> 00:23:57,368
He's hiding something from me,
I can tell.

612
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:59,703
Oh, you know what? It's probably
just embarrassing family stuff.

613
00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:01,772
I mean, they seem
totally bonkers.

614
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:02,940
Yeah.

615
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,308
Maybe.

616
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:08,179
He is with
his step-mom now, so...

617
00:24:08,181 --> 00:24:10,581
So maybe...

618
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:13,284
maybe he's not hiding
<i> something</i> from me,

619
00:24:13,286 --> 00:24:14,552
but<i> someone.</i>

620
00:24:14,554 --> 00:24:17,688
Someone who knew Chet.

621
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:20,624
And someone I still don't trust.

622
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:21,992
AMENADIEL:
What have you been doing?

623
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:24,228
Oh... this and that.

624
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,964
<i> This</i> being firing up
the celestial barbecue

625
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:29,567
so<i> that</i> you can
grill another head?

626
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:31,969
No. I just needed
to get cleaned up.

627
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,604
Get some air.

628
00:24:33,606 --> 00:24:35,606
I was feeling
a little claustrophobic.

629
00:24:35,608 --> 00:24:39,543
Don't you just hate
being kept in the dark?

630
00:24:41,881 --> 00:24:44,615
The good news is
you found Amenadiel.

631
00:24:44,617 --> 00:24:47,852
So we have the piece?

632
00:24:47,854 --> 00:24:48,752
Yes.

633
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:50,721
Yes. Well, interesting
story, actually.

634
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:52,056
Why don't you
tell her, Brother?

635
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:54,225
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
This one's all you.

636
00:24:54,227 --> 00:24:56,093
Brother, I insist.

637
00:24:57,497 --> 00:24:59,263
Thank you.
(chuckles softly)

638
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:00,664
Right. Well, uh,

639
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,032
upon careful
consideration,

640
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:04,168
we've decided this whole
Flaming Sword plan

641
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,369
is a crap idea.

642
00:25:05,371 --> 00:25:06,504
Yes, crap.

643
00:25:06,506 --> 00:25:07,638
Mm. Have you ever considered

644
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,740
finding, well,
I don't know,

645
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:11,008
a-a place of your own?

646
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,711
Yeah. Somewhere away
from Dad, maybe?

647
00:25:13,713 --> 00:25:14,512
Yes.

648
00:25:14,514 --> 00:25:16,247
LUCIFER:
Somewhere familiar,

649
00:25:16,249 --> 00:25:18,249
warmer, perhaps?

650
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:23,521
You want...
you want me back in Hell?

651
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:25,256
Well, not<i> in</i> Hell,
per se,

652
00:25:25,258 --> 00:25:26,524
but in charge of Hell.

653
00:25:26,526 --> 00:25:28,392
I mean, after all,
it is a kingdom

654
00:25:28,394 --> 00:25:29,693
without a ruler.

655
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:30,961
He is right.

656
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:33,397
I mean, there's a great
opportunity for upward mobility.

657
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:35,099
Lick of paint
here or there.

658
00:25:35,101 --> 00:25:37,668
The columns
would look great in white.

659
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:41,572
Beige?

660
00:25:43,543 --> 00:25:45,509
(chuckles softly)

661
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:47,311
So it's true.

662
00:25:47,313 --> 00:25:49,947
You<i> are</i> working
against me.

663
00:25:49,949 --> 00:25:55,252
You never planned
on going with me to Heaven.

664
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:56,387
Wait.

665
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:58,389
How did you find out?

666
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:01,759
Well, I persuaded...

667
00:26:01,761 --> 00:26:03,694
your little doctor.

668
00:26:03,696 --> 00:26:06,030
I'm sorry.
I had no choice.

669
00:26:06,032 --> 00:26:07,298
What did you do?

670
00:26:08,534 --> 00:26:10,167
Mum.

671
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:11,335
AMENADIEL:
Mom.

672
00:26:11,337 --> 00:26:12,736
Listen, I understand.

673
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,138
You're angry.

674
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:17,641
Oh, I'm not angry.

675
00:26:18,544 --> 00:26:21,312
Just disappointed.

676
00:26:21,314 --> 00:26:22,646
(Lucifer and Amenadiel grunt)

677
00:26:28,154 --> 00:26:29,620
(groaning)

678
00:26:31,591 --> 00:26:33,924
Give me the piece!

679
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,259
No, Mom.

680
00:26:36,996 --> 00:26:39,063
You're gonna have to kill me.

681
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:47,304
Guess I'll have to find
another way, won't I?

682
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,613
Well, now look
what you've made her do.

683
00:26:55,615 --> 00:26:56,747
I've just had this tuned!

684
00:26:56,749 --> 00:27:00,718
Me? How about you
suggesting Hell

685
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,220
as a retirement home? Nice.

686
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:04,321
Maybe if you had just

687
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:05,456
mentioned the pottery class

688
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:08,525
or water aerobics,
she would have gone for it.

689
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:09,994
Oh, and did you have
a better idea?

690
00:27:09,996 --> 00:27:13,097
Mom's coming undone, Luci.

691
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:16,266
In every way.
I know.

692
00:27:16,268 --> 00:27:18,636
And she doesn't care
who she hurts anymore.

693
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:20,037
Linda.

694
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:21,338
I'll go check on Linda.

695
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,273
You go after Mom;
she'll listen to you.

696
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:25,309
But, Luci, don't you dare
promise her that piece,

697
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:27,177
because I won't
give it to her.

698
00:27:32,418 --> 00:27:35,719
♪ ♪

699
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:43,894
Well, well.
Someone's clever.

700
00:27:43,896 --> 00:27:46,330
How did you get me?

701
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:48,465
Wasn't that hard.
We tracked your phone.

702
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:52,369
No, I mean, how did you
figure out I was the bad guy?

703
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:55,072
Did Little Miss Dandy Lyon
tell you?

704
00:27:55,074 --> 00:27:56,940
It's over, Charlotte.
Put your hands up.

705
00:27:56,942 --> 00:27:58,709
Oh, don't worry, I'm
not going to resist.

706
00:27:58,711 --> 00:28:00,844
I'll tell you everything
you want to know.

707
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:03,347
I just have one small request.

708
00:28:06,152 --> 00:28:08,285
(phone ringing)

709
00:28:08,287 --> 00:28:09,820
Detective.

710
00:28:09,822 --> 00:28:11,221
Any chance you've seen my Mu...

711
00:28:11,223 --> 00:28:12,823
MOM:
Looking for little ol' me?

712
00:28:12,825 --> 00:28:13,891
You were right, dear.

713
00:28:13,893 --> 00:28:16,694
Your detective
is quite good.

714
00:28:16,696 --> 00:28:18,095
(Mom chuckles)

715
00:28:18,097 --> 00:28:19,463
(whispers):
She caught me.

716
00:28:19,465 --> 00:28:20,564
Where are you?

717
00:28:20,566 --> 00:28:21,699
Santa Monica Pier.

718
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:22,866
Such a beautiful place.

719
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,335
So many people.

720
00:28:25,337 --> 00:28:27,204
If you hurt anyone, Mum,

721
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:28,539
if you hurt her...

722
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:31,408
And if you and your brother had
just given me what I needed.

723
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:32,710
But who knows?

724
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:34,111
Maybe you still can.

725
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,413
Okay, that's enough.

726
00:28:36,415 --> 00:28:38,282
Mum!

727
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:40,317
Start talking.

728
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:42,820
Just the two of us.

729
00:28:42,822 --> 00:28:44,221
If that's all right.

730
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:47,291
I'd rather not
put Daniel in...

731
00:28:47,293 --> 00:28:49,593
an awkward position.

732
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:52,730
Hate to ruin all the good ones
we've been in.

733
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:54,331
(clears throat)

734
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:55,599
Can we go outside?

735
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:56,867
Mm-hmm.

736
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:59,069
I'll be fine.

737
00:29:08,547 --> 00:29:10,781
I'll miss you, Daniel.

738
00:29:10,783 --> 00:29:13,383
You are my
favorite human.

739
00:29:18,624 --> 00:29:20,324
(phone ringing)

740
00:29:20,326 --> 00:29:21,525
Hey. You find Mom?

741
00:29:21,527 --> 00:29:24,461
She's on Santa Monica Pier,
and she wants the piece.

742
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:26,330
(horn honks, tires screech)

743
00:29:26,332 --> 00:29:28,665
We have to give it to her,
Amenadiel.

744
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:30,234
We've run out of options.

745
00:29:30,236 --> 00:29:31,235
Please.

746
00:29:31,237 --> 00:29:33,370
Brother, please.

747
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:36,940
She... she has Chloe.

748
00:29:40,913 --> 00:29:43,013
Linda! You here?!

749
00:29:43,015 --> 00:29:44,948
I'm tracking Lucifer's mom,

750
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,985
and I think she might
be on her way.

751
00:29:50,656 --> 00:29:53,090
(groans weakly)

752
00:29:53,092 --> 00:29:54,525
Oh, no.

753
00:29:54,527 --> 00:29:57,127
No, no, no!

754
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:02,699
Linda.

755
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:04,568
Hey. It's okay.

756
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,637
I'm here. Okay?

757
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:08,105
You're gonna be fine.

758
00:30:10,776 --> 00:30:13,210
She did this to you, didn't she?

759
00:30:13,212 --> 00:30:16,947
(crying): She wanted to know
what Lucifer's plans were.

760
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:18,949
I didn't want
to tell her.

761
00:30:18,951 --> 00:30:21,051
I tried to resist.
I'm so sorry.

762
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:23,086
It's not your fault, okay?

763
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:25,422
And you're going to be fine.

764
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:26,757
I promise.

765
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:28,425
I'm-I'm gonna fix you.

766
00:30:28,427 --> 00:30:29,993
Okay?

767
00:30:35,568 --> 00:30:37,034
(crying):
Help me.

768
00:30:38,971 --> 00:30:41,338
Hello, Daniel.

769
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,339
Whoa!

770
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:43,874
Whoa, whoa!

771
00:30:43,876 --> 00:30:45,342
She kissed me.

772
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:46,577
Literally no idea
what you're talking about.

773
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:47,578
Just get your hands up.

774
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,679
No, don't be silly.

775
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:50,113
I'm not gonna stab you.

776
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:51,481
I'm just looking
for something.

777
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:53,417
Come on, up. Up!

778
00:30:56,255 --> 00:30:58,322
What are you looking for?

779
00:30:58,324 --> 00:30:59,489
Uh...

780
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:01,024
Hello.
Whoa.

781
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:02,926
What the...?

782
00:31:03,462 --> 00:31:04,862
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

783
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:06,263
Ah.

784
00:31:06,265 --> 00:31:07,531
Ah-ah-ah.
It's my brother's.

785
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:10,033
He left it there for
safekeeping, so thanks for that.

786
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:11,668
You're a lifesaver.

787
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,704
Okay, Charlotte, this
has been a great chat,

788
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:15,372
but are you gonna
confess or what?

789
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:17,307
I'll never understand
why you concern yourselves

790
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:20,811
with one little human,
but... fine.

791
00:31:20,813 --> 00:31:22,913
Yes, I was involved
in Chet's death,

792
00:31:22,915 --> 00:31:25,148
but not in the way you think.

793
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,150
Well, correct me if I'm
wrong. You killed him.

794
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:29,386
You hired a cleaner to
take care of the body.

795
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:30,687
And then you
killed the cleaner.

796
00:31:30,689 --> 00:31:32,122
Is that it?

797
00:31:32,124 --> 00:31:33,657
The cleaner's dead?

798
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:34,658
(quietly):
What?

799
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,126
Oh, that's unfortunate.

800
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:38,562
I certainly had nothing
to do with that.

801
00:31:38,564 --> 00:31:41,365
But if you didn't,
then who did?

802
00:31:41,367 --> 00:31:42,332
LUCIFER:
Mom!

803
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:44,902
I've got it.

804
00:31:44,904 --> 00:31:46,503
Now let the detective go.

805
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:47,504
Lucifer,

806
00:31:47,506 --> 00:31:48,805
put down the knife.

807
00:31:48,807 --> 00:31:50,774
You can't protect
your mother anymore.

808
00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:52,209
I'm not protecting her.

809
00:31:52,211 --> 00:31:53,911
It's you I'm trying to save.

810
00:31:53,913 --> 00:31:55,879
Now, here it is, Mum.

811
00:31:55,881 --> 00:31:58,782
I have the blade
and the final piece.

812
00:31:58,784 --> 00:32:00,183
You let the
detective go,

813
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:02,052
and they are yours.

814
00:32:02,054 --> 00:32:03,754
CHLOE:
Let me go? Really?

815
00:32:03,756 --> 00:32:05,005
I'm the one holding her.

816
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,255
Mum?
MAN:
No one's going anywhere!

817
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:08,025
(crowd gasping)

818
00:32:08,027 --> 00:32:10,527
Oh, I think we found
our mystery killer.

819
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:12,562
How can you be so glib?!

820
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:13,830
You were our lawyer!

821
00:32:13,832 --> 00:32:15,098
You betrayed us!

822
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,266
Put the gun down, Hector.

823
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:18,035
HECTOR: Thank you for
leading me to her, Detective.

824
00:32:18,037 --> 00:32:21,471
You promised to approach this
fairly, and you did.

825
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:23,807
But now I have to make things
right for my family.

826
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:24,808
LUCIFER:
Ah!

827
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,543
A little wrinkle.

828
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:27,678
You shoot her

829
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,346
and we're all dead, okay?

830
00:32:31,016 --> 00:32:32,950
I need a hospital.

831
00:32:32,952 --> 00:32:34,551
Yes.

832
00:32:34,553 --> 00:32:35,686
Okay.

833
00:32:35,688 --> 00:32:37,688
It's too far, Maze.

834
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,289
She won't make it.

835
00:32:40,092 --> 00:32:42,392
We need to do something.

836
00:32:43,696 --> 00:32:45,562
We need more time.

837
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:48,165
We just need
more time.

838
00:32:59,578 --> 00:33:01,878
What are you doing?

839
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,414
Look, it's very difficult
to explain,

840
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:06,216
but believe me
when I say

841
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:09,119
that there are many,
many lives at stake here.

842
00:33:09,121 --> 00:33:13,256
So, please,
just put the gun down, huh?

843
00:33:17,863 --> 00:33:19,196
LUCIFER:
No!

844
00:33:26,905 --> 00:33:29,072
♪ ♪

845
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:41,551
Amenadiel.

846
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:43,754
You son of a bitch.

847
00:33:47,926 --> 00:33:49,526
How?

848
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:51,361
Go.

849
00:33:58,871 --> 00:34:00,103
(groans)

850
00:34:13,886 --> 00:34:16,119
I'm sorry, Mum.

851
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:20,457
But I'm afraid
that this ends now.

852
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:29,900
You've hurt so many people,
Mum. It has to stop.

853
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:32,636
You know that everything I've
done, I've done for, for us,

854
00:34:32,638 --> 00:34:33,970
for our family.

855
00:34:33,972 --> 00:34:35,672
You used me.

856
00:34:35,674 --> 00:34:37,441
Used Chloe.

857
00:34:37,443 --> 00:34:38,942
Me?

858
00:34:38,944 --> 00:34:40,377
What about your father?

859
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:43,480
He created Chloe
just to manipulate you.

860
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:47,117
Lucifer, look.

861
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,086
We have the sword.

862
00:34:49,088 --> 00:34:52,823
Finally, finally,
we can get revenge.

863
00:34:52,825 --> 00:34:55,392
We can destroy him.

864
00:34:55,394 --> 00:34:57,227
We can take our home back.

865
00:34:57,229 --> 00:34:59,396
I'm not leaving, Mum!

866
00:34:59,398 --> 00:35:00,964
Okay.

867
00:35:00,966 --> 00:35:03,233
I can take care of it
for both of us.

868
00:35:03,235 --> 00:35:08,371
Just give me the sword,
and I'll do the rest.

869
00:35:10,242 --> 00:35:12,442
Please, son. I just...

870
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:16,113
I just want a chance
to start over.

871
00:35:16,115 --> 00:35:19,649
But... going home?

872
00:35:21,954 --> 00:35:24,221
That's not starting over,
that's...

873
00:35:24,223 --> 00:35:26,356
that's going backwards.

874
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,760
And that's not good for anyone.

875
00:35:33,532 --> 00:35:37,601
So it's time for you
to move forward, Mum.

876
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:42,873
Even if it means
I'll never see you again.

877
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:45,909
Lucifer.

878
00:35:45,911 --> 00:35:47,511
No!

879
00:35:47,513 --> 00:35:49,412
(yells)

880
00:35:50,716 --> 00:35:54,417
Bloody hell, it worked.

881
00:35:54,419 --> 00:35:57,654
I guess it can cut through
anything, even the world itself.

882
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:59,356
What is that?

883
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:01,057
It's-it's nothing.

884
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:04,828
At least, for now.

885
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:07,998
This is the real way
to move forward, Mum.

886
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,035
To create a whole new world,
your own world, without Father.

887
00:36:12,037 --> 00:36:14,204
But what about you?

888
00:36:14,206 --> 00:36:16,673
Amenadiel? My children?

889
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:19,242
You know that if
we go back to Heaven,

890
00:36:19,244 --> 00:36:21,144
then there will be a war.

891
00:36:21,146 --> 00:36:22,979
And in war,

892
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:26,183
there are always casualties.

893
00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:32,155
The last thing I want
is to hurt my children.

894
00:36:32,157 --> 00:36:34,090

So what do you think
will happen to Charlotte?

947
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:22,726
Well, given her law firm's
track record, probably not much.

948
00:39:22,728 --> 00:39:25,261
You know, the more I think
about it, the more I think

949
00:39:25,263 --> 00:39:27,364
that Hector killed
both victims.

950
00:39:27,366 --> 00:39:29,132
What, you think
he killed his own brother?

951
00:39:29,134 --> 00:39:30,767
I think you would be
the first to agree.

952
00:39:30,769 --> 00:39:32,969
You know, things between
families can get pretty heated.

953
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:33,970
(chuckles)

954
00:39:33,972 --> 00:39:35,739
Yes. Heated.

955
00:39:35,741 --> 00:39:38,274
Oh, and Ella found a Mondo
blowtorch in Hector's car,

956
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:40,076
so there's that.
Right.

957
00:39:40,078 --> 00:39:42,912
The only thing
I still don't understand is

958
00:39:42,914 --> 00:39:45,415
you seemed to have
some inkling of this

959
00:39:45,417 --> 00:39:47,384

beginning, so...

960
00:39:47,386 --> 00:39:48,852
