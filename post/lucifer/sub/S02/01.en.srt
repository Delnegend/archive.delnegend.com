1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:03,771
<i> Previously on</i> Lucifer...
LINDA:<i> So, you're the Devil</i>

2
00:00:03,771 --> 00:00:05,771
and you've left Hell behind

3
00:00:05,773 --> 00:00:08,243
to take a vacation
in Los Angeles.

4
00:00:08,242 --> 00:00:09,442
Well, where else would I go?

5
00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:10,683
Your return to the Underworld

6
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:12,278
has been requested.

7
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:15,179
Remind Dad that I quit Hell
because I was sick and tired

8
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:16,252
of playing a part in his play.

9
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,280
CHLOE:
<i> I got it.</i>

10
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:18,954
The name,
the whole Lucifer thing,

11
00:00:18,953 --> 00:00:20,653
and desire's
like your superpower.

12
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:21,654
More like a gift from God,
really.

13
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:23,355
Why don't I affect you,
Detective?

14
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,157
I guess we both have
our mysteries.

15
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:26,359
MAZE:
<i> Chloe Decker is causing</i>
<i> your vulnerability.</i>

16
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,790
I'm bleeding.

17
00:00:27,795 --> 00:00:29,655
AMENADIEL:
<i> I've been sleeping</i>
<i> with a demon.</i>

18
00:00:29,663 --> 00:00:31,333
I'm ready to turn myself in.

19
00:00:31,332 --> 00:00:33,002
DAN:
<i> I removed a firearm</i>
<i> from evidence lockup.</i>

20
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:36,102
LUCIFER:<i> Dad.</i>

21
00:00:36,103 --> 00:00:37,743
<i> I'll be the son</i>

22
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:40,638
<i> that you always</i>
<i> wanted me to be.</i>

23
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:42,371
<i> This is impossible.</i>

24
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:43,376
(gasps)

25
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:44,377
Where's Maze?

26
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,308
I was gonna ask you
the same question.

27
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:47,383
What does Father want?

28
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:48,581
Someone's escaped from Hell.

29
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:50,322
Who escaped Hell?

30
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:51,977
Mum.

31
00:00:52,987 --> 00:00:54,487
â™ª Money â™ª

32
00:00:56,857 --> 00:01:00,457
â™ª And fancy clothes â™ª

33
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:05,964
â™ª Money â™ª

34
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:09,601
â™ª And fancy clothes... â™ª

35
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:12,403
(people screaming)
MAN:
Everybody, get the
hell on the ground!

36
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,606
(alarm ringing)

37
00:01:19,547 --> 00:01:20,807
Fill the bag with everything

38
00:01:20,815 --> 00:01:22,145
on display.

39
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:23,279
Hurry up!

40
00:01:23,284 --> 00:01:24,654
(grunting)

41
00:01:24,652 --> 00:01:26,892
This is such a clichÃ©.

42
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:28,817
I mean, for one,

43
00:01:28,823 --> 00:01:30,223
those are all
conflict diamonds.

44
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:31,294
Terrible karma,

45
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:32,832
but more importantly,

46
00:01:32,827 --> 00:01:35,427
is this really how you want
to spend your time on Earth?

47
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:36,899
I don't know who you are,

48
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:39,157
but if you don't step back,
I will kill you.

49
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:40,166
(chuckles)

50
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:41,297
But that's not what

51
00:01:41,302 --> 00:01:42,802
you really desire, is it?

52
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:46,736
No, it isn't.

53
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,010
So, what do you want?

54
00:01:50,044 --> 00:01:51,444
Freedom.

55
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:52,675
LUCIFER:
Oh...

56
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,550
just as I suspected.

57
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:56,318
You were tired of being
a prisoner, weren't you?

58
00:01:56,317 --> 00:01:58,147
Yeah, that's right.

59
00:01:58,152 --> 00:01:59,252
I-I-I couldn't take it anymore.

60
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:02,053
So you wanted to break
your shackles, be reborn.

61
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:03,056
I did.

62
00:02:03,057 --> 00:02:03,857
So you escaped Hell,

63
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:04,858
looking for an empty body,

64
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:06,329
and found
this poor sod,

65
00:02:06,327 --> 00:02:07,657
who'd just died
of a heart attack,

66
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:10,461
and now here you are,
wreaking havoc on Earth.

67
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,334
The jig is up.

68
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,673
We found you, Mum.

69
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:16,738
Wait, what?

70
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:18,967
You just said you wanted
to escape your shackles.

71
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:20,073
Yeah.

72
00:02:20,074 --> 00:02:22,214
When the paramedics
brought me back,

73
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:23,979
I realized I needed to be free.

74
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:25,478
Yes, from Hell.

75
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,079
No, man, from debt.

76
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:28,681
I owe a ton of money.

77
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:30,552
And this was gonna get me
out from underneath it.

78
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:32,221
You know what, I'm sick of this.

79
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:33,989
The two of you are...

80
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:35,088
(sighs)

81
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:36,089
It's not Mom.

82
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,390
Oh, you think?

83
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:38,491
AMENADIEL:
Well, we had to check.

84
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,162
She doesn't have a body.

85
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:41,631
She must have entered
a human form

86
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:43,029
of someone who's recently died.

87
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,660
Which means anyone
who kicked the bucket

88
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:45,925
whilst you were sleeping
on the job.

89
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:48,603
Luci, do you realize
he's the last one on our list?

90
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:51,496
Well, you must have missed one.

91
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,905
Or maybe she's not
in Los Angeles.

92
00:02:53,908 --> 00:02:55,308
(laughing):
No, she's here.

93
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:57,239
I kept her prisoner
for thousands of years.

94
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:58,244
She's coming for me.

95
00:02:58,245 --> 00:02:59,545
I know it.

96
00:02:59,547 --> 00:03:01,377
We just need to get
to her first.

97
00:03:01,382 --> 00:03:02,982
(sighs)

98
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:04,123
Are you coming?!

99
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:06,018
In a moment.

100
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,220
There's so much punishment,
so little time.

101
00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:11,163
(chuckles)

102
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:14,088
...dead.

103
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:17,004
â™ª Money... â™ª

104
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:17,827
(gasps)

105
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:19,261
â™ª And fancy clothes. â™ª

106
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:20,266
(shouts)

107
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:21,567
What's going on?

108
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:24,743
(groans)

109
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:26,208
LUCIFER:
<i> My mum's gonna kill me.</i>

110
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:28,537
And before you say it,
that's not a metaphor.

111
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,282
She's literally
going to kill me.

112
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:32,207
She's not the forgiving type.

113
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:34,283
You've never mentioned
your mother before.

114
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:36,231
Why is that?

115
00:03:36,232 --> 00:03:38,182
Well, you wouldn't understand,
would you?

116
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:40,015
I'd like to.

117
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,488
Oh, all right.

118
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,560
Very well.

119
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,858
In human terms,

120
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,330
once upon a time,
a boy met a girl,

121
00:03:50,331 --> 00:03:52,331
and they fell in love.

122
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,673
They had sex.

123
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:55,367
The only trouble was,

124
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:56,939
they were celestial beings,

125
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:58,496
so that moment created
the universe.

126
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:00,005
Mm, the Big Bang?

127
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:02,567
Never knew how appropriate
the name was until now, did you?

128
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,306
Anyway, they became
Mum and Dad.

129
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:08,181
They had a whole litter of kids,
including yours truly.

130
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:09,582
And they built a house.

131
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:10,683
They called it Heaven.

132
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:11,724
They were happy.

133
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,589
Dad was...

134
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,187
well, Dad, and Mum...

135
00:04:17,992 --> 00:04:22,032
Well, Mum was rather lovely
in the beginning.

136
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,899
(sighs)

137
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:25,297
But things change, don't they?

138
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,230
Dad started going
into the garage

139
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:31,295
and tinkering with a little
project he called humanity.

140
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:36,543
Mum grew cold... distant.

141
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:37,883
(inhales deeply)

142
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:40,178
And pretty soon, they were both
neglecting their family.

143
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,250
And then one of his children
started to act out?

144
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,350
Indeed.

145
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:45,881
Yeah... so Dad got pissed off

146
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:47,546
and tossed me out of the house.

147
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:50,024
And what did your mother do?

148
00:04:50,024 --> 00:04:51,964
Nothing.

149
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:55,089
She just stood there
and let it happen.

150
00:04:56,864 --> 00:04:58,864
Anyway, a couple
of thousand years later,

151
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:00,666
Dad kicked her out, too.

152
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:03,738
Cast her into Hell
and put her in a cell.

153
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:07,467
So, I did the same for her
as she did for me.

154
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,174
Zilch.

155
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,414
<i> Is it good to be back</i>

156
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:13,783
on a studio set,
Detective?

157
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:14,811
CHLOE:
Not really.

158
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,145
(Lucifer chuckles)

159
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,020
It's bringing back memories
of your acting days?

160
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:20,189
If you're feeling nostalgic,

161
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:23,887
sure I can find some horny
teenagers and a hot tub.

162
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:25,221
'Cause the movie
you were in was...

163
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:26,015
Yeah, I got it.

164
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:27,426
Is everything all right,
Detective?

165
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:28,928
You seem distracted.

166
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:30,529
Usually I get at least
a glimmer of a smile

167
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:31,531
from my remarks,

168
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:32,762
the occasional eye roll.

169
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:35,026
I think I got
a snort once.

170
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,835
Two days ago, you were
shot point-blank.

171
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,697
Ah, well, no need to
thank me for my heroism.

172
00:05:38,706 --> 00:05:39,706
Well, maybe just a little.

173
00:05:39,707 --> 00:05:40,707
No one's stopping you.

174
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:41,738
(chuckles)

175
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:43,482
There was blood
all over you.

176
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:44,737
You should be dead.
Well,

177
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:46,014
par for the course
for our adventures,

178
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,053
Detective.
What's new?

179
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:48,607
I have a sample of your blood

180
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:49,975
and I'm gonna take it
and test it.

181
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:51,383
Oh.
And I'm gonna
find out

182
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:53,315
exactly what you are
once and for all.

183
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,320
Yeah.
Oh.

184
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:55,251
The Devil himself?

185
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:56,285
No, I'm guessing
Larry Morningstar,

186
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,790
the son of a plumber
in Connecticut.

187
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,961
Right, well, wrap
that up, would you?

188
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,630
'Cause I could use
your help on my end.

189
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:03,778
I'm on a bit of a manhunt.

190
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,930
Well, womanhunt, and I need
to find her before...

191
00:06:09,303 --> 00:06:11,343
I'm too late.

192
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:13,338
â™ª â™ª

193
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:22,478
(sighs)

194
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:24,323
So, our victim's name
is Gillian Taylor.

195
00:06:24,318 --> 00:06:27,718
She was a stand-in for the lead
actress on<i> Leave It to Leslie.</i>

196
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:28,821
Stand-in?

197
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:30,962
Yeah, stand-ins are
used to light a scene

198
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,118
as the actors prep.

199
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,285
Usually want to be
actors themselves.

200
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:36,163
And now she's dead
because of me.

201
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:37,303
What do you mean,
because of you?

202
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:38,297
Well, remind you
of anyone?

203
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:40,598
That's weird.

204
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:41,801
CHLOE:
What's weird, Ella?

205
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:43,572
Well...

206
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,870
you'd think
cause of death would be

207
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:47,113
the giant
chunks of metal

208
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:49,167
sticking out of her head,
but no,

209
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:50,176
she was strangled.
Look.

210
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:51,577
You can see the contusions
on her neck.

211
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,178
So, the horns were added
postmortem?

212
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,620
Yeah, soft tissue at the point
of impact is yellow-pink.

213
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:58,447
That means that there
was no blood pressure

214
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:00,592
when our killer
went all stabby-stab.

215
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:01,387
And...

216
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:03,888
she was killed somewhere else.

217
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:05,321
This body
was moved here.

218
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:07,385
So, the killer is sending
a message.

219
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:08,634
Ah, good, so you agree with me.

220
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:10,599
I didn't say the
message was to you.

221
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:11,827
Well, who else
would it be for?

222
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:13,872
(sighs)

223
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:14,897
What the hell?

224
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,200
Oh, joy of joys,
I thought Detective Douche

225
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:20,236
was in jail.

226
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,440
He's suspended.

227
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:22,942
Or at least he was.

228
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,613
Give us a minute.

229
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:25,641
Hi.

230
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:26,506
Hey.

231
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:28,113
What are you doing here?

232
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,845
I've been reinstated.

233
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:30,920
What?

234
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:31,978
After Malcolm and everything

235
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:33,015
that happened at Palmetto,

236
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,490
they wanted to sweep everything
under the rug.

237
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:36,088
And the only thing
I confessed to was

238
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:37,459
improperly checking out
evidence.

239
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:38,918
A gun that killed someone.

240
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:40,226
I didn't ask for this.

241
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:41,987
You didn't turn it down, either.

242
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:43,155
Would you rather I go to jail?

243
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:44,303
You think Trixie
would prefer that?

244
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:48,698
No, it's just...
it's a lot to take in.

245
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:52,066
(scoffs)

246
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:53,742
I've been demoted.

247
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,240
I've been reassigned

248
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:58,182
to assist on cases, so...

249
00:07:58,178 --> 00:07:59,678
for now, how can I help?

250
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,780
Uh, interview crew members.

251
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:05,153
See if they know anything,
any enemies she had.

252
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,382
I mean, you know.

253
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:07,716
Thanks, Chloe.

254
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:08,991
Yeah.

255
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:15,334
You're a newbie,
aren't you?

256
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,129
Oh, hey, yeah.

257
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,660
Ella Lopez.

258
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,195
I just transferred
in a couple days ago.

259
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,030
You must be Detective Decker's
civilian consultant.

260
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,866
Lucifer Morningstar.

261
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:25,742
Cool.

262
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:27,613
I was expecting

263
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:29,268
a different reaction considering

264
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:30,276
your choice of bling.

265
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:31,277
Oh.

266
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:33,078
Dude, I had a friend
named Adolf.

267
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,080
Okay, Adolf.

268
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:35,361
I didn't hold it against him.

269
00:08:35,365 --> 00:08:36,645
(chuckles)
And besides,
I think the Devil

270
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,420
gets a bad rap.
Oh.

271
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:39,848
You do, do you?
Sure.

272
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,523
I mean, what did he really
do that was so bad?

273
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:44,093
What, rebel against his dad?

274
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:46,531
Ask some naked lady
if she wanted an apple?

275
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:48,287
Be still my heart.
Do go on.

276
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:49,995
I suppose he does run Hell.

277
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:52,427
That's not so great,
you know, with the torture

278
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:53,772
and eternal damnation.

279
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:54,667
I'm retired.

280
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:55,928
And besides,
I didn't create Hell.

281
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:56,936
I just worked there.

282
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:59,237
And now you're talking

283
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:00,569
in the first person.

284
00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:01,614
Wait.

285
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:03,538
Are you...
The Devil?

286
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:05,184
...a method actor?
What?

287
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:07,148
(groans)

288
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:08,847
(clamoring)

289
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:12,179
Not exactly an
Emmy-worthy performance

290
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:13,315
from our child actor.

291
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,950
LUCIFER:
And her dick nozzle boyfriend.

292
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:15,745
CHLOE:
Weird, for a girl

293
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:16,856
who normally doesn't
wear mascara,

294
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:18,387
she's certainly
wearing a lot.

295
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:19,932
I wonder why.

296
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:20,927
Trixie loves her show.

297
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:22,688
Oh, my God, me, too.

298
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:28,369
LUCIFER: Sweet candy
coating on the outside,

299
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:30,238
delicious evil
on the inside?

300
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:31,767
Or she just likes
the attention.

301
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:34,012
Either way, she's got a wall
of reps surrounding her.

302
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:35,467
I've got a call in
to interview her.

303
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:37,735
But for now let's
focus on Gillian.

304
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,714
Yeah.

305
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:45,452
Gillian rented from me
for four years.

306
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:47,822
Such a sweet, strong girl.

307
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:50,961
You know, I... I don't have
a daughter, but, uh...

308
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:55,333
You know, she got so close
on so many auditions.

309
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:59,829
I... I really thought that
she was gonna break in.

310
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,940
This is my fault.

311
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,208
Why do you say that?

312
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:09,007
WOMAN:
Well, I work as a set nurse.

313
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:10,239
I pulled a few strings.

314
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:12,083
I got her that job.

315
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,079
If she hadn't met Amy...

316
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:15,451
Do you think
Amy did this?

317
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:18,279
No, sweet, darling,
innocent Amy?

318
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:21,245
Oh, I'm sensing sarcasm
and general loathing.

319
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:23,254
Oh, that girl's
a bad influence.

320
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:25,816
She has so much cocaine
up her nose, it would snow

321
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:27,656
if you shook her.
(chuckles)
Yes, I've tried that.

322
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:29,331
WOMAN:
The show kept it
out of the news.

323
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:30,659
They even hid her O.D.

324
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:31,934
a couple of days ago.

325
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:34,172
Hospital was barely able
to start her heart again.

326
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:35,797
Well, hold on.

327
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,431
You're saying Amy died,
then came back to life,

328
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:38,797
and then an innocent
girl was found dead

329
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,265
with devil horns
shoved into her skull?

330
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:42,643
I... guess that's

331
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:43,813
one way to put it.

332
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,110
Yes.

333
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:50,881
Maybe Gillian wasn't
as innocent as she seemed.

334
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:56,086
Well, maybe she needed the cash
to fund her flamingo army.

335
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:58,289
We need to check
on Gillian's financials.

336
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:01,461
See if she made any large
cash deposits and, if so, when.

337
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:03,431
I don't know.
Maybe we can find a pattern.

338
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:06,160
Well, it doesn't matter, because
I know who the killer is.

339
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,596
Really? Who?

340
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:11,336
My mum.

341
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:12,868
Your mom?

342
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:14,573
It's a long story, but I think

343
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:17,244
my mum's soul is
currently inside Amy.

344
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:19,044
She's the perfect choice
of host body, really.

345
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:21,246
Young, beautiful, worshipped
and adored by millions.

346
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:23,148
You're making less sense
than you normally do.

347
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,880
That's because you
still don't believe me!

348
00:11:25,886 --> 00:11:27,446
Just test my
blood, Detective.

349
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:29,194
Then we can have
a real conversation.

350
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,726
â™ª We wear red
so they don't see us bleed â™ª

351
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:37,729
â™ª<i> Hey!</i> â™ª
â™ª Hundred dollar bills â™ª

352
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:39,901
â™ª Under our sleeve â™ª
â™ª<i> Hey!</i> â™ª

353
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,670
â™ª We intend not to sleep
till we're dead... â™ª

354
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:44,099
LUCIFER:
Oh.

355
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:45,844
Look at you, all broody.

356
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:49,908
Suits you.

357
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:53,712
Well, don't worry.

358
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:55,354
Maze always turns
up eventually.

359
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:58,218
She's like a bad penny...
in tight leather pants.

360
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,618
(chuckles)

361
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:00,919
(sighs)

362
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:03,691
Unless, of course, you
scared her away for good.

363
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,420
(laughs)
<i> I</i> scared her away?

364
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:08,725
Well, everything was fine until
you went all lovey-dovey on her.

365
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:10,099
Really?
Because I seem to remember

366
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:12,357
her telling<i> both</i> of us
where to shove it.

367
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:13,395
(scoffs)

368
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,730
â™ª Watching 'em gamble
everything they own â™ª

369
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:18,436
â™ª Singing oh,
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh... â™ª

370
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:21,508
Luci, you don't think
she helped Mom escape, do you?

371
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:23,608
Well, that doesn't sound
like the kind of evil,

372
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,010
duplicitous thing a demon
would do, now, does it?

373
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:27,712
But, no,

374
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:31,254
I don't because I found Mum.

375
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,491
You did? Where?
On a case.

376
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:35,787
And on top of that,
I think the detective's

377
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:38,819
gonna finally believe me
about who I am soon, so cheers!

378
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:40,485
Everything's coming up Lucifer.

379
00:12:40,494 --> 00:12:43,394
What did you do?
I didn't do anything.

380
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:45,626
She's going to test my blood.

381
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:48,632
She's<i> what?! </i>
Mm. Exciting, isn't it?

382
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:50,235
Humans can't have proof
of divinity!

383
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:52,637
Just the detective.
I don't see the harm.
Sure.

384
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,209
I mean, what could possibly
go wrong

385
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:57,577
if angel blood enters the police
department's forensic database?

386
00:12:57,577 --> 00:13:00,107
I'm sorry.
Am I supposed to answer that?

387
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,853
You just deal with Mom.

388
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:03,548
I'll deal with this mess.

389
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:07,150
At least I got you
to stop brooding.

390
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,988
And you're welcome.

391
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:14,731
â™ª Here comes trouble, trouble. â™ª

392
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:17,702
Hey, Chloe.
Hey.

393
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:19,127
I interviewed the crew.

394
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:22,032
For the most part, Amy and
Gillian got along great.

395
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:23,065
For the most part?

396
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:24,499
Yeah, they got
into a big fight

397
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:28,114
a couple days ago as they
were setting up a shot.

398
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:29,838
Unfortunately,
they weren't rolling audio.

399
00:13:29,843 --> 00:13:31,343
Well, I get the gist of it.

400
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:34,454
Gillian had a bunch of money
hidden away at her place.

401
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:36,247
And then this blowup.

402
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:37,449
What do you think?

403
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,420
Amy had a secret drug problem?

404
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:42,019
Then Gillian found out about it
and was blackmailing her?

405
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:43,492
If so,
that's a pretty strong motive.

406
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,660
It is, yeah.
Thanks, Dan.

407
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:56,399
â™ª Out of, baby, oh,
I'm out of control... â™ª

408
00:13:56,403 --> 00:13:57,973
(sniffs)

409
00:13:57,971 --> 00:13:59,441
(sighs)

410
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:02,869
LUCIFER:
Well, now I know where I got
my taste for the good life.

411
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:04,936
What are you
doing in here?
Amy Dodd, eh?

412
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:06,605
Role model for teen girls,

413
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:08,453
awkward erection
for their fathers.

414
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:10,878
A wolf in a sheep's
tiny skirt.

415
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:12,154
It's very appropriate,

416
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:15,122
Mum.
Who are you,
and what are you doing in here?

417
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:16,651
Yeah.

418
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:18,316
Let's stop playing games,
shall we?

419
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:22,055
I know you're not
who you pretend to be.

420
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:24,032
â™ª I know what you did to me... â™ª

421
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,200
I know who you really are.

422
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,529
All right.

423
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:30,104
Attacking me would be a waste
of... What are you doing?

424
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:31,443
You can't do this!

425
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:34,208
I'm tired of everyone
thinking I'm so innocent.

426
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,037
But I'm not, and
I'll prove it.

427
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,382
Please don't!
Oh, God, don't!

428
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,548
Good Lord, that's... Ugh.

429
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,407
Mmm. Wait.

430
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,775
You're not who I thought
you were, are you? I hope.

431
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:47,054
Oh, I'm exactly
who you think I am.

432
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,623
Well, then this truly is
the most evil thing

433
00:14:48,622 --> 00:14:49,752
that's ever happened to me.

434
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:52,056
Just-just stop doing
the buttons and just...

435
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,018
just please...
(knocking)

436
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:54,256
CHLOE:
Ms. Dodd?

437
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:57,195
Ah.
What the hell
is going on?

438
00:14:57,197 --> 00:14:59,127
Right. For once,
this is not what it looks like.

439
00:15:03,837 --> 00:15:05,737
I'm in so much trouble.
We don't care

440
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:07,239
about your drug use, Amy.
You don't?

441
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,810
What we care about is
that you Gillian

442
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:10,238
had an argument
right before she died. Why?

443
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,543
Does it matter?
We found

444
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:13,314
a lot of cash
at Gillian's house,

445
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:14,853
so if she was
blackmailing you...

446
00:15:14,848 --> 00:15:16,078
She wasn't
blackmailing me.

447
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,382
She was my sober companion.

448
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:20,545
Well, clearly
not very good at it. (chuckles)

449
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:23,023
The production company thought
it was a good idea

450
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:26,493
to hire my stand-in to
<i> also</i> keep an eye on me.

451
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:28,393
They thought
it would help keep it a secret.

452
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:30,395
What was the fight about?
I was getting

453
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:32,527
tired of her treating
me like a child.

454
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:33,732
I'm an adult!

455
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:35,433
I can make my own decisions.

456
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:36,995
Clearly.

457
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,370
I'd gotten a
new supply in.

458
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:45,936
She was trying
to take it away from me.

459
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:49,406
Oh.

460
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:56,454
Just take-take it all away.

461
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,457
LUCIFER:
A devil emoji?
That's it.

462
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,329
I'm speaking
to a copyright lawyer today.

463
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:03,458
CHLOE:
So Gillian cut off
your supply.

464
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,503
That must have pissed off
your dealer. Who is he?

465
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:06,858
I-I never met him.

466
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:08,126
All I have
is a number.

467
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,204
I'd text him,
he'd messenger me the drugs.

468
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:13,043
Okay, good.
I'm gonna need that number.

469
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:15,039
Okay. Thank you.

470
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:18,111
Okay, so the production company

471
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:20,751
confirms that they paid Gillian
under the table

472
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:22,477
to be Amy's sober companion.

473
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:23,452
That explains the cash.

474
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,050
I mean, I'm not saying
Amy's innocent,

475
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:26,451
but I don't see
a motive anymore.

476
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:30,153
Well, what about our
emoji-loving drug dealer?

477
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,286
Could be a show of strength.

478
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,061
Making sure no one screws
with him in the future.

479
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:36,689
I put a warrant in to locate
his cell phone, and, uh...

480
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:38,326
What?

481
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:39,701
Do you still think
this is about you?

482
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:41,729
Of course I do, but it's
worse than I thought.

483
00:16:41,735 --> 00:16:43,865
My mum is clearly
playing the long game.

484
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,870
Taunting me with my own
distorted image again and again.

485
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:50,443
No, really. Do you really think
the drug dealer is your mother?

486
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:52,983
Well, she's clever enough
to pull it all off.

487
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:54,609
What? You thought I
took after my dad?

488
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:58,154
Oh. You don't have to believe
anything I say, Detective.

489
00:16:58,151 --> 00:17:00,391
Test my blood.

490
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:03,687
Oh, dearie me, why
are you hesitating?

491
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,220
Scared to find out the truth?

492
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:06,555
I'm not scared about anything

493
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,089
other than finding out
what STDs you have.

494
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:10,555
Very funny.

495
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:12,563
(tires screeching)

496
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:19,543
(indistinct radio transmission)

497
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,539
Hey.

498
00:17:42,996 --> 00:17:44,026
Hey!

499
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,600
How did...?
What the hell

500
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:47,298
are you doing in here?

501
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,330
I'm sorry. I, uh...

502
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,596
I must have gotten lost.

503
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:59,639
(keys jingling)

504
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:01,306
Good night.

505
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:05,519
LINDA:
<i> You</i> don't<i> think</i>
<i> you deserve any of the blame</i>

506
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:07,048
<i> for what happened</i>
<i> with your mother?</i>

507
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:09,793
No. That's between her and Dad.

508
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:10,819
Then whose fault is it?

509
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:13,594
Well, I suppose
none of this would have happened

510
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,593
if Amenadiel had been
watching over Hell

511
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:16,455
like he was supposed to.

512
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:17,863
I thought that was your job.

513
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:21,034
Well, it was, but when
I abdicated, it became his.

514
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:23,174
Sort of like a game
of hot potato.

515
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:25,799
And then there's Maze.

516
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:26,995
And what about her?

517
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:28,166
Well, she's still missing.

518
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:29,744
See, I'm-I'm worried she might

519
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:31,442
be involved in all this.

520
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,714
Might explain why Mum was able

521
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:34,752
to hit the ground running
with my torment.

522
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:35,877
And

523
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:37,252
I wouldn't be in this mess

524
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,320
if it wasn't for the detective,

525
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:39,778
and she doesn't even know it!

526
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:40,846
And why is that?

527
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:44,324
Well, when I asked Father
for the favor, I...

528
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:45,794
(chuckles softly)

529
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,312
Look, it doesn't matter.

530
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:48,829
Even if I told her,
she wouldn't believe me anyway.

531
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:52,358
Sounds like there's a lot
of blame to go around.

532
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:53,325
Yes.

533
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,933
Is there anyone
you might be leaving out?

534
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:57,895
(sighs)
Anyone I'm leaving out.

535
00:18:57,904 --> 00:18:59,904
Um...

536
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:01,936
(clock ticking)

537
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:03,941
Oh, you're right.

538
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:05,313
Yes.

539
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,181
If you'd fixed
my existential problem earlier,

540
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,450
none of this
would have happened.

541
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:11,648
Well, good on you for taking
responsibility, Doctor.

542
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,921
It's very noble.

543
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,920
Ah.

544
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:18,122
(laughs)

545
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:23,586
I worry you're not gaining
<i> anything</i> from our sessions.

546
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:25,356
What do you mean?
Lately,

547
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:27,625
you're using our sessions
as an excuse

548
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:30,704
to misinterpret
what I say for your own gain.

549
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:32,373
(laughs)
What?

550
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:34,512
I don't think
I'm actually helping you.

551
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,107
Are you breaking up with me?

552
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:37,639
I'm asking
the question.

553
00:19:37,644 --> 00:19:40,214
Are our sessions
actually helping,

554
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:42,813
or just making things worse?

555
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:51,388
Lucifer?

556
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:54,261
You said you wanted to talk.

557
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,561
Hello, Chloe.

558
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:01,025
What's going on?

559
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:04,674
I was really hoping I wouldn't
have to do this, but...

560
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:07,411
recent developments have
left me with no other choice.

561
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:09,267
No other choice than to what?

562
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:11,305
You need to know
the truth, Chloe.

563
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:13,641
About Lucifer.

564
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:15,746
All right.

565
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:16,908
I'm listening.

566
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,746
Oh, I'm not gonna tell you.
I'm gonna show you.

567
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:23,748
What are you doing?

568
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:26,964
Amenadiel.
Amenadiel, no!

569
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:35,273
(gasping)

570
00:20:35,268 --> 00:20:37,538
Okay, you're gonna be fine.

571
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:39,737
I'm gonna call an ambulance.
You're gon...

572
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,469
(sighs)

573
00:20:43,276 --> 00:20:45,276
You c...

574
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:47,478
(panting)

575
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:51,378
You're... you're okay.

576
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:53,024
(panting)

577
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:55,989
How?

578
00:20:55,989 --> 00:20:58,919
Okay, this is going
to be hard for you to hear,

579
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:02,485
which is why I needed you
to see what Lucifer is.

580
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:05,496
No.

581
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:07,158
I don't believe it.

582
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,166
Good.

583
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:10,868
Because it's all a lie.

584
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,570
Bulletproof vest
and blood packs.

585
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:15,673
Are you insane?

586
00:21:15,675 --> 00:21:17,575
You could have
killed yourself!

587
00:21:17,577 --> 00:21:18,907
I was perfectly safe, Chloe.

588
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:20,541
This, by the way,
is what Lucifer wore

589
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:21,876
when you guys
confronted Malcolm.

590
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:23,711
How would you know that?
Because I put it on him.

591
00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:25,376
He knew what
he was walking into.

592
00:21:25,385 --> 00:21:29,845
Listen, everything that he does
is part of a performance.

593
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,860
All right.

594
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:35,189
Then what about the weird
mojo thing he does?

595
00:21:35,194 --> 00:21:36,734
Neural linguistic programming?

596
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:38,997
The power of suggestion?

597
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:41,268
Look, he studied it
at a very young age.

598
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:43,867
And I hate to admit this, but
he's actually really good at it.

599
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,600
What about the fact
that you two are brothers?

600
00:21:45,605 --> 00:21:48,635
Come on.
You've never heard of adoption?

601
00:21:49,776 --> 00:21:52,376
Why? Why would he do all this?

602
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:53,778
Listen,
what you have to understand

603
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,450
is that my brother and I had
a very difficult childhood.

604
00:21:56,449 --> 00:21:58,149
And to deal with
it, he created

605
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:01,921
this persona for himself--
Lucifer Morningstar, the Devil,

606
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:04,321
incorrigible and invincible.

607
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:05,594
So he's a liar?

608
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:07,261
Chloe, he means well,

609
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,630
but in the end, the only person

610
00:22:08,628 --> 00:22:10,828
he ever truly lies to
is himself.

611
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,204
(phone ringing)

612
00:22:14,901 --> 00:22:15,901
Decker.

613
00:22:15,902 --> 00:22:18,342
You tracked our
dealer's phone? Great.

614
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:20,098
I'm on my way.

615
00:22:20,106 --> 00:22:21,866
Any other questions?

616
00:22:21,874 --> 00:22:22,774
Yeah.

617
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:24,675
Why tell me all this now?

618
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:26,977
Because you needed to know.

619
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:32,323
MAN:
<i> When I woke up a week later,</i>

620
00:22:32,318 --> 00:22:35,318
they'd written in a...
a wisecracking neighbor.

621
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:38,821
You know, he-he got
all the best lines.

622
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:40,615
Your heart goes out to him,
doesn't it?

623
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:43,526
(sighs) A dealer
trying to find a buyer
at an AA meeting,

624
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,929
people at their
most vulnerable--
that's really low.

625
00:22:45,932 --> 00:22:49,102
Yeah. It's also not something
my mum would even care about.

626
00:22:49,102 --> 00:22:51,842
Because-- and I can't believe
I'm saying this--

627
00:22:51,838 --> 00:22:53,668
the killer isn't your mother.

628
00:22:53,673 --> 00:22:55,773
(sighs): Unfortunately,
I think you're right.

629
00:22:55,775 --> 00:22:58,405
Dear me, this has all been
a wild goose chase.

630
00:22:58,411 --> 00:23:00,641
Hey.

631
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:02,576
There's still a killer
out there, Lucifer.

632
00:23:02,582 --> 00:23:04,222
And we tracked his
phone to this room.

633
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:05,977
We've got to figure out
who the dealer is.

634
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:08,145
MAN:
It was the lowest
point in my life.

635
00:23:08,154 --> 00:23:09,494
Thanks, David.

636
00:23:09,489 --> 00:23:10,919
OTHERS:
Thanks, David.

637
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:13,993
All right, does anybody else
want to speak?
Yes,

638
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:16,593
I'd like to say something.

639
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:18,326
Thank you.

640
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,571
Hello.

641
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:27,099
My name is Lucifer Morningstar

642
00:23:27,106 --> 00:23:30,336
and I...

643
00:23:30,343 --> 00:23:31,983
<i> love</i> drugs.

644
00:23:31,978 --> 00:23:34,248
(people gasping)
Love them! Mmm!

645
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:36,447
Yummy, yummy, yummy.
Can't get enough.

646
00:23:36,449 --> 00:23:38,979
And... I've got lots of money...

647
00:23:38,985 --> 00:23:41,845
(sniffs) mmm,
that I love spending on drugs.

648
00:23:41,854 --> 00:23:43,994
Not even picky.
I'll do any of them.

649
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,360
Mix them together sometimes.
(chuckles)

650
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:48,359
You ever done a he-she?

651
00:23:48,361 --> 00:23:50,731
No? A neon nod? A donk?

652
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:53,030
Ah. Yeah, he knows
what I'm talking about.

653
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:55,032
That man has definitely donked.
Haven't you?

654
00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:58,104
Uh, the theme of the day
is your lowest point.

655
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:00,504
Right, my lowest point.
Well, geographically,

656
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:01,966
that would be Hell, of course.

657
00:24:01,974 --> 00:24:05,344
Hard to get much lower
than that. (chuckles)

658
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:08,953
And...

659
00:24:14,654 --> 00:24:18,164
Well, then I suppose it was
when my mother abandoned me.

660
00:24:21,027 --> 00:24:23,657
Turnabout was fair play, so I...

661
00:24:23,663 --> 00:24:26,103
abandoned her in turn.

662
00:24:26,098 --> 00:24:30,168
Didn't even give her a chance
to defend herself.

663
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:31,799
I mean, what
could she possibly say

664
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:34,174
that would justify what she did?

665
00:24:38,778 --> 00:24:41,108
What<i> would</i> she say?

666
00:24:47,053 --> 00:24:49,323
Well, that was a disaster.

667
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:51,362
Actually, I thought
that was really impressive.

668
00:24:51,357 --> 00:24:54,187
You did? It didn't
draw anyone out.
Yep.

669
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:55,793
That's not what
I was impressed with.

670
00:24:55,795 --> 00:24:57,455
Hey, guys.
Looking to score?

671
00:24:57,463 --> 00:25:00,703
Because I've got some
really good stuff,

672
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,170
if you've got cash.

673
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:03,668
Are we playing show and tell?

674
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,839
I got something to show you.

675
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:08,508
I actually found this on
the ground-- this isn't
even mine. I just...

676
00:25:08,508 --> 00:25:09,938
(grunts)

677
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:12,042
No, it-it really
isn't. I...

678
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:14,954
Oh, okay. Where-where
did those come from?

679
00:25:14,947 --> 00:25:16,947
Right. Now I've flushed out
your dealer,

680
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:18,419
do you mind if I...?

681
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:20,017
Knock yourself out.

682
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,220
Those really
are not mine.

683
00:25:22,221 --> 00:25:23,821
CHLOE:
Oh, of course they aren't.

684
00:25:23,823 --> 00:25:25,493
You don't really think
I could do that to someone?

685
00:25:25,491 --> 00:25:27,631
I think you were
pissed off that someone
blocked your meal ticket,

686
00:25:27,627 --> 00:25:29,957
and I think you were trying
to send a message, yeah.
Yeah,

687
00:25:29,962 --> 00:25:32,132
but I couldn't do<i> that.</i> That...

688
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:34,201
Oh, God.
Is that her skull?

689
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,230
(retches)
Can you take that away, please?

690
00:25:37,236 --> 00:25:39,166
Not until you tell me
what you know about...

691
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:41,141
(retches, coughs)

692
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,140
Oh, God.

693
00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:44,312
(exhales)

694
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,380
That poor girl.

695
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:49,613
All right, if
it wasn't you,

696
00:25:49,615 --> 00:25:52,845
then who would want to
make it look like it was?

697
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:57,446
If she had a dealer
before me, you know, I...

698
00:25:57,456 --> 00:26:01,256
I doubt... I doubt he was happy
I stole his best buyer.

699
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:04,895
Who was he?

700
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:07,127
â™ª â™ª

701
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:11,543
â™ª Go on, now, Scout,
and break with your man â™ª

702
00:26:11,537 --> 00:26:13,597
â™ª Please understand â™ª

703
00:26:13,606 --> 00:26:15,866
â™ª That you're in command â™ª

704
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:17,635
â™ª Do it for me â™ª

705
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:20,283
â™ª And do it for yourself â™ª

706
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,079
â™ª Come on â™ª

707
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:27,447
â™ª Are you for real? â™ª

708
00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:29,193
â™ª Or are you a dream? â™ª

709
00:26:29,188 --> 00:26:34,118
â™ª Scout, is it you
in this magazine? â™ª

710
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:36,186
â™ª Looking so mean... â™ª

711
00:26:36,195 --> 00:26:37,455
(grunts)

712
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:51,241
Oh, there you are, Maze.

713
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:52,843
I've missed you.

714
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:05,585
So, where the hell
have you been, Maze?

715
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:07,932
Away.

716
00:27:07,927 --> 00:27:09,327
Wonderfully vague,

717
00:27:09,328 --> 00:27:12,258
but you'll have to be a tad
more specific, I'm afraid.

718
00:27:12,264 --> 00:27:13,604
I needed you.

719
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:15,929
Oh.

720
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:18,274
So I'm supposed to just come
running whenever you need me?

721
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,740
Yes. That's exactly what
you're supposed to do.

722
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:24,170
And why is that?
Because since fire
and brimstone,

723
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:25,806
that's just how
it is between us.

724
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:27,241
Through thick and thin.

725
00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:30,246
So, come on. Where were you?

726
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:31,949
Shouldn't you be
more concerned

727
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:33,721
with the guy
I just saved you from?

728
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:37,219
Oh, please. I'm only vulnerable
when the detective is around.

729
00:27:37,223 --> 00:27:40,293
(low, muffled grunting nearby)

730
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:41,962
So, who is he?

731
00:27:41,961 --> 00:27:45,631
LUCIFER: Amy Dodd's
dick nozzle boyfriend.

732
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:49,871
She's the actress
from<i> Leave It... </i>
â™ª Leave it to Leslie. â™ª

733
00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:52,499
What? It makes me laugh.

734
00:27:52,505 --> 00:27:55,805
Well, he must have seen me
going into Amy's trailer
when I thought she was Mum.

735
00:27:55,808 --> 00:27:57,368
Jealous, were you?

736
00:27:57,376 --> 00:27:59,576
Wanted to prove yourself
to be a big boy

737
00:27:59,578 --> 00:28:00,978
by waving a knife in my face?

738
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,550
Wait, your mom escaped Hell?

739
00:28:02,548 --> 00:28:03,378
Yes.

740
00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:05,082
Funny timing,
isn't it?

741
00:28:05,084 --> 00:28:06,954
She slipped out whilst
Amenadiel was injured.

742
00:28:06,952 --> 00:28:08,052
And you, uh...

743
00:28:08,054 --> 00:28:10,154
Well, where were you, Maze?

744
00:28:10,156 --> 00:28:12,716
Wait, you think I'm helping her?

745
00:28:12,725 --> 00:28:14,015
Have you forgotten

746
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,026
who actually tortured her
in Hell?

747
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:19,228
Well, desperation makes
for strange bedfellows.

748
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,029
I've just pictured you in bed
with my mom.

749
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,295
Oh, I can't un-see that now.

750
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:28,514
So, Mama Morningstar's
on the loose.

751
00:28:28,507 --> 00:28:30,867
I never could
break that woman.

752
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:33,136
She wouldn't submit.

753
00:28:33,145 --> 00:28:35,705
Seems like I have
another chance.

754
00:28:35,715 --> 00:28:37,005
(low grunting)

755
00:28:37,016 --> 00:28:38,946
You sure
he doesn't know anything?

756
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,919
(grunts)
What is wrong with you people?!

757
00:28:41,921 --> 00:28:44,221
Yes, I'm sure.
Give me that.

758
00:28:45,758 --> 00:28:47,888
(muffled talking)

759
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:49,693
I think he would disagree.

760
00:28:50,496 --> 00:28:51,356
(muffled talking)

761
00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:52,233
Fine.

762
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:56,833
I know things...
about the murder.

763
00:28:56,836 --> 00:29:00,066
We found the drug dealer with
the adorable devil drawings.

764
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,172
Case closed.
You think Irwin killed her?

765
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:05,144
No, he'd never do that.
Maybe, maybe not. Don't care.

766
00:29:05,144 --> 00:29:06,684
You guys are with the cops,
though, right?

767
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:08,949
More of a day job thingy--
got much more pressing issues

768
00:29:08,948 --> 00:29:10,048
at the moment.

769
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:12,149
Right, seriously...

770
00:29:12,151 --> 00:29:14,951
if you weren't helping my mom,
then where were you?

771
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:18,519
(groans):
Ah...

772
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:22,933
I was with a friend.

773
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:24,158
Friend?

774
00:29:24,163 --> 00:29:25,563
Demons don't
have friends.

775
00:29:25,564 --> 00:29:29,034
Someone who's been helping me
do some...

776
00:29:30,236 --> 00:29:32,096
...soul-searching.

777
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,844
What, like hunting them
down and killing them?

778
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:35,739
(scoffs)
I wish.

779
00:29:35,741 --> 00:29:37,811
That would be a lot easier.

780
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:40,280
No.

781
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,748
Now that we are stuck here,
I need to figure out...

782
00:29:42,748 --> 00:29:44,348
where I fit in.

783
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,550
And she's been
helping me do that.

784
00:29:46,552 --> 00:29:48,352
(chuckling)

785
00:29:48,354 --> 00:29:50,924
Thanks. I knew
you wouldn't understand.

786
00:29:50,923 --> 00:29:53,093
I barely do.
(muffled talking)

787
00:29:53,092 --> 00:29:55,162
(continues
muffled talking)

788
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:57,331
What?

789
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:59,199
Amy had another drug dealer.

790
00:29:59,198 --> 00:30:00,358
Go on.
She used

791
00:30:00,366 --> 00:30:02,626
to score big from some other guy
before she got clean.

792
00:30:02,635 --> 00:30:04,635
But then Gillian
cut him off completely,

793
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:06,367
and the guy,
he was super pissed.

794
00:30:06,372 --> 00:30:08,572
Right, and where can I
find this<i> other</i> dealer?

795
00:30:08,574 --> 00:30:09,714
I don't know.

796
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:10,838
Oh...
No, I-I-I swear

797
00:30:10,843 --> 00:30:12,083
I've never met him.

798
00:30:12,077 --> 00:30:13,937
Look, he goes by the name of...

799
00:30:13,946 --> 00:30:15,306
of Bobby B.

800
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:17,678
Lovely.

801
00:30:18,951 --> 00:30:20,621
I thought you said

802
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:23,449
this case doesn't have anything
to do with your mom anymore.

803
00:30:23,455 --> 00:30:24,985
It doesn't.

804
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,190
Then why are you running off
to tell Chloe?

805
00:30:27,193 --> 00:30:30,663
Well, maybe there are things
you wouldn't understand
about me, either.

806
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:32,203
(scoffs)

807
00:30:35,668 --> 00:30:39,268
So you guys are gonna
let me go now, right?

808
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:42,767
Of course.

809
00:30:42,775 --> 00:30:43,805
(chuckles)

810
00:30:44,844 --> 00:30:47,284
After I've had my fun.

811
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,109
(indistinct radio transmission)

812
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:51,424
Ah, there you are!
Oh, hey.

813
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:53,717
I've got some news
on the case.
Oh, me, too.

814
00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:55,569
But go on.
Ladies first.

815
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:57,420
Well, our drug dealer's
alibi is still shaky.

816
00:30:57,423 --> 00:30:59,823
Uh, but he did mention
there's another dealer.

817
00:30:59,825 --> 00:31:02,485
Oh. That's what<i> I</i> had.
And Amy's lawyered up,

818
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:04,434
so we can't get
anything out of her.

819
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,300
And all we have on
this "other dealer"

820
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:08,168
is that he's selling
prescription pills.

821
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:09,397
Oxys. Percocet.

822
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:11,971
Oh, not my faves, but
they'll do in a pinch.

823
00:31:11,971 --> 00:31:14,711
So if the story stands,
we're looking for someone
in health care: doctor,

824
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:16,837
pharmacist.
I'm gonna go through
these booking sheets

825
00:31:16,842 --> 00:31:20,142
for anyone in the medical
industry that's been charged
in the last couple years.

826
00:31:20,145 --> 00:31:21,575
Right.

827
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:24,050
Feel free
to jump in and help me.

828
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,119
(groans)

829
00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:27,724
Joy of joys.

830
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,520
Oh, there is one thing
that might help.

831
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:32,092
Yeah, what's that?

832
00:31:34,994 --> 00:31:36,834
Bobby B.

833
00:31:36,829 --> 00:31:38,829
What's that?

834
00:31:38,831 --> 00:31:41,571
She was like a mother to her.

835
00:31:43,202 --> 00:31:45,242
I have some issues
that I need to work out,

836
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:47,467
and I think
I know just how to do it.

837
00:31:49,508 --> 00:31:51,678
What?

838
00:31:51,677 --> 00:31:54,877
(Maze laughing)

839
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,120
MAZE:
Oh...
What is wrong
with you people!

840
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:04,885
(exhales)

841
00:32:05,958 --> 00:32:07,258
(chuckles)

842
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,260
So you're back.

843
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:15,829
I'm here.

844
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:17,374
I wouldn't say I'm back.

845
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:19,239
You know I was looking
for you, right?

846
00:32:19,238 --> 00:32:21,198
After what happened?

847
00:32:21,206 --> 00:32:23,306
Maze, what you did
for me was...

848
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:24,879
(laughs softly)

849
00:32:25,878 --> 00:32:27,538
But you were gone.

850
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:31,476
I needed to get away
from Lucifer.

851
00:32:31,483 --> 00:32:32,553
And you.

852
00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:35,221
I need to
figure out

853
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,690
where I fit in in this world.
And to do that,

854
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,360
I need some space.

855
00:32:39,358 --> 00:32:40,758
From the both of you.

856
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:42,989
Yeah.

857
00:32:42,995 --> 00:32:44,995
No, I mean, I was...

858
00:32:44,997 --> 00:32:46,657
feeling the same thing,
you know?

859
00:32:46,665 --> 00:32:48,395
I think some distance
between us

860
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,470
might be a good thing.

861
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:15,628
Hey, can I ask you a question?

862
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:16,427
Shoot.

863
00:33:16,428 --> 00:33:18,698
Do you really believe in God?

864
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:22,795
Whoa. I was expecting
more like,

865
00:33:22,801 --> 00:33:25,201
"Hey, Ella, what's it like
moving from Detroit to L.A.?"

866
00:33:25,204 --> 00:33:28,414
"Hey, Ella, how'd you survive
growing up with four brothers?"

867
00:33:28,407 --> 00:33:30,907
But the big "G" question
right off the top--

868
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:33,179
did not see that coming.

869
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,437
Okay, sorry, it's inappropriate.
Oh, no, no, no.
I actually

870
00:33:35,447 --> 00:33:37,707
really like talking about it.
It's my faith.

871
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:40,146
It's kind of a big part
of my life.

872
00:33:40,152 --> 00:33:43,652
So, uh, yeah, sure. Uh, hit me.

873
00:33:43,655 --> 00:33:45,315
Okay.

874
00:33:45,324 --> 00:33:48,064
Do you believe
that it all really exists?

875
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,030
What do you mean?

876
00:33:49,028 --> 00:33:50,758
Say, angels.

877
00:33:50,763 --> 00:33:52,003
Or the Devil.

878
00:33:51,997 --> 00:33:54,767
That sort of thing.
That's all a metaphor, right?

879
00:33:54,767 --> 00:33:56,667
Maybe.

880
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:57,928
Maybe not.

881
00:33:57,936 --> 00:33:59,836
Oh, okay. That's pretty...

882
00:33:59,838 --> 00:34:01,868
I just thought
there would be more faith

883
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:03,214
in your faith, I guess.

884
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:05,608
Oh. No, see, my aunt
was a nun, okay?

885
00:34:05,611 --> 00:34:07,741
And she always taught me that
doubt was really important.

886
00:34:07,746 --> 00:34:09,876
Right? I mean,
if you don't question something,

887
00:34:09,882 --> 00:34:12,182
then what's the point
of believing it?

888
00:34:12,184 --> 00:34:13,054
Mm-hmm.

889
00:34:13,052 --> 00:34:14,322
I doubt

890
00:34:14,319 --> 00:34:16,349
so that I can believe.

891
00:34:16,355 --> 00:34:17,515
So, then, if you had the chance

892
00:34:17,523 --> 00:34:19,723
to prove
it was all real or fake,

893
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:20,655
would you do it?

894
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:23,089
I mean,
that kind of defeats the point,

895
00:34:23,095 --> 00:34:25,925
don't you think? It's faith...

896
00:34:25,931 --> 00:34:27,601
Roses.

897
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,629
What? What do roses have
to do with faith?
No,

898
00:34:30,636 --> 00:34:31,896
nothing to do with faith.

899
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:34,074
And everything to do
with the case.

900
00:34:34,073 --> 00:34:36,943
Um, okay, so I-I found
nitrogen, right, on the rods

901
00:34:36,942 --> 00:34:39,412
in the victim's head,
and-and it got me thinking.

902
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:42,381
It could be almost
anything. And then I found

903
00:34:42,381 --> 00:34:43,651
the capital "K."

904
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:45,649
Capital "K"?
Potassium? Periodic table?

905
00:34:45,651 --> 00:34:47,081
Why don't you just skip
to the end?

906
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:49,216
And... rose fertilizer.

907
00:34:49,221 --> 00:34:52,721
Which also has nitrogen.

908
00:34:52,724 --> 00:34:55,034
So the rods were taken
from a garden.

909
00:34:55,027 --> 00:34:56,257
Exactly.

910
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:57,661
Garden tools,

911
00:34:57,663 --> 00:34:59,803
lawn accessories...
Like flamingos.

912
00:34:59,798 --> 00:35:02,198
Well, yeah, I mean,
that's oddly specific,

913
00:35:02,201 --> 00:35:04,601
but, yeah,
flamingos...
Thank you. Thank you.

914
00:35:14,413 --> 00:35:16,283
Mr. Morningstar.

915
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:18,421
Hello, murderer.

916
00:35:18,417 --> 00:35:20,247
Murderer?

917
00:35:20,252 --> 00:35:21,522
(door shuts)

918
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,090
I don't...
I don't understand.

919
00:35:23,088 --> 00:35:26,088
Oh, Roberta, can we skip the
boring part where you deny it

920
00:35:26,091 --> 00:35:30,391
and just, uh... Let's get
to the good stuff, shall we?

921
00:35:30,395 --> 00:35:33,025
Does it help
if I call you Bobby B.?

922
00:35:33,031 --> 00:35:34,561
What are you talking about?

923
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:36,796
Oh. Oh, it's very simple.

924
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:38,542
You stole drugs
from the hospital

925
00:35:38,537 --> 00:35:39,797
and sold them to Amy Dodd,

926
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,705
your biggest client,
who you met on set.

927
00:35:41,707 --> 00:35:44,437
You introduced Gillian
to Amy, got her the job.

928
00:35:44,443 --> 00:35:47,043
But then she helped Amy
get sober.

929
00:35:47,045 --> 00:35:49,145
You felt betrayed,
yadda yadda yadda,

930
00:35:49,148 --> 00:35:51,918
you killed her. Then you tried
to frame her new dealer.

931
00:35:51,917 --> 00:35:53,047
Am I getting close?

932
00:35:53,051 --> 00:35:54,181
That's ludicrous.

933
00:35:54,186 --> 00:35:56,446
No. No, what's ludicrous

934
00:35:56,455 --> 00:35:58,155
is that you were like a mother
to her,

935
00:35:58,157 --> 00:36:00,717
and you sacrificed her
like she was nothing.

936
00:36:00,726 --> 00:36:03,956
Did she mean so little
to you in the end?

937
00:36:03,962 --> 00:36:06,302
Really? Tell me,

938
00:36:06,298 --> 00:36:08,568
why would you do that? Why?

939
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:09,967
You need to go now.

940
00:36:09,968 --> 00:36:11,068
Tell me why.

941
00:36:11,069 --> 00:36:12,299
Stay back.

942
00:36:12,304 --> 00:36:13,604
You plunged two rods
into her skull

943
00:36:13,605 --> 00:36:15,335
to make her look like the
Devil. But, you know what,

944
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,770
she's not the Devil-- I am.

945
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:18,535
Oh, ho, ho, ho!
There we go!

946
00:36:18,544 --> 00:36:21,914
I love a game of poker. Go on,
I'll give you a freebie,
just to make it interesting.

947
00:36:21,914 --> 00:36:23,254
(grunts)

948
00:36:23,248 --> 00:36:25,618
(panting)

949
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:27,817
How is this possi...?
(grunts)

950
00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:28,989
(shouting)

951
00:36:33,759 --> 00:36:34,989
(shouting)
(panting)

952
00:36:34,993 --> 00:36:37,263
All right. Okay. Can we just...

953
00:36:37,262 --> 00:36:40,432
(grunts)
have a-a time-out, please?

954
00:36:44,303 --> 00:36:45,743
(grunting)

955
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:47,137
(choking)

956
00:36:47,139 --> 00:36:49,939
Is this
a supernatural fire poker?

957
00:36:49,942 --> 00:36:53,482
How is this possible?
(knocking)

958
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:56,408
Mrs. Beliard,
it's Detective Decker.

959
00:36:56,415 --> 00:36:58,415
Bloody hell.
Of course she's here.

960
00:36:58,417 --> 00:37:01,377
Detective!
Detective, you need to leave.
(doorbell ringing)

961
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:06,056
(shushing) It's gonna
be over real soon.
(choking)

962
00:37:11,663 --> 00:37:15,133
I know someone's in there.
I can wait out here all day.

963
00:37:15,133 --> 00:37:17,673
I took in that girl
and I gave her a job

964
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:20,899
and then she cut me off
from my best customer.

965
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:24,466
So, yeah, I put three inches
of steel into her brain.

966
00:37:24,476 --> 00:37:25,936
And I actually liked her.

967
00:37:25,944 --> 00:37:28,214
LUCIFER (groans):
Please.

968
00:37:28,213 --> 00:37:30,413
Please don't...
(grunts)

969
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:31,615
please...
What?

970
00:37:31,617 --> 00:37:33,647
What, you're gonna beg
for your life, huh?

971
00:37:33,652 --> 00:37:36,392
...don't tell anyone...
(grunts)

972
00:37:36,388 --> 00:37:38,658
that I died like this.

973
00:37:38,657 --> 00:37:40,687
(choking)

974
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:42,392
(panting)

975
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:43,364
Just...
(coughs)

976
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,130
(Taser clicking)
(shouts)

977
00:37:49,635 --> 00:37:51,195
(panting)

978
00:37:52,671 --> 00:37:54,271
Nearly had her.

979
00:37:54,273 --> 00:37:56,313
(grunts)

980
00:37:56,308 --> 00:37:58,108
Yeah.

981
00:38:01,546 --> 00:38:04,146
(Taser clicking)

982
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:09,919
(siren wailing in distance)

983
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:15,234
I'm never living
this down, am I?

984
00:38:15,227 --> 00:38:18,157
Not if I have anything
to say about it.

985
00:38:18,163 --> 00:38:21,003
You know, you weren't there
when Ella's forensic report

986
00:38:20,999 --> 00:38:22,669
pointed us at Roberta.

987
00:38:22,668 --> 00:38:23,968
So how'd you put this together?

988
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:26,039
Well, I was on
the Devil's business, Detective.

989
00:38:27,506 --> 00:38:29,236
(chuckles)
Look, even if I told you,

990
00:38:29,241 --> 00:38:30,941
you'd just say
I was being crazy.

991
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:33,112
Hmm. That's funny.

992
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:35,211
That's what your brother
was just saying about you.

993
00:38:35,213 --> 00:38:37,313
Oh. Amenadiel talked
to you, did he?

994
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:39,576
He did.
He explained everything.

995
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:42,794
Was very impressive.
Filled in all the gaps.

996
00:38:42,788 --> 00:38:44,318
But?

997
00:38:44,323 --> 00:38:46,323
(sighs)
But I don't buy it.

998
00:38:47,292 --> 00:38:48,562
I don't accept
that you're crazy,

999
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,960
and I don't accept
this "Devil's business" either.

1000
00:38:50,962 --> 00:38:52,162
All right,
so what do you believe?

1001
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:53,904
That I need the eggs.

1002
00:38:53,899 --> 00:38:55,369
Excuse me?

1003
00:38:55,367 --> 00:38:58,227
It's an old joke. Guy walks
into a psychiatrist's office,

1004
00:38:58,236 --> 00:39:00,136
he goes,
"Doc, you got to help me.

1005
00:39:00,138 --> 00:39:02,008
My brother's crazy.
He thinks he's a chicken."

1006
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:03,967
(chuckles)
And the doc goes,
"Well, why don't

1007
00:39:03,975 --> 00:39:05,435
you turn him in?" The guy goes,

1008
00:39:05,444 --> 00:39:09,484
"You know, I would,
but I need the eggs."

1009
00:39:09,481 --> 00:39:10,851
That's not very funny.

1010
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:11,849
Yeah.

1011
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,580
(sighs)

1012
00:39:13,585 --> 00:39:16,045
Look,

1013
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:18,464
I don't know what your deal is,

1014
00:39:18,457 --> 00:39:20,887
but you make me
a better detective.

1015
00:39:20,892 --> 00:39:23,632
And you've
always got my back.

1016
00:39:23,628 --> 00:39:26,598
What more could I ask for?

1017
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:31,868
And you need the eggs.

1018
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:34,500
Damn right I do.

1019
00:39:34,506 --> 00:39:36,506
(knocking)

1020
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:39,079
Lucifer.

1021
00:39:39,077 --> 00:39:40,637
We don't have an appointment.

1022
00:39:40,645 --> 00:39:42,645
No.

1023
00:39:42,647 --> 00:39:45,077
No, we don't. I, uh...

1024
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:48,823
I just wanted
to drop by and say...

1025
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,650
thank you.

1026
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:53,015
And why's that?

1027
00:39:53,024 --> 00:39:54,664
Because you were right.

1028
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:56,059
I've been blaming everybody else

1029
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:57,831
for the situation I'm in.
And the fact of the matter

1030
00:39:57,829 --> 00:40:00,359
is that...

1031
00:40:00,365 --> 00:40:03,065
(sighs)
I chose to do nothing

1032
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:04,928
when my mother was cast out.

1033
00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:07,796
To never ask her
why she did what she did.

1034
00:40:07,806 --> 00:40:09,036
So that's on me.

1035
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,980
That's good, Lucifer.

1036
00:40:12,811 --> 00:40:15,081
No.

1037
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,980
No, it's not.

1038
00:40:16,982 --> 00:40:18,522
Why do you
say that?

1039
00:40:18,517 --> 00:40:20,517
Well, I've assumed
a lot about my mother,

1040
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:22,149
including the fact
that she wants revenge

1041
00:40:22,154 --> 00:40:23,694
for what I did
to her.

1042
00:40:23,688 --> 00:40:26,818
And now she doesn't?
Well, it doesn't
appear so, no.

1043
00:40:26,825 --> 00:40:28,485
And why is that
a bad thing?

1044
00:40:28,493 --> 00:40:31,133
Well, because, Doctor,
if she's not coming to kill me,

1045
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:32,959
then I don't know
what she's doing.

1046
00:40:32,964 --> 00:40:35,474
And...

1047
00:40:35,467 --> 00:40:37,427
(sighs)

1048
00:40:37,436 --> 00:40:39,796
...that's truly terrifying.

1049
00:40:39,805 --> 00:40:42,205
(piano playing
"All Along the Watchtower")

1050
00:40:48,547 --> 00:40:53,547
LUCIFER:
â™ª There must be some kind of way
out of here â™ª

1051
00:40:53,552 --> 00:40:56,792
â™ª Said the joker to the thief â™ª

1052
00:40:56,788 --> 00:41:01,288
â™ª There's too much confusion
now â™ª

1053
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:05,503
â™ª I can't get no relief â™ª

1054
00:41:05,497 --> 00:41:07,497
â™ª â™ª

1055
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:18,442
â™ª No reason to get excited â™ª

1056
00:41:18,443 --> 00:41:22,413
â™ª The thief, he kindly spoke â™ª

1057
00:41:22,414 --> 00:41:27,354
â™ª There are many here among us â™ª

1058
00:41:27,352 --> 00:41:30,722
â™ª Who feel life's but a joke â™ª

1059
00:41:30,722 --> 00:41:35,832
â™ª But you and I,
we've been through that â™ª

1060
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:39,497
â™ª And this is not our fate â™ª

1061
00:41:39,498 --> 00:41:44,428
â™ª So let us stop talkin'
falsely now â™ª

1062
00:41:44,436 --> 00:41:49,806
â™ª The hour's getting late, hey â™ª

1063
00:41:49,808 --> 00:41:51,808
â™ª â™ª

1064
00:41:56,448 --> 00:42:00,918
â™ª All along the watchtower â™ª

1065
00:42:00,919 --> 00:42:03,889
â™ª Princes kept the view â™ª

1066
00:42:03,889 --> 00:42:06,669
â™ª â™ª

1067
00:42:06,674 --> 00:42:09,464
â™ª While all the women,
they came and they went â™ª

1068
00:42:09,461 --> 00:42:12,931
â™ª Barefoot servants, too â™ª

1069
00:42:12,931 --> 00:42:17,331
â™ª Outside in the cold distance â™ª

1070
00:42:17,335 --> 00:42:22,105
â™ª A wildcat did growl â™ª

1071
00:42:22,107 --> 00:42:26,237
â™ª Two riders were approaching â™ª

1072
00:42:26,244 --> 00:42:32,584
â™ª And the wind began
to howl... â™ª

1073
00:42:32,584 --> 00:42:34,584
â™ª â™ª

1074
00:42:43,161 --> 00:42:45,831
(elevator bell dings)

1075
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:49,630
Oh. Didn't realize
I had an audience.

1076
00:42:49,634 --> 00:42:52,674
Is there anything
I can do for you?

1077
00:42:56,107 --> 00:42:58,307
(panting)

1078
00:43:01,012 --> 00:43:02,612
Lucifer.

1079
00:43:02,614 --> 00:43:03,884
Mum.

1080
00:43:03,882 --> 00:43:05,782
Help me.

1081
00:43:06,718 --> 00:43:08,588
(panting)
