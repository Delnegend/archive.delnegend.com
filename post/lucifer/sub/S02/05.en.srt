00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:04,470
So, we're still good
     to be roomies, right?

3
00:00:04,472 --> 00:00:05,504
What are you talking about,
            roomies?

4
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:06,638
We shook on it.

5
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,108
You shall remain
                     right here,

6
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,542
on Earth, amongst the creatures

7
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:12,111
you so despise.

8
00:00:12,113 --> 00:00:13,679
Existing in this punishment

9
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:16,281
allows me to be
closer to my family.

10
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:18,017
You made a deal to return Mom
            to Hell.

11
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:20,953
In exchange, Chloe's life
          was spared.

12
00:00:20,955 --> 00:00:22,287
You still haven't delivered

13
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:23,455
on your end of the bargain.

14
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:24,556
If you're so concerned,

15
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:26,458
why don't you just
fly Mum back to Hell?

00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:22,514
to pick up that

        No, you're not.

Are you certain?
              Yes.

55
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,731
But you didn't see anything
 strange or out of the ordinary?

56
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:14,099
Like I told you at the hospital

57
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:16,301
and several times before that,
              no.

58
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:17,402
What's going on with you?

59
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:19,238
(sighs)
   Well, there's a miniscule,

60
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,940
albeit highly unlikely, chance
     that your car accident

61
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:25,144
was a result of my father
  trying to send me a message.

62
00:02:25,146 --> 00:02:27,279
Lucifer, it was
a freak accident.

63
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:29,014
A dog ran into the middle
          of the road.

64
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:30,582
You had nothing to do with it.

65
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:32,451
Right. Okay.

66
00:02:32,453 --> 00:02:34,920
Well, you're about to be
  in another disastrous wreck

67
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:35,988
that is avoidable.

68
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,956
What?
               Living with Maze.

69
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,958
Potential for sexy pillow
         fights notwithstanding,

70
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,562
you and Maze are like snow pants
         and elephants.

71
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:46,298
You don't mix.
Maze and I

72
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,467
have become friends.

73
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:50,002
Sort of.

74
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:51,770
And I think it's gonna be fine.

75
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:54,139
Oh, really?

76
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:56,608
With a short adjustment period.
                             Mm.

77
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,277
(phone ringing)
Yeah. What is that?

78
00:02:58,279 --> 00:03:00,078
Decker.

79
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:02,447

                    Hi, Lucifer.

00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,950
Ah, um, toys.

82
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:06,451
In there. Go.
Yes.

83
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:07,986
Thank you.
               Can you read this

84
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:09,121
to me, Mommy?
(sighs)

85
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:10,322
No, Monkey.

86
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:11,857
I just got a new case.
   You have to get to school.

87
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,725
And besides,
   that's your bedtime story.

88
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:14,826
I'll read that to you tonight.

89
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:17,462
No, read it to me now!

90
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:18,997
This-- best birth control
         in the world.

91
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:20,098
CHLOE:
Come here.

92
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:25,170
What's going on, kiddo?

93
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:27,806
Landa says your job's
       really dangerous.

94
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:30,242
That cops get hurt all the time.

95
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:31,710
I don't want you to get hurt.

96
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,178
Oh, baby.

97
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,248
The car accident was just that--

98
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,316
an accident.

99
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:39,818
And Mommy's job can
be dangerous, but

100
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,520
I'm really careful, okay?

101
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:42,654
I'm not gonna get hurt.

102
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:44,223
I love you, Mom.

103
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:45,824
Oh, I love you so much.

104
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:47,893
I love you.

105
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,362
Oh, no, actually, this
        is better birth control.

106
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:51,830

          <i> Hey, Ella.</i>

109
00:03:57,838 --> 00:03:59,104
Hey.

110
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:00,939
All right, any I.D.
         on the victim?

111
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:02,107
Uh, yep.

112
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:03,542
His name is...
              It's Wesley Cabot!

113
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:05,177
What? How do you
                      know that?

114
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:06,378
How do I know th--

115
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,547
Star of the
              <i> Body Bags</i> movies.

116
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:10,682
Eighth-degree black belt.

117
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:12,918
Absolute icon
      in the action genre.

118
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,920
I adore his work.

119
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:17,289
It's just a bunch of people
pretending to punch each other.

120
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,691
(scoffs) It's much more
     than that, Detective.

121
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:21,693
It's a chance to escape
   your reality for a moment.

122
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:23,762
Some people need that.

123
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:28,033
Also, ninjas and tons of nudity
   in the first three, so...

124
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:30,035
He had a drug problem, right?
Well, only if you consider

125
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:33,272
ingesting millions of dollars'
  worth of cocaine a problem.

126
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:34,373
I call it a Tuesday.

127
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,108
But, apparently,
       it's frowned upon.

128
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,744
Yeah, so no studios would
       hire him anymore.

129
00:04:38,746 --> 00:04:40,045
Hmm.

130
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:42,547
No wonder he resorted to
 teaching karate in Hollywood.

131
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:43,582
Yeah.

132
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:45,050
CHLOE:
 Looks like he was living here.

133
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:46,485
And I thought I fell a long way.

134
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:49,087
ELLA: Okay, so body temp's
cooled five degrees.

135
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:51,156
That pegs time of death
        around 7:00 a.m.

136
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:53,058
Doesn't look like there's
              any money missing.

137
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,593
No forced entry.

138
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:56,261
It's not a robbery.

139
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:57,262
What's the cause of death?

140
00:04:57,264 --> 00:04:59,598
ELLA:
Dude was hit with a...

141
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,166
"nunchuck statue"?

142
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:02,734
That's a first for me.

143
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:06,972
"The Golden Nunchuck Award
for Best Fight Sequence, 1998."

144
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,740
So, you think the award
              came from the box?

145
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:11,109
Yep. It's got all of
Wesley's<i> Body Bags 4</i> swag.

146
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:13,612
Memorabilia, contracts.
Once I get all this

147
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:15,914
back to the precinct,
I'll see what I can find.

148
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,449
For the Insta.

149
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:18,617
No!

150
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:19,818
No?
                           Nope.

151
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,353
Not cool.
             Uh...

152
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:22,587
Oh, hold on.

153
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:24,756
I know who the killer must be.

154
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,591
Who?

155
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:29,294
The dreaded ninja Ozaki,
 from<i> Body Bags 6: Tokyo Fire.</i>

156
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:31,596
I mean, who else would get
   the jump on Wesley Cabot?

157
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:34,933
(sighs)
       I will avenge you.

158
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:37,102
Who found the body?

159
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:38,303
A kid.

160
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:40,005
Said he saw a Hummer
         driving away.

161
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,273
Here you go.
             Hmm?

162
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:42,541
I'll see if
                 he saw a plate.

163
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:45,644
Hey, Lucifer.

164
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:46,645
Yes?

165
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:48,146
So I was wondering...
                           Okay,

166
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:50,148
all right, but, uh, we'll need
    to be discreet about it,

167
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,183
'cause the detective hates it

168
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:52,451
when I mix business
         with pleasure.

169
00:05:52,453 --> 00:05:54,286
The, uh, bed in there
     looks a little skanky,

170
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:55,787
but I'm up for it if you are.

171
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:57,556
Uh, wow.

172
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:59,224
Okay. Yeah.
                      (chuckles)

173
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:00,492
Okay.
          I mean, no!

174
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:01,793
Oh.
I was just wondering,

175
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:04,329
why do you like
 this Wesley Cabot guy so much?

176
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:07,399
Well, he rips men's hearts out,

177
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:08,800
wipes out entire villages,

178
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:10,001
never says thank you,

179
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:11,503
and he's applauded for it.

180
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:14,639
Oh, him... as opposed to you.

181
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:16,074
That's right, because you're the

182
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:17,075
(whispering):
          son of God.

183
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:18,076
Exactly.
     (clicks tongue)

184
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:19,344
Yes.
I get it.

185
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:21,246
I mean, Stanislavksy
  would be very proud of you.

186
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:24,316
Okay, for the last time,
    I am not a method actor.

187
00:06:24,318 --> 00:06:25,684
So method of you to say.

188
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:26,651
Damn, you are good.

189
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:28,587
Hey, can you cry on cue?

190
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:31,890
Sorry, excuse me.

191
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,793
(horn honking)

192
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:51,510
MAN:
Hello, brother.

193
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:53,111
LUCIFER:
              Ah.

194
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:54,746
Uriel!

195
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,248
I thought it was you.

196
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,283
Welcome to Earth.

197
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:00,719
Clearly, I got the fashion sense
         in the family.

198
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:02,421
Word of advice:
       I'd lose the trench coat,

199
00:07:02,423 --> 00:07:03,522
'cause as it stands,

200
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:05,223
it's less cool,
                 brooding angel,

201
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:06,558
more sort of
               "pedophile chic."

202
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,860
One joke down. One to go.
                      (chuckles)

203
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:11,029
Why can't you take anything
      seriously, Lucifer?

204
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:12,030
What do they say?

205
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:13,532
Laugh like no one's listening?

206
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:15,033
Dance like you're standing
         on the corpses

207
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:16,034
of your enemies?

208
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:17,769
And there's the other.

209
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,371
Predictable as ever.

210
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:20,906
What do you want, Uriel?

211
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:22,040
I came to you tell you

212
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,875
that you have 24 hours.

213
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:26,545
I'll bite. 24 hours or what?

214
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:28,213
Either return here
with Mom,

215
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:30,982
or I'll finish what I started
      with your detective.

216
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,653
The car accident.

217
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,754
You made a deal with Dad.

218
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:38,557
Time to pay up. So...

219
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:40,559
bring Mom to me,

220
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:43,161
or I'll take back what Dad
           gave you.

221
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:51,870
¶ ¶

222
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,646
Uriel is here?

223
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,615
Pleasant aroma and all.

224
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:04,616
And he's after Chloe?

225
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:05,617
MAZE:
No.

226
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:07,085
He's after Chloe

227
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:09,688
or that classy bitch
        you call "Mom."

228
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,756
You made a deal with Daddy.

229
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:12,824
Time to pay up.

230
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:13,959
(scoffs)
Uriel can come after

231
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:15,660
celestial beings like us, yes,

232
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,262
but angels aren't allowed
        to kill humans.

233
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:18,797
Chloe should be safe.
                            Yes,

234
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:19,831
but remember, dear brother,

235
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,833
that Uriel can play
         with patterns.

236
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,435
He makes a butterfly
         flap its wings

237
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:26,338
and a housewife gets chlamydia.

238
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,274
Or Chloe gets into a seemingly
     accidental car wreck.

239
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:31,109
Correct, for ten points.

240
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:32,444
Well, too bad there isn't
          an easy way

241
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:33,979
to make this all go away.

242
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:36,214
Oh, wait, there is.

243
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:37,949
Send your mom back to Hell.

244
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:38,783
(chuckles)
                      A solution

245
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:39,818
which you

246
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,620
will, no doubt, avoid.

247
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:43,522
Well, worry not,
  my little sex thug, because

248
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:45,724
Uriel won't be a problem.

249
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:47,092
We have a nuclear weapon.

250
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:49,194
What's that?

251
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,495
You.

252
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:52,130
Well, Uriel doesn't know that

253
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:53,398
we're working together on this.

254
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,833
We all know he won't
listen to me.

255
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:57,636
But he will if it's someone
      from the home team.

256
00:08:57,638 --> 00:09:00,338
So, you will go and convince him

257
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,840
that he needs to go back.

258
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:04,476
Or, you know, just punch him
       in his smug face.

259
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:05,677
Dealer's choice.

260
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:06,745
(chuckling)

261
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:08,146
God, it's nice

262
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:10,215
having a super powerful angel
    on your side, isn't it?

263
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:13,652
Good luck with that.

264
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:19,090
CHLOE:
              Huh.

265
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:20,492
Saved your life.

266
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:22,360
(chuckling):
Maybe. You never know.

267
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:23,495
What are you talking about?

268
00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:24,496
Well, it appears

269
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:25,697
that I was correct this morning.

270
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:28,500
You are being targeted
       by cosmic forces.

271
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:29,534
But fear not,

272
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:30,835
it's all being dealt with.

273
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:31,870
And I'm here.

274
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:33,772
CHLOE:
             Now...

275
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:35,173
what is with everyone

276
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:36,508
and this car accident? I'm fine.

277
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,709
No, I'm afraid that you're not.

278
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:39,444
And so, for the next day or so,

279
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:41,680
I'm gonna need you to be
         unpredictable.

280
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:43,281
Whatever you'd normally do,
        just, you know--

281
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:45,016
ah, ah--
                do the opposite.

282
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:46,251
Too bad.

283
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,019
I was totally gonna have sex
        with you today.

284
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:50,455
Really?

285
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:53,291
Oh. Well played, Detective.
           (chuckles)

286
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:55,694
Yes, but until the threat
                     has passed,

287
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:56,861
just to be safe,

288
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:58,196
I won't be leaving your side.

289
00:09:58,198 --> 00:09:59,798
So just think of me

290
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,566
as your Guardian Devil.

291
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:03,368
(softly):
             Okay.

292
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,369
Guys, Wesley Cabot's dead.

293
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:05,537
I can't believe it.

294
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:07,072
Oh, God. Not you, too.

295
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:09,374
Oh, man.<i> Body Bags</i>
                   <i> 1</i> through<i> 6.</i>

296
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:11,209
First in line. I mean,
              I even skipped out

297
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:13,478
on some of our wedding planning
 to see<i> Body Bags 6.</i> Remember?

298
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,913
That was the big emergency?

299
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,881
It was totally worth it.
           It was a great movie.

300
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:18,550
Yes, it was.
Better catch phrase, wasn't it?

301
00:10:18,552 --> 00:10:19,884
BOTH:
       "Not on my watch."

302
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:20,885
(both chuckling)

303
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:22,287
Maybe I should get
        a catch phrase.

304
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,222
You don't need a catch phrase.
            And you.

305
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:26,224
Do you have anything
      constructive to add?

306
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:28,793
Uh, yep.
                      Yep, I do.

307
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:31,563
The boy who, uh, found the body

308
00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:34,065
remembered the first three plate
  numbers of the getaway car.

309
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:35,500
13 matches.

310
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:36,935
13. That's a lot of legwork.

311
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:38,570
Jamie Lee Adrienne.

312
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:40,171
The, uh, the Playmate?

313
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:41,339
The ex-party girl?
                           Yeah.

314
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:42,841
What does she have to do
       with Wesley Cabot?

315
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:45,076
She's his ex-wife. They met
   on the set of<i> Body Bags 4.</i>

316
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:46,845
Apparently , Jamie and
    Wesley's divorce proceedings

317
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:48,346
were very contentious.

318
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:50,749
Maybe she went
               to "renegotiate."

319
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,283
(Lucifer and Dan chuckling)

320
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:53,852
By "renegotiate",
                I mean kill him.

321
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:55,654
Yeah.
                 Uh...

322
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,056
Yeah.

323
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:02,794
I can't believe
Wesley's really gone.

324
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:04,763
When was the last time
       you saw Mr. Cabot?

325
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:07,966
Um... a few weeks ago.

326
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:08,967
Maybe.

327
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:10,335
Interesting.

328
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:13,138
Then can you explain why
a witness said that they saw you

329
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,440
speeding away from Wesley's
              dojo this morning?

330
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:18,977
Welcome to Devil Time.

331
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:20,612
What are you doing?
                   Trying out my
               new catch phrase.

332
00:11:20,614 --> 00:11:21,846
"Welcome to
Devil Time"?

333
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,281
What the hell does that mean?
        She knows what it means.

334
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:24,649
I have no idea what that means.

335
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:27,152
Oh.
Okay, yeah. I...

336
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:28,820
I was at the dojo this morning.

337
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:30,789
But it's not what you think.

338
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:33,124
I went because of this...

339
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:34,492
WESLEY (on voice mail):
     My life is destroyed.

340
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:36,161
And it all started
       with<i> Body Bags 4.</i>

341
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:37,395
Call me back.

342
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:39,998
What "started with<i> Body Bags 4"?</i>

343
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,299
I have no idea.

344
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:43,068
That's why I went
to go see see Wesley.

345
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,804
But he was already dead and...

346
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:48,139
I panicked and then I ran...

347
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:49,474
But I swear

348
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:50,842
I would've never hurt Wesley.

349
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:54,145
Even though we were divorced,
   I really cared about him.

350
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:55,980
Where were you at 7:00 a.m.
         this morning?

351
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:57,649
With Raphael.

352
00:11:57,651 --> 00:11:58,850
My Pilates instructor.

353
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:01,319
And how does the Weaponizer
            feel about all this?

354
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:03,888
(whispering):
                 Who the hell is
                 the Weaponizer?

355
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,857
He's a character played
       by Kimo Van Zandt,

356
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:07,392
Wesley's co-star

357
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,928
and her current husband.

358
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,363
So you used to be married
       to an action star,

359
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:14,332
only to divorce him
                       and marry

360
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:16,201
another action star?

361
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:18,103
Yeah. It was the '90s.

362
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:19,537
We did a lot of coke.

363
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:21,172
Well, how did
   your current husband feel

364
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:22,507
about you visiting your ex?

365
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:23,541
Oh, that's easy.

366
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:25,210
Kimo and Wesley
               hated each other.

367
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:26,344
Long-standing feud.

368
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:27,879
God only knows
    what Kimo would've done

369
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:29,347
if he knew I went to see him.

370
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:30,849
Where was Kimo this morning?

371
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:34,252
Uh, at ActionCon in Reno.

372
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,620
Signing autographs.

373
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:37,122
WESLEY:
  <i> Where's my money, partner?</i>

374
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:39,624
I will end you!

375
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:41,760
Without<i> Body Bags 4, </i>
     you are nothing, man!

376
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:44,629
How does<i> Body Bags 4 </i>
     figure into all this?

377
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:47,465
Well, Wesley, our victim, uh,

378
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:49,467
was the hero of
    the<i> Body Bags</i> franchise.

379
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:50,568
Ooh, and in<i> Body Bags 4,</i>

380
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:51,970
newcomer Kimo
             Van Zandt appeared.

381
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:53,705
He played this
      shady CIA operative,

382
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:55,039
who acted as Wesley's foil

383
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,541
and his eventual
     ambiguous ally, but...

384
00:12:56,543 --> 00:12:58,476
Then Kimo's character
got spun off into his own,

385
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:01,246
more successful franchise,
        <i> The Weaponizer.</i>

386
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:03,214
Personal fave:
<i>Weaponizer 4: The Last Arsenal.</i>

387
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:05,316
So good, right?
 At the end, with the whole...

388
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:07,252
(both imitate explosion)
Okay, I so regret
asking you guys this.

389
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:10,088
Although, you're oddly adorable.

390
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,390
So, it seems like
Kimo has always

391
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:13,491
had it out for Wesley.

392
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:16,060
Stole his wife,
   stole his film franchise.

393
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:17,896
So maybe he really did "end" it
   for him once and for all.

394
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:19,097
But Kimo was in Reno.

395
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:20,965
At ActionCon.

396
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,601
But that convention
happens the last week in August.

397
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:25,670
How do you know that?
My mom used to go
to it every year.

398
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:27,005
So Jamie's lying.
Or Kimo's lying to her.

399
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:28,740
Either way, we gotta find him.

400
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:30,842
I'll put out a BOLO.
Okay.

401
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:33,845
MOM:
    <i> Please, hold on. Um...</i>

402
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:37,749
Again, I apologize that the
 children were late for school.

403
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:40,118
And, yes, I understand

404
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,755
that pants need
   to be worn every day, now.

405
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,592
(sighs)

406
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:49,594
(whimpers)

407
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:53,431
Ooh!

408
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:55,767
Rough day?

409
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:56,935
Oh...

410
00:13:56,937 --> 00:13:59,304
Since returning to my
employment, I have found

411
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:02,540
the number of daily tasks
  to be almost insurmountable.

412
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:04,776
But hey...

413
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:07,011
at least you're not here
    to take me back to Hell.

414
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:14,118
You are here to take me
         back to Hell?

415
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,154
No, Mom, I'm not.
          I'm just...

416
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:18,489
Listen, I was just wondering
              if your being here

417
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:20,792
is just postponing
                 the inevitable.

418
00:14:20,794 --> 00:14:24,462
I mean, at some point...

419
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:27,332
other siblings will come
   down here looking for you.

420
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:29,300
And I'll convince them
        to let me stay,

421
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:31,002
just like I did you and Lucifer.

422
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:35,206
You were gone
  for a really long time, Mom.

423
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:38,209
You might not know your children
  as well as you think you do.

424
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:41,980
You may be right.

425
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:44,849
But, at least for now,

426
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:46,384
I have you and Lucifer.

427
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,053
My brave boys.

428
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,257
So if I'm here on Earth

429
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:54,759
for two more years...

430
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:57,695
or two hours...

431
00:14:57,697 --> 00:15:00,798
I will take every moment
        that I can get.

432
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:10,141
("Turn It On Again"
by Max Boogie Overdrive playing)

433
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:15,179
¶ Little wine, little gin... ¶

434
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:17,916
CHLOE:
      <i> Yeah, the tip said</i>
   <i> that we'd find Kimo here.</i>

435
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:19,617
<i> I guess we have</i>
      <i> to just sit tight.</i>

436
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:23,187
Where did that
      sandwich come from?

437
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:25,523
The patrol guys give them to us
    when we're on stakeouts.

438
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:26,491
I'm starving.

439
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:29,294
What the hell?

440
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:31,963
What part of "opposite day"
     don't you understand?

441
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:34,365
It was a random car accident.

442
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:35,700
(chuckles)

443
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:37,201
Well, let's agree...
       that you're wrong.

444
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:38,536
What is with you?

445
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:40,672
Why are you suddenly so
  concerned for my well-being?

446
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:43,808
(door opens)

447
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,044
Oh, m...

448
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:47,045
Kimo Van Zandt.

449
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:48,746
In the flesh.
          Here we go.

450
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:50,915
(car lock beeps)

451
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:52,317
What the hell?

452
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,384
(grunts)

453
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:54,252
CHLOE:
                           LAPD!

454
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:55,887
On the ground, now!

455
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:58,890
On the ground.

456
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:00,491
You. Over there.

457
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:03,428
¶ Turn it on... ¶

458
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:06,230
HIPSTER:
                   Dude, no way!

459
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:08,566
The Weaponizer
          just tried to jump me?

460
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:09,567
¶ Turn it on. ¶

461
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:10,702
(hipster laughing)

462
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:19,677
Why did you attack the guy
             in the parking lot?
    I swear, I wasn't going

463
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,512
to hurt him.
              Was he a terrorist

464
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:23,114
about to plant a bomb?

465
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:24,782
Leader of a murderous cult,
            perhaps?

466
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:26,117
He must be someone<i> really</i> evil

467
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:28,252
for the Weaponizer
        to get involved.

468
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:29,787
He's just some guy

469
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:31,589
in trouble with the Mob.

470
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:33,157
So they've got his family

471
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,827
and they're forcing him
     to kill the president.

472
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,795
No. He's got gambling debts.

473
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:39,130
H-Hold on.

474
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:41,666
So you, former A-list,
                   B-list actor,

475
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,668
you're now breaking
               legs for the Mob?

476
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,837
It's to pay the bills.

477
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,805
I'm broke.

478
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:50,308
(chuckling):
         Oh, come now.

479
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,809
Look at me.

480
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:54,312
You're the Weaponizer.

481
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:58,282
What is it your badass-kicking
    self truly desires, hmm?

482
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:01,819
For my wife to be happy.

483
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:04,522
That's why I've been willing
to take any job.

484
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,657
So she won't find out.

485
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:09,994
She's my...

486
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:11,796
lighthouse.

487
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:14,832
What happened to you, man?

488
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:16,501
Your lighthouse?

489
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:18,136
Pathetic.
                      (sighs)

490
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:19,804
Was killing
                    Wesley Cabot

491
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:22,306
another case of leg-breaking
       gone awry or what?

492
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:23,641
No!

493
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:25,009
I-I'd never hurt Wesley.

494
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:26,511
We were friends.
                            Huh.

495
00:17:26,513 --> 00:17:28,179
Could've fooled me.
We had a public rivalry,

496
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:30,515
but-but it was just
         for business.

497
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:33,017
(scoffs)
In reality,
we share everything.

498
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:34,519
The same managers,
       agents, lawyers...

499
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:35,853
Wives?
I'm not proud

500
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:39,690
of how it went down with Jamie,
      but we fell in love.

501
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:41,826
And Wesley forgave me.

502
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:44,362
We even kept our friendship
secret from Jamie

503
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:45,563
so it wouldn't be weird.

504
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,498
Then where were you
      this morning at 7:00 a.m.?

505
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,700
We know it wasn't ActionCon.
I was

506
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:53,371
signing stuff
  at a small comic book store.

507
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:56,340
I lied to Jamie
because I don't want her to know

508
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:57,575
how bad it's gotten.

509
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,243
Detective.

510
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,245
Yeah.

511
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:04,015
You should look
at this.

512
00:18:04,017 --> 00:18:05,416
(sighs)

513
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:08,219
Your prints were
           on the murder weapon.

514
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:09,921
Kimo Van Zandt,
you're under arrest

515
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,756
for the murder
                of Wesley Cabot.

516
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,392
N-No. No!

517
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:16,894
No!

518
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:18,696
¶ ¶

519
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:23,601
LUCIFER:
   <i> I don't think he did it.</i>

520
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,236
Why? 'Cause he's
        the Weaponizer?

521
00:18:25,238 --> 00:18:27,238
The Weaponizer once bit
a man's ear off

522
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,240
for looking at him funny--
this puddle of whine

523
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:31,209
doesn't have it in him anymore.
              He breaks legs

524
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:33,444
for the Mob.
  Yes, but he's not a killer.

525
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,880
All he cares about is
    his well-preserved wife.

526
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:38,049
Maybe he can get a jury
     to buy that. I don't.

527
00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:40,051
And, personally, I'm happy
     the judge set his bail

528
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:41,052
at half a million.

529
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:42,887
Now Dan has time
to check his alibi,

530
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:45,423
and...
      (indistinct chatter)

531
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:47,925
I thought he was broke.

532
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:49,293
Oh, I paid his bail.

533
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,262
Even in this woeful,
                 pathetic state,

534
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:53,264
the Weaponizer does not
       spend one minute in jail.

535
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:54,465
"Not on my watch."

536
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,300
(chuckles) See what
    I did there, with the...

537
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,436
I literally don't know what
    to say to you right now.

538
00:18:58,438 --> 00:18:59,770
(chuckles)
        Mr. Morningstar.

539
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:01,772
Yes.
              Uh, Ryan Goldburg,

540
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:03,941
uh, Kimo's
               business manager.

541
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:06,277
I wanted to thank you
      for making his bail.

542
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:09,580
Uh, you know, Kimo sure as hell
    couldn't pay it himself.
Oh, it's the least

543
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:11,449
I could do
 for a true national treasure.

544
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:12,483
CHLOE:
So, for someone
with so many

545
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:13,684
hit movies under their belt,

546
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:14,952
why is he so broke?

547
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:17,455
Exotic cars. Private islands.

548
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:20,258
You know what costs more
     than an albino tiger?

549
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,160
The upkeep on an albino tiger.

550
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:23,494
He blew through
                      his money.

551
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:24,529
Didn't listen.

552
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:26,464
And now there's no more
           coming in.

553
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:28,799
Thanks again.
              Yes.

554
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:30,468
Such a tragedy.

555
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,670
Well, it's always a tragedy
   when someone gets killed.

556
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,472
No, I'm talking about his tiger.

557
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:36,274
I would have bought it
         if I'd known.

558
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:41,212
Why isn't Dan
checking the alibi?

559
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:42,880
Dan...

560
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,350
(siren wailing in distance)

561
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:54,659
I want to talk about Uriel.

562
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:56,160
Well, what's there
to talk about?

563
00:19:56,162 --> 00:19:58,162
Punch, taunt, punch,
      groin stomp. Repeat.

564
00:19:58,164 --> 00:19:59,997
Yeah, listen, Luci,
             I've been thinking,

565
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:02,833
there might be a better way
to handle this without violence.

566
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:04,468
What, like hugging him
        back to Heaven?

567
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,370
Like hiding Mom.
                   Hiding Chloe.

568
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:07,705
And wait Uriel out.

569
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,840
What?
              Look, just because
             he told us his plan

570
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:11,676
doesn't mean
                that's his plan.

571
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:12,743
It's Uriel.

572
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,346
It could be a trap.

573
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:18,549
Brother,
   you've been here too long.

574
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,351
It's changed you.

575
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:23,654
What do you mean?
Meaning that ever since

576
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:25,556
you've been here,
you've had to restrain yourself.

577
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:28,859
But this is Uriel. You're you.

578
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:31,395
Amenadiel. Firstborn.

579
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,064
Unleash yourself.

580
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:35,066
Enjoy it.

581
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:38,236
(sighs)

582
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:40,871
Look, you do know that
  he was always afraid of you.

583
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:43,407
Don't mock me, Lucifer.
I'm not. It's true.

584
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,276
All right?
Growing up, we...

585
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:47,778
well, we all looked up to you.

586
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,848
You were like our
very own action star.

587
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,717
Even you?

588
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:53,951
Well, don't get
me wrong. You were

589
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:55,720
a major power-hungry
dick about it.

590
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:58,222
But trust me.

591
00:20:58,224 --> 00:21:02,293
Just the sight of you will send
quivers down Uriel's spine.

592
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:06,030
You're right.

593
00:21:06,032 --> 00:21:08,232
All he needs to see is me

594
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:10,034
in<i> all</i> of my glory.

595
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:13,437
And<i> there's</i> that angelic
ego I'm talking about.

596
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,072
Right.

597
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:17,541
You know what to do.

598
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:19,510
¶ ¶

599
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:28,719
AMENADIEL:
Uriel.

600
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:32,957
Amenadiel.

601
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,460
It's good to see you,
        little brother.

602
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:39,930
You're a welcome sight
         for sore eyes.

603
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:42,233
I am?
Of course you are.

604
00:21:42,235 --> 00:21:44,402
(sighs)

605
00:21:44,404 --> 00:21:47,605
But, Uri, you must go home.

606
00:21:47,607 --> 00:21:49,907
I really do have
everything under control.

607
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:51,475
Are you sure?

608
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:55,146
Lucifer's still on Earth.
      Now Mom's here, too.

609
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:57,782
Uh... It almost looks like
   you're in over your head.

610
00:21:57,784 --> 00:22:00,151
But don't worry.

611
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:02,320
I'm here to help.

612
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:05,122
Yeah.

613
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:08,125
You really think
       I need your help?

614
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:09,627
You.

615
00:22:09,629 --> 00:22:12,663
Pathetic,
small Uriel.

616
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:15,633
Not the eldest son.

617
00:22:15,635 --> 00:22:17,468
Not the young rebel.

618
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:20,805
But an angel buried somewhere
      deep in the middle.

619
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:22,940
Lost in the crowd

620
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:24,041
of your betters.
                  That is not...

621
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:26,510
If God wants something done,

622
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:29,780
he sends me, Uri.

623
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:33,484
Me.

624
00:22:33,486 --> 00:22:35,953
Not you.

625
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:38,055
I am Amenadiel.

626
00:22:38,057 --> 00:22:39,490
The fury

627
00:22:39,492 --> 00:22:40,624
and the righteousness
of our father.

628
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:43,994
And you, little brother,
are standing in my way.

629
00:22:43,996 --> 00:22:47,298
Okay. You're right.

630
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,266
I'm sorry.

631
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,536
I'll return home.

632
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:58,976
You know what?
Something's bothering me.

633
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,179
I knew it.

634
00:23:02,181 --> 00:23:04,181
"Fury of God"

635
00:23:04,183 --> 00:23:05,850
doesn't usually talk so much.

636
00:23:05,852 --> 00:23:07,551
More a man of action.

637
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:10,654
Amenadiel, at full strength,
I could never beat this easily.

638
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:12,490
Something's happened to you.

639
00:23:14,527 --> 00:23:16,694
(grunts)
I saw this coming,
you know.

640
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:17,862
I mean, not this exactly,

641
00:23:17,864 --> 00:23:20,097
because patterns
    are never that precise,

642
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:21,332
but your pride

643
00:23:21,334 --> 00:23:23,601
was always gonna
be your undoing.

644
00:23:23,603 --> 00:23:25,403
After all, the
bigger they are...

645
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:29,673
Well, I think even you
   can guess what comes next.

646
00:23:34,714 --> 00:23:37,181
I'm glad you came
      instead of Lucifer.

647
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:41,051
And I've waited so long
           for this.

648
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:43,587
Forgive me if I enjoy it.

649
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,493
¶ ¶

650
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:51,060
So did Kimo's alibi check out?
Uh, yeah.

651
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:53,364
Yeah. According to the owner
of the comic book store,

652
00:23:53,366 --> 00:23:55,032
Kimo was there all morning,
signing merchandise.

653
00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:58,102
So you had to confiscate all
these toys just to tell me that?

654
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:00,971
Uh, yeah. Yeah,
it's a visual aid.

655
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:03,541
Right.
Look, those dolls, they're
selling like hotcakes.

656
00:24:03,543 --> 00:24:05,376
The owner said that
ever since<i> Body Bags</i> started

657
00:24:05,378 --> 00:24:07,211
streaming on Netflix,
he can't keep them in stock.

658
00:24:07,213 --> 00:24:09,213
And that relates
              to the murder how?

659
00:24:09,215 --> 00:24:10,881
Well, at the scene,

660
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:13,884
Wesley was going over all
of his old<i> Body Bags 4</i> stuff.

661
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:15,719
Mm-hmm.
Including his old contract,

662
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:17,221
says he's entitled
to one percent

663
00:24:17,223 --> 00:24:18,956
of all merchandising
revenue. It's not much.

664
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:21,725
So I had the studio send over
a copy of<i> their</i> contract.
                         Mm-hmm.

665
00:24:21,727 --> 00:24:23,093
Look at that.

666
00:24:23,095 --> 00:24:24,995
Says Wesley should be
getting ten percent.

667
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:27,565
Yeah. I also took a look at
Kimo Van Zandt's contract.

668
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:29,400
Same thing happened to him.

669
00:24:29,402 --> 00:24:31,735
Kimo and Wesley shared
everything. Wives, agents...

670
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:32,837
business managers.

671
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:34,505
Ryan Goldburg.
         Ryan Goldburg.

672
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:36,340
Wesley figured out Ryan's
           scam, confronted him,

673
00:24:36,342 --> 00:24:38,342
and then Ryan killed him
              to keep him quiet.

674
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:39,910
Yeah. But how did
he get Kimo's prints

675
00:24:39,912 --> 00:24:41,912
on the murder weapon so
that he could frame him?

676
00:24:41,914 --> 00:24:42,913
I'm gonna ask him.

677
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:44,148
All right. You coming?

678
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,683
No, no. You got this covered.

679
00:24:45,685 --> 00:24:47,284
What? You've been
attached to me all day

680
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:49,286
and now that we may have
figured out who killed Wesley,

681
00:24:49,288 --> 00:24:51,789
you're just leaving?
   Yes. Well, by now, the threat
        to you should've passed.

682
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:54,191
But just in case, I've some
   family business to attend to.

683
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:55,192
All right?

684
00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:57,194
Fine. I'll go alone.

685
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:03,601
It's like,
   get a room already, right?

686
00:25:03,603 --> 00:25:04,835
What?

687
00:25:05,872 --> 00:25:07,271
Too soon?

688
00:25:07,273 --> 00:25:09,940
Sorry.

689
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:12,209
So, um... how-how's
          the... the case going?

690
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:13,444
It's fine.

691
00:25:13,446 --> 00:25:15,713
Yeah, it looks like
   the money manager did it.

692
00:25:15,715 --> 00:25:17,815
Tried to frame Kimo Van Zandt.

693
00:25:17,817 --> 00:25:19,149
Don't know how yet.

694
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:22,186
Man, killed by your
                own weird award.

695
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:24,054
That's gotta suck.

696
00:25:24,056 --> 00:25:26,056
It was actually...
           (chuckles)

697
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:28,392
It was really, really touching
       when they got it.

698
00:25:29,962 --> 00:25:32,129
When<i> they</i> got it.

699
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:33,998
<i> There were two awards.</i>

700
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,833
Thanks. What are
              you talking about?

701
00:25:35,835 --> 00:25:37,034
There were two awards,

702
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:38,402
because a fight
takes two people.

703
00:25:38,404 --> 00:25:40,137
One of the awards
     was given to Wesley...

704
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:41,805
And one to Kimo.
                 Someone must've

705
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:43,007
switched out his
             award for Wesley's.

706
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:44,742
That's why Kimo's
              prints were on it.

707
00:25:44,744 --> 00:25:45,809
Jamie Lee Adrienne
was at the dojo.

708
00:25:45,811 --> 00:25:47,478
Maybe she had access
to Kimo's award.

709
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,746
Maybe she's working with Ryan.

710
00:25:48,748 --> 00:25:49,914
Okay, you find Jamie,
     (elevator bell dings)

711
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:51,348
I'll get the business manager.
        His office said

712
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,284
he's having lunch at
the Ignacia Hotel.

713
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:58,689
Ah! Right, let me just
               make myself comfy

714
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:01,191
because I cannot wait

715
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:03,827
to hear how you sent
        Urinal packing.

716
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:06,664
(chuckles)
 And please do not skimp on any

717
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:08,399
of the gory details.

718
00:26:11,504 --> 00:26:13,170
MAZE: This would
never have happened

719
00:26:13,172 --> 00:26:15,239
if you'd listened
to me earlier.

720
00:26:17,777 --> 00:26:21,078
(scoffs)
 How is this possible, brother?

721
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:26,517
I no longer have my powers.

722
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:28,919
Well, what happened to them?
Oh, I don't know, Luci,

723
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:30,187
pick a sin.

724
00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:32,523
Is it because I released
    a damned soul from Hell?

725
00:26:32,525 --> 00:26:35,359
Slept with a demon? Is it
 because I'm working with you?

726
00:26:35,361 --> 00:26:37,094
Or because of Mom?

727
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:42,266
Or am I simply no longer worthy?

728
00:26:43,636 --> 00:26:45,035
(sniffles)

729
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:48,005
It's time that I faced
the truth, brother.

730
00:26:50,076 --> 00:26:52,776
I've fallen.

731
00:26:57,717 --> 00:26:58,949
Well.

732
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:01,218
Welcome to the club.
       Meetings are on Tuesdays.

733
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,420
It's different
for me, Luci.

734
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:04,955
It's different.

735
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:07,324
I no longer have my powers.

736
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:08,792
My very strength...

737
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,260
Big deal!

738
00:27:10,262 --> 00:27:13,230
It's probably the best thing
   that ever happened to you.

739
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:16,166
But right now I haven't
     got time to hold your hand,

740
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:18,569
because I need to
             clear up your mess!

741
00:27:18,571 --> 00:27:20,738
My mess?
                   Uriel's still
                      out there.

742
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,272
And the clock is up--

743
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:24,808
which means the detective
             is in grave danger.

744
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:33,183
¶ It's a state of mind ¶

745
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:35,085
¶ It's a state of grace ¶

746
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:37,254
¶ Close your eyes ¶

747
00:27:37,256 --> 00:27:38,856
¶ Drift away ¶

748
00:27:38,858 --> 00:27:40,958
¶ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ¶

749
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,228
¶ Everybody needs a little ¶

750
00:27:45,431 --> 00:27:47,164
¶ California ¶

751
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:50,034
¶ I can be your California ¶

752
00:27:50,036 --> 00:27:51,535
(horn honking)

753
00:27:51,537 --> 00:27:53,270
Are you serious?

754
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:57,107
What? You wear the orange vest,
 you can do whatever you want?!

755
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:58,475
¶ ¶

756
00:27:58,477 --> 00:28:02,279
¶ You can visit
     but you cannot stay ¶

757
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:05,883
¶ Well, I could be
     your California baby ¶

758
00:28:05,885 --> 00:28:09,953
¶ And we could be
      a flawed paradise ¶

759
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:13,957
¶ Nothing perfect
        lasts forever ¶

760
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:16,794
¶ But, baby,
    wouldn't that be nice ¶

761
00:28:16,796 --> 00:28:17,961
¶ Ah, ah, ah ¶

762
00:28:17,963 --> 00:28:19,129
¶ Ooh ¶

763
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:21,031
¶ Ooh, ooh ¶

764
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:23,200
¶ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ¶

765
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:24,702
¶ Ooh, ooh, ooh. ¶

766
00:28:28,007 --> 00:28:30,641
(barking)
WOMAN: Stop it!
Why are you barking now?

767
00:28:30,643 --> 00:28:31,975
What is wrong with you?

768
00:28:31,977 --> 00:28:34,311
(continues barking)
       Oh! I am your mother!

769
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:37,481
Sort of.
                    Did you make
                     one of them

770
00:28:37,483 --> 00:28:38,749
your pet?

771
00:28:38,751 --> 00:28:40,484
I figured out
the husband,

772
00:28:40,486 --> 00:28:41,985
then it was the job,

773
00:28:41,987 --> 00:28:43,754
now it's the children.

774
00:28:43,756 --> 00:28:45,756
(exhales): This is supposed
to be a time out

775
00:28:45,758 --> 00:28:48,258
(barking continues)
to teach you a lesson!

776
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,661
I don't think that's
             how time outs work.

777
00:28:50,663 --> 00:28:53,030
(barking)

778
00:28:53,032 --> 00:28:54,765
(deep growl)

779
00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:56,467
Mommy, I'm sorry.

780
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:02,272
Maybe you're not
               so bad after all.

781
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:02,840
We need to talk.

782
00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:08,946
¶ Baby, please believe me ¶

783
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,282
¶ I can't be tempted ¶

784
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:15,052
¶ No more ¶

785
00:29:15,054 --> 00:29:16,520
¶ I got it out of ¶

786
00:29:16,522 --> 00:29:18,489
¶ The system... ¶
                    What?

787
00:29:19,792 --> 00:29:20,924
Detective Decker.

788
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:22,359
What are you doing here?

789
00:29:22,361 --> 00:29:24,194
I could ask you two
        the same thing.

790
00:29:24,196 --> 00:29:26,029
Uh, we're just having
             a business meeting.

791
00:29:26,031 --> 00:29:27,197
Yeah.
Mm.

792
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,699
You make out
     with all your clients?

793
00:29:28,701 --> 00:29:30,367
What's the occasion?
You celebrating

794
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:33,470
the successful theft of Wesley
and Kimo's merchandising money?

795
00:29:33,472 --> 00:29:36,039
I would never steal
        from my clients.

796
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:38,542
Oh, you are clever, Ryan.

797
00:29:38,544 --> 00:29:40,644
What is she talking
about, Ryan?
What I'm talking about

798
00:29:40,646 --> 00:29:42,045
is how Wesley realized

799
00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:44,414
his action figures
  were selling like hotcakes,

800
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:46,116
did some investigating,

801
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:47,918
and saw that
     he was getting robbed.

802
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,720
I think you should go.
Unfortunately
for Wesley,

803
00:29:49,722 --> 00:29:52,055
he shared his concerns
   about his business manager

804
00:29:52,057 --> 00:29:54,992
with his ex-wife, who happened
    to be sleeping with him.

805
00:29:54,994 --> 00:29:56,994
And that voice mail
that you played for us,

806
00:29:56,996 --> 00:29:59,196
that's what started this,
and that's what got him killed.

807
00:30:01,767 --> 00:30:02,933
He did it!

808
00:30:02,935 --> 00:30:04,067
He's the one

809
00:30:04,069 --> 00:30:05,502
who killed Wesley!
                       What?!

810
00:30:05,504 --> 00:30:06,804
No, it was her idea!

811
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:08,739
It was her idea to switch out
      the Nunchuck Award,

812
00:30:08,741 --> 00:30:09,740
cover it in blood...

813
00:30:09,742 --> 00:30:10,574
Don't shoot!

814
00:30:10,576 --> 00:30:12,409
KIMO:
You stole from me,

815
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:13,577
killed Wesley,

816
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:16,280
then you tried
      to frame me for it?!

817
00:30:16,282 --> 00:30:19,750
Kimo...
I cared about
both of you!

818
00:30:19,752 --> 00:30:20,951
(screams)
                     No, please!

819
00:30:20,953 --> 00:30:22,119
Kimo...

820
00:30:22,121 --> 00:30:23,787
put the gun down. Please.

821
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:25,756
They murdered Wesley.

822
00:30:25,758 --> 00:30:28,592
And they will pay for that,
         I promise you.

823
00:30:28,594 --> 00:30:31,762
But don't let them ruin
 your life, too, Kimo. Please.

824
00:30:31,764 --> 00:30:33,030
My life is already ruined.

825
00:30:33,032 --> 00:30:34,264
Get out of the way.

826
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:35,299
No.
I'll shoot you!

827
00:30:35,301 --> 00:30:36,600
I don't care anymore!

828
00:30:36,602 --> 00:30:37,801
LUCIFER:
             Kimo!

829
00:30:37,803 --> 00:30:40,037
CHLOE: Lucifer,
                      stay back.

830
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:41,271
Guys, stand down.

831
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:43,273
Detective, you don't know
    what you're up against.

832
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:45,542
This was engineered
   to put you in harm's way.

833
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:47,444
You must believe me.

834
00:30:47,446 --> 00:30:48,612
Lucifer,

835
00:30:48,614 --> 00:30:51,615
I know exactly
      what I'm up against.

836
00:30:51,617 --> 00:30:53,350
It's just a man...

837
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:55,352
who's in a lot of pain.

838
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:02,392
Kimo, a couple
                        days ago

839
00:31:02,394 --> 00:31:05,362
I was in a really bad
         car accident.

840
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:07,798
And I've spent the last few days

841
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,167
trying to convince everybody
             that cares about me

842
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:12,135
that it wasn't
                     a big deal.

843
00:31:12,137 --> 00:31:14,171
The truth is...

844
00:31:14,173 --> 00:31:16,640
I'm terrified.

845
00:31:16,642 --> 00:31:19,877
I'm scared of how
     it can all just end...

846
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:21,411
with no rhyme or reason.

847
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:23,680
And what I want
                 to do right now

848
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:25,749
is just go home

849
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:27,985
and read a bedtime story
        to my daughter.

850
00:31:27,987 --> 00:31:32,089
But... you know...
  that's not up to me, either.

851
00:31:32,091 --> 00:31:35,425
We can't control
      what happens to us,

852
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:38,795
only how it affects us
    and the choices we make.

853
00:31:39,865 --> 00:31:42,032
So, please.

854
00:31:42,034 --> 00:31:45,369
Make the right choice, Kimo.

855
00:31:45,371 --> 00:31:47,304
Please put down the gun.

856
00:31:56,015 --> 00:31:57,981
(sirens wailing)

857
00:31:59,285 --> 00:32:00,350
(exhales)

858
00:32:00,352 --> 00:32:02,953
(whispering):
           Thank you.

859
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:07,691
Well, well done, Detective.

860
00:32:07,693 --> 00:32:09,459
Kimo was about to do
a very bad thing.

861
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:11,561
Oh, well, not on my watch.

862
00:32:11,563 --> 00:32:14,698
(chuckles) Very good.

863
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,633
Let me escort you back
        to the station.

864
00:32:16,635 --> 00:32:19,536
No... I'm-I'm okay.

865
00:32:19,538 --> 00:32:22,472
You know, I don't
                believe in fate.

866
00:32:22,474 --> 00:32:25,075
And I don't believe in bad luck.

867
00:32:25,077 --> 00:32:29,246
And I appreciate your concern,
       but come what may.

868
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:32,249
I am leaving here... alone.

869
00:32:32,251 --> 00:32:34,885
Very well.

870
00:32:34,887 --> 00:32:38,255
But just... buckle up,
       Detective, please.

871
00:32:38,257 --> 00:32:39,723
(sighs)

872
00:32:39,725 --> 00:32:41,491
Right. Now, if
you'll excuse me.

873
00:32:41,493 --> 00:32:44,895
There's something
      I need to deal with.

874
00:32:44,897 --> 00:32:46,997
¶ Don't you feel ¶

875
00:32:46,999 --> 00:32:50,200
¶ How I call your name ¶

876
00:32:52,237 --> 00:32:56,073
¶ Calm you with my hand ¶

877
00:32:56,075 --> 00:33:00,077
¶ While you're in the shade ¶

878
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:02,145
¶ I can't move. ¶

879
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:03,280
Lucifer.

880
00:33:03,282 --> 00:33:05,415
Mum.

881
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:08,018
I'm letting Uriel
     take me back to Hell.

882
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,286
(scoffs)

883
00:33:09,288 --> 00:33:11,855
Well, there's no need
     to overreact, Mother.

884
00:33:11,857 --> 00:33:13,757
MAZE:
                     Let her go.

885
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:15,993
It's the right move.

886
00:33:15,995 --> 00:33:17,661
Right. Of course.

887
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:19,029
Remind me at some point
to give you a refresher

888
00:33:19,031 --> 00:33:20,364
on the meaning of loyalty.

889
00:33:20,366 --> 00:33:22,966
MAZE:
                It's what's best
                   for everyone.

890
00:33:22,968 --> 00:33:26,336
She goes back to Hell,
       where she belongs;

891
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:27,971
Chloe is safe,

892
00:33:27,973 --> 00:33:31,208
and I don't have to clean up
       your mess anymore.

893
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:35,379
More importantly,
   you get to keep your word.

894
00:33:35,381 --> 00:33:36,780
I am keeping my word.

895
00:33:36,782 --> 00:33:39,383
You're serving out your sentence
         here on Earth.

896
00:33:39,385 --> 00:33:40,884
You know that's not
    what your Father wanted.

897
00:33:40,886 --> 00:33:42,219
Do I?!

898
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:45,322
Everyone thinks
    they know what He wants.

899
00:33:45,324 --> 00:33:48,892
Amenadiel did when he first
   got here, now Uriel does.

900
00:33:48,894 --> 00:33:51,661
Human wars have been waged
         because of it.

901
00:33:51,663 --> 00:33:53,797
Dad showed me

902
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:55,799
an open door.

903
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:57,834
Does that mean I was meant
    to take you back to Hell

904
00:33:57,836 --> 00:34:00,470
or was he insinuating
 that Hell was getting drafty?

905
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:01,805
Nobody bloody knows,

906
00:34:01,807 --> 00:34:04,808
because the selfish bastard
      won't just tell us!

907
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:07,878
And I'm sick of it.

908
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,413
No more.

909
00:34:10,482 --> 00:34:12,482
No more.

910
00:34:12,484 --> 00:34:15,986
There's my Lightbringer.

911
00:34:15,988 --> 00:34:17,954
My Morningstar.

912
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:24,027
Uriel was so small
            when he was a child.

913
00:34:24,029 --> 00:34:27,364
All he ever wanted was to play
    with you and the older kids.

914
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:29,032
But you all excluded him.

915
00:34:29,034 --> 00:34:30,233
Yes.

916
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:32,335
And every time he came back,

917
00:34:32,337 --> 00:34:34,271
pestering us again.

918
00:34:34,273 --> 00:34:36,206
Which is strange,

919
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:38,341
considering he knew
   what the outcome would be.

920
00:34:38,343 --> 00:34:42,112
That's how much he wanted
      to be around you, Lucifer.

921
00:34:42,114 --> 00:34:44,915
Uriel is a
                   stubborn boy.

922
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:46,683
When he sets his mind,

923
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:49,352
it doesn't waver.

924
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:51,721
He's not going to
            give up until he has

925
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:53,723
either me or
                 that detective.

926
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:55,525
Mum...

927
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:58,095
I refuse to believe that.

928
00:34:58,097 --> 00:35:00,730
There is always another way.

929
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:03,700
If anyone can find it,

930
00:35:03,702 --> 00:35:04,935
it's you.

931
00:35:06,238 --> 00:35:08,238
¶ 2,000 years I've ¶

932
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,007
¶ Been in that water ¶

933
00:35:13,712 --> 00:35:16,713
¶ 2,000 years ¶

934
00:35:16,715 --> 00:35:19,683
¶ Sunk like a stone ¶

935
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,654
¶ Desperately reaching
           for nets ¶

936
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:27,891
¶ That the fishermen
         have thrown ¶

937
00:35:30,062 --> 00:35:31,728
¶ I'm trying to find ¶

938
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:34,464
¶ A little bit of hope ¶

939
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:39,402
For a brief moment,

940
00:35:39,404 --> 00:35:43,140
the pattern faltered.

941
00:35:43,142 --> 00:35:45,742
I thought it meant
   you'd actually bring Mom.

942
00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:48,512
That somehow, you'd surprise me.
  'Cause for once in my life,

943
00:35:48,514 --> 00:35:50,580
I'd like to be surprised,
            but no.

944
00:35:50,582 --> 00:35:53,216
No, here you are.

945
00:35:57,589 --> 00:36:00,690
Are you done hiding behind
    our big brother's skirt?

946
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:02,259
(short chuckle)

947
00:36:02,261 --> 00:36:03,960
Yes, it's just me now.

948
00:36:03,962 --> 00:36:06,229
Big, bad Lucifer.

949
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:14,104
We've already had this fight
before, Lucifer.

950
00:36:14,106 --> 00:36:15,639
Right here.

951
00:36:15,641 --> 00:36:17,340
You see, in my head,

952
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:19,543
I've seen everything you do.

953
00:36:19,545 --> 00:36:21,278
I've heard every
   dumb quip you have to say.

954
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,546
Right, let
                      me guess--

955
00:36:22,548 --> 00:36:24,281
in your version,
     I deliver Mom to you,

956
00:36:24,283 --> 00:36:27,617
apologizing, tears
    streaming down my face.

957
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:29,286
Actually, no.
         In my version,

958
00:36:29,288 --> 00:36:30,987
you refuse to give Mom up

959
00:36:30,989 --> 00:36:33,390
and your human friend dies.

960
00:36:33,392 --> 00:36:34,891
Yes, you've tried that
           twice now.

961
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:36,193
Not much luck.

962
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:38,461
Maybe you're not as good
    at this as you thought.

963
00:36:38,463 --> 00:36:40,430
Maybe I'm building up
        to a big finale.

964
00:36:42,134 --> 00:36:44,134
All right.

965
00:36:44,136 --> 00:36:46,203
Uriel...

966
00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:48,805
you don't know what Dad wants.

967
00:36:48,807 --> 00:36:50,640
None of us do.

968
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:52,976
So I think...
You're right.

969
00:36:52,978 --> 00:36:55,812
I don't know what Dad wants.
         None of us do.

970
00:36:55,814 --> 00:36:58,081
Right.

971
00:36:58,083 --> 00:37:00,250
Great, well, I'm glad
       we had this talk.

972
00:37:00,252 --> 00:37:02,485
I'll see you at the next
        family reunion.

973
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:03,820
I'll buy the first round.

974
00:37:03,822 --> 00:37:05,789
But I do know
what he needs.

975
00:37:07,593 --> 00:37:09,492
Mom's out.
   It's only a matter of time

976
00:37:09,494 --> 00:37:11,228
before she
 finds her way back to Heaven,

977
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,996
and then he'll forgive her.

978
00:37:12,998 --> 00:37:15,498
He would never do that.
Why not?
You did.

979
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,667
She's been here, like,
     what-- three minutes?

980
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:19,069
Now you're already
         defending her.

981
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:21,071
Dad'll do the same thing.

982
00:37:21,073 --> 00:37:22,906
He'll let His guard down.

983
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:24,908
And then she'll destroy Him.

984
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:30,113
I need to make sure
      that doesn't happen.

985
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:33,583
That's Azrael's Blade.

986
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:35,185
How do you have it?

987
00:37:35,187 --> 00:37:36,853
I borrowed it
off the Angel of Death

988
00:37:36,855 --> 00:37:38,221
when she wasn't looking.

989
00:37:38,223 --> 00:37:40,690
You're not planning on
        taking Mom back to Hell.

990
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:43,693
That weapon will wipe her
   out of existence entirely.

991
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:45,495
No Heaven, no Hell, just...

992
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:48,365
just gone.

993
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:50,200
Finally, a moment
     of clarity between us.

994
00:37:50,202 --> 00:37:52,936
You've gone completely
                insane, brother.

995
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:54,871
I'm doing
what has to be done,

996
00:37:54,873 --> 00:37:56,473
and you've run out of time.

997
00:37:56,475 --> 00:37:59,042
See, I don't care
   about your deal with Dad.

998
00:37:59,044 --> 00:38:01,411
I don't care about what happens
     to your little human.

999
00:38:01,413 --> 00:38:03,213
But it's obvious
        you care for her

1000
00:38:03,215 --> 00:38:05,715
a tad more than you do Mom.

1001
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:08,718
Now, all I need to do

1002
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,755
is hit this
   one little key right here.

1003
00:38:11,757 --> 00:38:14,824
A sequence will begin,
and two days from now...

1004
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:17,560
your cute little human
will finally die.

1005
00:38:17,562 --> 00:38:21,264
So, Lucifer,

1006
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:23,733
you can either let that happen

1007
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:25,602
or you can give me Mom.

1008
00:38:25,604 --> 00:38:27,570
Last chance.

1009
00:38:29,241 --> 00:38:31,207
You choose.

1010
00:38:33,312 --> 00:38:34,544
Very well.

1011
00:38:37,749 --> 00:38:40,950
Well, you didn't see
     <i> that</i> coming, did you?

1012
00:38:40,952 --> 00:38:42,252
Eh?

1013
00:38:44,456 --> 00:38:47,190
Actually, I did
                  see it coming.

1014
00:38:47,192 --> 00:38:49,559
(grunting)

1015
00:38:52,431 --> 00:38:55,598
I mean, I knew
you were gonna attack.

1016
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,367
I just wasn't sure how.

1017
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:06,276
Patterns are tricky like that.

1018
00:39:06,278 --> 00:39:08,411
Takes time to get
     a real sense of them.

1019
00:39:10,882 --> 00:39:12,515
I needed to study you a bit.

1020
00:39:15,153 --> 00:39:17,387
Took much less time
        than I expected.

1021
00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:20,023
Aah!

1022
00:39:39,144 --> 00:39:40,877
You're lucky I'd never

1023
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:43,246
use Azrael's Blade
        on you, brother.

1024
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:50,153
Why don't you pick on a girl?

1025
00:39:50,155 --> 00:39:51,421
But I have no qualms

1026
00:39:51,423 --> 00:39:54,591
about using it on a filthy,
      scum-sucking demon.

1027
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,244
You haven't
    disappointed, Mazikeen.

1028
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:16,246
Your patterns
       were tough to see.

1029
00:40:20,252 --> 00:40:21,251
Aah!

1030
00:40:24,022 --> 00:40:26,990
But still predictable
          nonetheless.

1031
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:41,404
Because you made it
         so difficult,

1032
00:40:41,406 --> 00:40:44,841
now I'm gonna take out Mom
      <i> and</i> the detective.

1033
00:40:46,244 --> 00:40:47,710
You can't stop me, brother.

1034
00:40:54,386 --> 00:40:56,152
I didn't see that coming.

1035
00:41:00,759 --> 00:41:02,725
(whispers)

1036
00:41:09,401 --> 00:41:11,634
What did he say?

1037
00:41:13,405 --> 00:41:16,139
I... I couldn't understand.

1038
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:18,641
Prick got what
                    he deserved.

1039
00:41:23,949 --> 00:41:25,915
He was my brother.

1040
00:41:33,425 --> 00:41:36,426
¶ When, when, when ¶

1041
00:41:36,428 --> 00:41:39,229
¶ Will we meet ¶

1042
00:41:40,932 --> 00:41:43,433
¶ When I'm outside the station ¶

1043
00:41:43,435 --> 00:41:45,435
CHLOE:
 <i> "As the first stars came out,</i>

1044
00:41:45,437 --> 00:41:48,004
"Coraline finally allowed
    herself to drift into sleep.

1045
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:50,773
"while the gentle upstairs
       music of the mouse circus

1046
00:41:50,775 --> 00:41:53,109
"spilled out onto
           the warm evening air,

1047
00:41:53,111 --> 00:41:57,080
telling the world that
    the summer was almost done."

1048
00:41:58,116 --> 00:41:59,983
Read it again.

1049
00:41:59,985 --> 00:42:02,519
You want me to read it again?

1050
00:42:02,521 --> 00:42:04,954
Okay, baby.

1051
00:42:04,956 --> 00:42:06,623
"Coraline discovered the door

1052
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:08,958
"a little while after they
         moved into the house...

1053
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,927
¶ Will I run ¶

1054
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:19,736
What happened?

1055
00:42:19,738 --> 00:42:22,739
¶ The branches from the tree ¶

1056
00:42:25,176 --> 00:42:28,311
¶ For me, for me ¶

1057
00:42:28,313 --> 00:42:31,247
¶ For me ¶

1058
00:42:31,249 --> 00:42:32,916
Where's Uriel?

1059
00:42:32,918 --> 00:42:35,919
¶ The old life is over ¶

1060
00:42:39,658 --> 00:42:41,824
Oh...

1061
00:42:41,826 --> 00:42:43,459
(gasps)

1062
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:47,196
What have I done?

1063
00:42:47,198 --> 00:42:49,699
No... No, no, no.

1064
00:42:49,701 --> 00:42:53,102
¶ When, when, when ¶

1065
00:42:53,104 --> 00:42:56,773
¶ Will we meet ¶

1066
00:42:56,775 --> 00:43:00,176
¶ Will you turn round
         and face me ¶

1067
00:43:01,346 --> 00:43:03,913
¶ The old life is over ¶

1068
00:43:09,387 --> 00:43:11,988
¶ The old life is over. ¶
