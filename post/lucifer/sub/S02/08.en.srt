00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:04,101
<i> Previously on</i> Lucifer...
I don't care much for my dad.

2
00:00:04,105 --> 00:00:06,835
But you clearly...
care about yours.

3
00:00:06,841 --> 00:00:09,211
I think he would
be proud of you.

4
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:11,844
LUCIFER: Uriel,
that's Azrael's blade.

5
00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:14,006
You're not planning on
taking Mum back to Hell.

6
00:00:14,015 --> 00:00:16,215
That weapon will wipe her
out of existence entirely.

7
00:00:16,217 --> 00:00:18,117
No Heaven, no Hell, just...

8
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:19,279
gone.

9
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:21,116
Why do you feel guilty?

10
00:00:21,122 --> 00:00:23,222
LUCIFER:
<i> Uriel didn't just die.</i>

11
00:00:23,224 --> 00:00:24,524
I killed him.

12
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:26,385
I need you to be honest with me

13
00:00:26,394 --> 00:00:28,034
about who you are.

14
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:29,129
No more lies.

15
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,200
Very well.

16
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:35,901
This is where Lucifer buried
your brother.

17
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:37,203
Why did he do this?

18
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,044
Lucifer was just trying...
No, Mom.

19
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,140
Not Lucifer. Father.

20
00:00:41,142 --> 00:00:42,212
If he wanted to,
he could have

21
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:44,209
prevented all of this
from happening.

22
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:47,581
I'm done trying to please
someone who isn't even here.

Aah! Get off me!

Help...!

MAN: Stop! Stop!

Wait. It's you?

You're kidding me, right?

34
00:01:37,098 --> 00:01:38,758
We can totally work this out.

00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:40,366

00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:43,297

00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:53,084
¶ You got me feeling like. ¶

40
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,610
And so there we were,
the detective and I,

41
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:58,246
standing in her kitchen, and...

42
00:01:58,252 --> 00:02:00,622
she made me...

43
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,621
a sandwich.

44
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,293
(chuckles softly)

45
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,960
I believe this is the part
where you tell me

46
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:11,663
it's much more
than just a sandwich.

47
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:15,304
For example...

48
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,472
maybe it was
a gesture of intimacy.

49
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,141
You know, the slices of bread
representing, perhaps,

50
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:21,641
the detective's trust.

51
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:25,242
Or... was it
a mistrustful sandwich?

52
00:02:25,246 --> 00:02:26,276
I...

53
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,110
Doctor, please,

54
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:30,545
what delicious message
was she sending me?

55
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,245
What about Hitler?

56
00:02:33,254 --> 00:02:35,454
The sandwich is Hitler?

57
00:02:35,456 --> 00:02:38,986
How did you actually
torture Hitler in Hell?

58
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:41,263
Uh...
I mean, is his cell
next to Idi Amin's?

59
00:02:41,262 --> 00:02:42,492
Or Mussolini's?

60
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,656
Or is there kind of a-a-a...

61
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:47,025
a tyrant wing in Hell?

62
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:48,374
Right.
(chuckles)

63
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:51,269
I suppose it was futile of me
to think that you wouldn't want

64
00:02:51,272 --> 00:02:54,272
to discuss the whole...
"I'm really the Devil" thing.

65
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:56,535
The actual Devil?

66
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:57,684
(sighs)

67
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,648
Look, I have to say...

68
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:01,677
I was worried
I'd never see you again.

69
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,152
I thought I'd...

70
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,020
scared you off for good.
Yes,

71
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:07,149
well, Maze, of all people...

72
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:09,494
well, of all...

73
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,320
demons...

74
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:13,525
gave me some needed clarity.

75
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,157
Did she, now?

76
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:17,162
Yes.
Right. Well,

77
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:19,034
speaking of clarity,
do you mind if we return

78
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:20,333
to my current emotional growth?

79
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:21,704
Oh. Yes.

80
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,172
Sorry.

81
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,370
Apology accepted.

82
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:25,701
So, um...

83
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:28,606
what do you think it means?

84
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,313
What about my Uncle Edwin?

85
00:03:31,312 --> 00:03:33,412
Is he down there?
I mean, 'cause he was...

86
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:34,554
(chuckling)
you know....

87
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:37,378
one... he was one bad mama jama.

88
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,854
LUCIFER:<i> I think</i>
<i> I've broken my therapist.</i>

89
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:42,093
And now she's somewhere
to the left of totally useless

90
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:44,059
and to the right
of babbling lunatic.

91
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:46,058
Oh, so she's you
in a skirt.

92
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,990
Very funny. This is
serious, Detective.

93
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:49,895
I'm actually
a bit worried for her.

94
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,497
Hmm, I'm sure
she'll be fine,

95
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:53,668
but if you need anyone
to talk to, I'm here.

96
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:55,767
This is actually something
I can't discuss with you.

97
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:57,399
What? I'm sure
I can handle it.

98
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,844
I've seen all your
ugly parts by now.

99
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,369
Not even close,
I'm afraid.

100
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:02,014
Saved by the Douche.

101
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:04,239
Our victim's name
is Maddie Howard.

102
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:06,405
She was attacked when
she left her apartment.

103
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,953
The assailant chased
her down the alley

104
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:09,408
and stabbed her
repeatedly.

105
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,076
19 times, to be exact.

106
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:14,015
CHLOE: Overkill is usually a
crime of passion-- they probably

107
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:15,021
knew each other.

108
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:16,262
She was killed
in broad daylight?

109
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:17,417
There must have been witnesses.
Yeah,

110
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,024
a bunch,
but depending on who you ask,

111
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:20,756
the killer was a male
who's either Hispanic,

112
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:23,261
Caucasian or black, short
or tall, brown or blond hair,

113
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:24,934
or completely bald.

114
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,932
So we're dealing
with a shapeshifter.

115
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:29,274
Well, eyewitness testimonies
can be unreliable.

116
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,440
Yeah, people's<i> ojos </i>
go a little<i> loco.</i>

117
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:34,308
Evidence, however,
does not lie.

118
00:04:34,308 --> 00:04:37,138
We got substantial bruising
to the skin,

119
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:40,314
blade penetrated not only
soft tissue but also bone.

120
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:42,454
So the killer was
big and strong.

121
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,449
Also, blond head hair,
so odds are really good

122
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:48,152
we're looking for a white guy.
DAN: Hey, guys.

123
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:50,315
Got something over here. Tourist
caught the beginning moments

124
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:51,964
of the attack
in the background of a photo.

125
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,289
CHLOE: Did you get
a look at the killer?

126
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:55,464
No, but look at this-- we got
a good look at the weapon.

127
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:58,962
Pretty insane.
Looks like a movie
prop or something.

128
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:00,066
Can't be.

129
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:01,327
What do you mean,
"Can't be"?

130
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:04,065
A movie prop. Those things
are rubber, aren't they?

131
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:05,341
What?

132
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:07,169
I have to go.

133
00:05:10,077 --> 00:05:11,507
¶ ¶

134
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,923
I don't really have time
for a hike, Lucifer.

135
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:21,819
Bounty business
is booming, okay?

136
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,162
So this better
be important.

137
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:24,387
It is.

138
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,330
Is this...?

139
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:34,472
Where Lucifer
buried Uriel. Yeah.

140
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:36,538
(birds chirping)

141
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:38,097
Okay.

142
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:42,065
So if you two want to cry
it out, I'll be in the car.

143
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,841
What's happened, Lucifer?

144
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,376
Well, someone dug up the grave.
Yeah,

145
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:48,851
I can see that.

146
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,019
But why?

147
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:53,118
Uriel's body is still there.
Yes,

148
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,220
but Azrael's blade isn't.

149
00:05:58,058 --> 00:05:59,358
(sighs)

150
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,890
I believe the weapon
of the Angel of Death

151
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:04,395
is in human hands.

152
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,602
¶ ¶

153
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:19,212
So let me get this straight:
in human hands, Azrael's blade

154
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:20,383
<i> wants</i> to kill?

155
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:22,381
It demands to
be used to...

156
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:24,383
to fulfill its purpose.
Humans are more...

157
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:27,385
malleable than we are,
so it whispers in their ears,

158
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:30,258
beckons to be held-- it takes
any reason someone might want

159
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:32,257
to hurt another and...
Amplifies it

160
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:34,159
a thousandfold.
CHLOE: So if someone

161
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:35,231
leaves the toilet seat up...

162
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:37,059
Trip to stabby town, yes.

163
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:39,234
(soft chuckle)
That's one angry-ass knife.

164
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:40,333
LUCIFER:
Yes, well,

165
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:42,574
it was stolen from
the Angel of Death.

166
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,899
Sis is no sweet peach, is she?

167
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,065
Listen, we're wasting time here.

168
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,173
We need to find the blade.

169
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:48,514
Why?

170
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:50,409
So a few meter maids
bite the dust, who cares?

171
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:52,181
People off each other
all the time.

172
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:54,249
No, Maze, you
don't understand.

173
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:56,178
This will accelerate.

174
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:59,183
Passing from human to human,
leaving an unimaginable trail

175
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:00,686
of destruction in its wake.

176
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:03,417
Yes, nasty little thing.

177
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:05,264
We need to retrieve it.

178
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:08,929
Oh, I'm so glad you're
on board with this, Luci.

179
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,099
I mean, who would've thought
that bringing celestial objects

180
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,928
to Earth might lead
to such destruction?

181
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,374
Ooh, I like the smug.

182
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:16,939
Much sexier than the earnest.

183
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,437
I'm just surprised that
you would actually take

184
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:20,209
a little bit of responsibility.

185
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:21,607
I thought an unmarked grave
in the middle of nowhere

186
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:22,608
would be safe enough.

187
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,439
Clearly I was wrong.

188
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:27,105
But... I clean up my messes.

189
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:28,314
(chuckles)

190
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:31,445
Well, good luck, you two.

191
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:32,552
(chuckles)

192
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:34,223
You'll want to help, Maze.

193
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:35,321
No, thanks.

194
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:38,222
Let me remind you, I have a job.

195
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:41,455
And let me remind you that the
blade doesn't just kill humans.

196
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:43,732
It also obliterates
celestial beings,

197
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,630
including demons.

198
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,972
So, say the detective were to
find it and bring it home...

199
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,968
I get snuffed out
for not doing the dishes.

200
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,100
Which is why

201
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:52,474
the detective can't be part
of this investigation.

202
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:53,643
Now,

203
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,340
I'll need you two
to move Uriel's body.

204
00:07:57,344 --> 00:08:00,414
Somewhere it won't be
found this time.

205
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,652
Very well.

206
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,121
And one note,

207
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:08,149
you're to do so without
disturbing the grave site

208
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:11,055
in the slightest, specifically
that footprint there.

209
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,362
MAZE:
Why?

210
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,060
Because I'm going to get an
expert to help me examine it.

211
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:20,626
ELLA:
<i> You need a favor?</i>

212
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:25,004
Yes, your scientific expertise
on a discreet matter.

213
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:25,995
Mm.

214
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,336
Paternity test?

215
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:29,671
What? Do I look like someone
who'd be so irresponsible?

216
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:33,184
Uh, regardless, if
you do this favor for me,

217
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,680
then I'll do a favor
for you in return.

218
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,151
Lucifer,

219
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:39,549
the whole point of a favor is
to do it for free, okay?

220
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:43,123
And then you just trust the love
will come back to you somehow.

221
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:44,493
Favors are about faith.

222
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:46,791
Ugh. Please don't
ruin favors for me.

223
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:48,063
Look, come on, I insist.

224
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:49,061
Tit for tat.

225
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:53,162
Fine, um...

226
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,696
Well, there is something
that I would like.

227
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:56,802
Mm?

228
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:59,203
But I'm not sure
you can handle it.

229
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,466
Oh, well, now I'm intrigued.

230
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:03,205
I mean, it might be a little...

231
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,680
inappropriate among colleagues.

232
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,709
Oh, right, even better.

233
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,554
Well, why don't you, uh...

234
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,380
Well...
(whispering): Okay, so...

235
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:13,615
(whispers indistinctly)
Oh.

236
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:22,234
Oh, no, no.

237
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,229
Definitely not.

238
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,060
You're the one
who wanted tit for tat.

239
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,725
(chuckles) Yes, if only
it were that simple.

240
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,235
(sighs)

241
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:31,767
All right, fine.

242
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:33,742
You have a deal.

243
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,210
Gosh, you're a nasty
little nerd, aren't you?

244
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:38,079
¶ ¶

245
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,838
¶ Oh, oh ¶

246
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:41,706
¶ So beautiful ¶

247
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:44,075
¶ Like a love song ¶

248
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,624
¶ You got me singing. ¶

249
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:48,189
Right. Here we are.

250
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:51,088
Does your favor
involve killing me?

251
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,361
(Lucifer chuckles, Ella yelps)

252
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:53,459
I'm just kidding, no.

253
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,360
I need you to do your
forensic whatnots

254
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:58,132
and work out
what disturbed this area.

255
00:09:58,131 --> 00:09:59,261
Uh, you mean this empty grave?

256
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,226
Look,

257
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:03,374
you said to me that favors
were about faith, right?

258
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,600
Yeah.

259
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:06,435
Well, I'm asking you
to have faith in me.

260
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,870
And know that I wouldn't ask
anything untoward of you.

261
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:12,775
You know, when you use my own
words against me like that,

262
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,309
it's actually
really hard to say no.

263
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:15,614
I know.

264
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:18,116
There's some very interesting
footprints over there.

265
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:22,488
ELLA: Well, it looks like
we got a man's sneaker.

266
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:24,759
Okay, I'll take a mold,
but assuming

267
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:27,128
it's one of the major brands,
I mean, you're looking at a pool

268
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,387
of, like, two million dudes
in L.A.

269
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:32,156
Maybe 10,000 robust ladies.

270
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:34,895
Well, I was hoping for something
a little more specific.

271
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:38,441
Thai's not how
analytical science works.

272
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:41,138
Whoa.

273
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,841
Someone tried to burn something.

274
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:47,248
It looks like there's
writing on one s...

275
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:49,407
side.
(chuckles)

276
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,676
Yeah, I should be able to
reconstruct this at the lab.

277
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:53,445
Ah, excellent.

278
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:55,823
Right, whilst you do that,
I'll get back to the detective.

279
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,662
Oh, and remember...

280
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:59,288
Yeah, don't tell anyone

281
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:01,532
about your super creepy
non-grave grave.

282
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:03,898
Got it.

283
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:08,832
CHLOE:
<i> So you worked here</i>
<i> with the deceased?</i>

284
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,165
We didn't just work together.

285
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,471
I mean, Maddie was a friend.

286
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:16,443
The person who introduced me
to the Glory Way.

287
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:19,713
God, I can't believe
that she's dead.

288
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:21,713
I'm sorry.
The glory what?

289
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:22,945
The glory hole.

290
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:24,179
The Glory Way.

291
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,324
Ah.
Developed by

292
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:27,518
our guru, Jenson Glory.

293
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:31,521
The Glory Way is a mind
and body sensibility system

294
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:33,855
designed to reveal what we call

295
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,690
the "home you."

296
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:37,856
Right. Do people
actually believe

297
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,504
the word salad that
you're selling?

298
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:40,669
(laughing):
'Cause, I mean, look,

299
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,727
I enjoy a taut,
spandex-wrapped backside

300
00:11:42,736 --> 00:11:44,366
as much as the next chap,

301
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:47,211
but that was one large helping
of spiritual gobbledy-gook.

302
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,507
Follow Jenson's teachings and
you<i> will</i> uncover your true self.

303
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:50,879
And what if

304
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:54,307
your true self is a 400-pound
nimrod with flatulence issues?

305
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:57,584
Just saying. Some things
are better left buried.

306
00:11:57,584 --> 00:11:59,584
CHLOE:
Given the specifics
of the murder,

307
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:02,716
we're looking for someone who
had a real hatred for Maddie.

308
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:04,393
Does anyone come to mind?

309
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:08,561
No. Maddie was a wholesome soul,
a true light.

310
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:09,892
What about petty grievances?

311
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,596
Perhaps Maddie drank
someone's probiotic smoothie

312
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:14,228
or did one too many peacock
poses for someone's taste?

313
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,374
Lucifer.
No.

314
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:16,768
Just... think.

315
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,770
There must be
some little disagreements.

316
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:20,412
So why don't you
write us up a list?

317
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,837
Anyone who so much as raised
a patchouli-scented eyebrow

318
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:24,743
in Maddie's direction
could be the killer.

319
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:26,435
See...
Excuse us.

320
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,584
That's not the profile

321
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,423
of the murderer
we're investigating.

322
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:32,918
I'm just being thorough,
Detective.

323
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:36,619
Like you said, "Shake the bushes
until the truth flies free."

324
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:38,463
I don't think
I've ever said that before.

325
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,458
No?
Uh-uh.

326
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,730
Oh. Perhaps it was Ms. Lopez.

327
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:45,929
Mm. You've been spending
a lot of time with Ella.

328
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,272
You know, working
together, I mean.

329
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,398
(clears her throat)
Not particularly.

330
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:51,943
Hmm.

331
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,268
Shall we see
how this list is getting on?

332
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,644
Mm-hmm.

333
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:59,913
(humming)

334
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:02,053
Glad to see you're
hard at work.

335
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:05,948
You know, studies show that the
brain does some of its best work

336
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,422
when it's not trying.

337
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,790
That's why great ideas come
in the shower.

338
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,590
For me, it's
usually women.
Hmm.

339
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:12,961
Any progress so far?

340
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,489
Damn straight.
Hmm.

341
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:15,664
I...

342
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:18,962
rehydrated that burnt piece
of paper

343
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,725
we found
at your super creepy place

344
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:22,304
using polyvinyl acetate.

345
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,802
Oh, it's easy
for you to say.
I ran these pieces

346
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:26,395
through a pattern
recognition program,

347
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:27,936
and I found two things.

348
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:31,341
First...

349
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:34,454
what looks to be a map

350
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:37,447
leading from downtown L.A. to
that exact spot you took me to.

351
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,980
Right. What was
the second thing?

352
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,616
Some business logo
of a law firm.

353
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:44,692
What law firm?

354
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:49,587
(computer trilling, beeps)

355
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:51,996
Bloody hell.

356
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:56,801
(door slams)

357
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:59,843
I said no interruptions,
so unless

358
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,840
you're that broad-shouldered
intern from this morning...

359
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:03,472
LUCIFER:
Hello, Mum.

360
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:04,876
Oh. (laughs)

361
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:06,338
Hello, son.

362
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,676
It appears you've been busy.

363
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:17,362
I was getting bored
with my mate and offspring,

364
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:20,117
so I thought
I'd dive into my employment.

365
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:22,686
Not that hard
once you read the law books.

366
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:23,856
What law books?

367
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:25,364
Well, all of them.

368
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,625
Took less than a weekend

369
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:28,473
<i>with</i> time to teach the hubby

370
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:29,868
new tricks.

371
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:33,400
Have you ever heard of something
called the reverse cowgirl?

372
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:34,866
Well, I'm thrilled,

373
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,465
Mum, really, I am.

374
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:39,636
Here you are studying law
<i> and</i> the Kama Sutra.

375
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:42,906
And drawing maps
to Uriel's grave!

376
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:46,751
(laughs)

377
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:48,753
Did someone find the blade?

378
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:51,515
Oh, so you admit
that you led a human to it?

379
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:53,394
Well, not<i> a</i> human.
More like ten.

380
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,393
Ten?
Maybe 12. Uh...

381
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,755
But...
15?

382
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:57,933
Only my craftiest clients.

383
00:14:57,931 --> 00:15:00,061
I mean, I had to make sure
that someone would actually

384
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,926
follow through
and dig the damn thing up.

385
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:04,495
Why in the world
would you tell people?

386
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:05,904
What is wrong with you?!

387
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:08,566
Me? If you didn't want
the blade found,

388
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,905
you shouldn't have left it
in a hole in the ground!

389
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:13,911
A filled-in hole in
the middle of nowhere,

390
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:17,424
which no one would've possibly
found if not for<i> you.</i>

391
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,847
Yes. Well... there's that.

392
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:22,193
Besides, where else
am I gonna hide it?

393
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:25,718
Lux? You know how many people
traipse through there each week?

394
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:27,785
Well, I don't know.
Your bedroom, then.

395
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:29,564
Worse.
Yes.

396
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:30,762
You are sexually prolific.

397
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,464
(laughs)

398
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:34,565
Turns out, you get that from me.

399
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,627
Oh, Mum, why?

400
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:41,566
Why would you release
Azrael's blade into the world?

401
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:44,114
(sighs)

402
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,780
Because I wanted
to get your father's attention.

403
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:51,719
Your brother,

404
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:54,988
Uriel-- my son-- died.

405
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:57,658
Do you think it's crazy
that I wanted to talk about it?

406
00:15:57,657 --> 00:15:59,457
Mourn with him, maybe?!

407
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,959
I...
So I reached out,

408
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:04,002
and guess what I got back.

409
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:05,897
Nothing.
Yes.

410
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:07,629
Like always.

411
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:11,974
So I figured that if his toys
started stabbing each other

412
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:15,472
with a celestial blade, that
maybe he might take a moment.

413
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,475
Humans are dying because of you.

414
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:18,807
Well, humans die.

415
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,142
They all do eventually.

416
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,076
It's what they were
designed to do.

417
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:24,152
Yes, but not
like this.

418
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:30,861
Your vacation here
has changed you.

419
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:32,987
You seem attached
to these creatures,

420
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:38,863
and I can't, for the life of me,
figure out why.

421
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:42,965
Look, you say you want
to stay here on Earth,

422
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:45,869
to live with your sons, right?

423
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:50,172
So, a choice: willingly help me
get the blade back,

424
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:54,676
or I'll send Maze over here
to give you some inspiration.

425
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,820
Hmm. Fine.

426
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:01,819
You're killing
my reverse cowgirl high.

427
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:04,161
I...

428
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:06,017
CHLOE:
<i> LAPD</i>

429
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:08,156
investigation, that's right.

430
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:12,031
Uh, just your whereabouts
around 7:00 a.m. this morning.

431
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:14,002
Okay. Can you prove that?

432
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,970
Right.

433
00:17:15,969 --> 00:17:17,539
Thank you.

434
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:18,867
So the guy that complained

435
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:20,712
Maddie didn't have enough
cool-down time was

436
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:23,667
at an ashram in Sedona,
so, not our guy.

437
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:25,636
My pudding's gone.

438
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:27,075
I'm sorry?

439
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,550
In the break room fridge,
my pudding--

440
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,178
clearly labeled "Dan"--
it's gone.

441
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:32,053
Not the first time, either.

442
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:34,892
Wow. Do you want me
to put some unis on it?

443
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:37,658
Want me to schedule a stakeout?
Are you even okay?
No, Chloe.

444
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:39,687
I'm just saying that a man's
snacks-- they're sacred, okay?

445
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:41,332
Okay.
What up, detective people?

446
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:44,057
Hey.
Hey.

447
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:46,934
Are Lucifer and Ella working on
a case that I don't know about?

448
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:48,703
Mm. Why?

449
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:52,901
No reason, they just seem to be
spending a lot of time together.

450
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:55,706
Is someone jealous?

451
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:56,708
What?

452
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:57,909
No.

453
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:59,081
No way.

454
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,949
Gross.
'Cause you can
tell me if you are.

455
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:03,077
I mean...

456
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,053
we can be there for
each other, as friends.

457
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:07,721
Even... even if
it's about another guy.

458
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,050
Right, but Lucifer's not
another guy.

459
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:11,256
He's a weirdo.

460
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,087
This is about partnership,
nothing more.

461
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:14,293
Partners don't keep secrets.

462
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:15,864
Well, maybe with Ella,

463
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:17,632
it's more than just
sex, maybe it's...

464
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,860
a little more serious.

465
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:20,695
Huh?

466
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,630
No, it's not like Lucifer--
I don't think he...

467
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:24,265
"Not like Lucifer" wha-what?

468
00:18:25,238 --> 00:18:28,608
Likes poker.

469
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,208
Dan has a monthly game.

470
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,740
Oh, no,
I love a good gamble.

471
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:32,744
Count me in.

472
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:34,105
Right, where's that list
of grievances

473
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:35,614
against poor Maddie?

474
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:36,745
Oh, it's the...
Yeah.

475
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:38,119
There-- all right, there you go.
Lovely, thank you.

476
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:39,778
Why would you do that?

477
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,816
Okay, now you're making it
weird.
You're making it weird.

478
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:43,821
CHLOE: You're making it weirder.
DAN: Sorry.

479
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:45,793
CHLOE:
I'll make it weird on your face.

480
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:48,062
Duncan Watts is our killer.

481
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:49,261
What makes you say that?

482
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:50,462
Well, just a hunch.

483
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:54,932
Duncan Watts.

484
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:57,644
His offices are upstairs
above the yoga studio.

485
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,637
Oh, and he's Maddie
and Corrina's landlord.

486
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:02,639
DAN:
Duncan was apparently upset that
Maddie kept parking in his spot.

487
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:03,912
He also tried

488
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,910
to have the yoga studio
evicted a few months ago.

489
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:08,152
Neither of which is really
a reason for 19 stabs.

490
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:10,648
Yes, but just look at
his stabby mug, hmm?

491
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,420
Blond hair, thick neck, which
suggests Cro-Magnon strength.

492
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:15,789
Just as our dear
Ella guesstimated.

493
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:17,318
Ah, "dear Ella," hmm.

494
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:18,323
Where you going?

495
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,194
I'm just off to see
this Duncan chap.

496
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:21,333
No.

497
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,657
We will go together
like partners, okay?

498
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:27,333
Right, yes, I-I just need to
make a quick phone call first.

499
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,003
Oh, okay. No worries.

500
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,673
Private phone call, Detective.

501
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,171
Just give me a moment.

502
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:34,873
Yeah, sure.

503
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:37,939
(loud clattering)
MAZE: You sure this
is the right place?

504
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:39,184
AMENADIEL:
Duncan Watts, Maze.

505
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,249
That's the name Lucifer gave me.

506
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:50,449
I got nothing.

507
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:52,116
Yeah, me neither.

508
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:55,055
Even if we find the blade,
it's a temporary fix.

509
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:56,361
Your mom is the problem.

510
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:57,702
(scoffs)

511
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,697
She released the blade
to create chaos,

512
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,699
and you two respond
by coddling her.

513
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,371
Nobody's coddling her,
all right?

514
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,139
Tell yourself whatever you want,

515
00:20:05,138 --> 00:20:08,368
but you know it's true,
and it explains a lot.

516
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,214
Explains what?

517
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,910
(soft chuckle)

518
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:13,841
Doesn't really matter anymore,

519
00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:17,316
but, just so you know,
this whole mama's boy thing?

520
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:19,217
Kind of a turnoff.

521
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:20,889
Oh, yeah?

522
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:22,747
Well, your whole
"skintight leather,

523
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:24,015
hot body everywhere" thing?

524
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:27,233
Mm-hmm?
It's really not that...

525
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:31,397
It's not-- it's not
that-that great.

526
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:34,097
Yeah, it is.

527
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,900
(car pulling up)

528
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:37,872
They're here.

529
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,400
Yeah, we should probably
warn Lucifer.

530
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:47,875
Well?
There's no blade.

531
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,750
(sighs)
Right, use the back way out.

532
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,119
(scoffs)

533
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:53,417
Ah, Detective,

534
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,089
you know, after reflection,
I think you're right.

535
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:56,918
Parking space thievery is
no motive for murder.

536
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:57,923
(chuckles)

537
00:20:57,924 --> 00:20:59,464
What is going on with you?

538
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:00,929
First, you're so
eager to get here,

539
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:03,227
you practically jump out
of my car before I've parked,

540
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:04,429
and now you want to leave.

541
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,030
What are you hiding?

542
00:21:06,032 --> 00:21:08,472
Hiding?
What would I be hiding?

543
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:10,228
Blood.

544
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:12,996
What?

545
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:24,454
This is Unit 831
requesting backup.

546
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,520
Soul Depot,
15534 Hillgreen Drive.

547
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:43,397
It's Duncan.

548
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:45,473
Oh, must've been
some parking space.

549
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,476
Uh, Detective.

550
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,408
Yeah.

551
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:58,084
Seems this class took corpse
pose quite literally.

552
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:08,491
(indistinct police radio
chatter)

553
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:11,204
(camera shutter clicking)

554
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:13,257
So, no sign of
the murder weapon?

555
00:22:13,266 --> 00:22:14,466
Uh-uh.

556
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:16,097
Are you sure?

557
00:22:16,102 --> 00:22:19,102
Right. Nothing left for us
to do here then, I suppose.

558
00:22:19,105 --> 00:22:21,505
Except for figuring out
how six people were killed.

559
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:24,107
I'm thinking the
primary killer was Duncan.

560
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,010
Killing Maddie didn't satiate
his anger,

561
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:28,982
so he went after her clients
and probably got stabbed

562
00:22:28,981 --> 00:22:30,381
when one of them
defended themselves.

563
00:22:30,383 --> 00:22:32,023
I doubt it. More likely
the weapon was passed

564
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:33,378
from one person to the next

565
00:22:33,386 --> 00:22:35,146
in a game of
murderous hot potato.

566
00:22:35,154 --> 00:22:36,354
That's insane.

567
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:37,856
Eh.
I know, right?

568
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:41,127
Totally insane and probably
exactly what happened.

569
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:43,287
I say this with huge
respect for the dead,

570
00:22:43,296 --> 00:22:45,126
but this case is totally
gonna be a panel

571
00:22:45,131 --> 00:22:46,301
at the next
forensic conference.

572
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:48,169
Okay. So based
on my preliminary

573
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:49,467
assessment of
the wounds,

574
00:22:49,469 --> 00:22:52,369
it looks like Duncan
came through the door,

575
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:54,972
attacked victim number two
with the same weapon

576
00:22:54,974 --> 00:22:56,174
used to kill Maddie Howard.

577
00:22:56,175 --> 00:22:58,875
But Duncan had ligature
marks on his neck,

578
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:00,538
like someone
strangled him

579
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,076
from behind with
a yoga strap.

580
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:04,011
Like... this, here.

581
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:05,246
Oh.
Right?

582
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:07,221
Which is when
he attacked

583
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,490
victim number three.

584
00:23:09,489 --> 00:23:12,089
But victim number three
had defensive wounds

585
00:23:12,091 --> 00:23:13,391
that matched skin flecks

586
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:15,363
under the fingernails
of number four,

587
00:23:15,361 --> 00:23:16,891
so I'm thinking Duncan

588
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:18,396
dropped the knife...

589
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:22,068
Okay, number four
picked it up, right?

590
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:25,068
Attacked number three,
like this.
Mmm.

591
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:27,041
Right, and then
at some point,

592
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,909
number five
got involved.

593
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:31,408
And so on and so on,
until full yoga massacre.

594
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:33,341
Oh, that will be
what the panel's called,

595
00:23:33,346 --> 00:23:34,576
Full Yoga Massacre

596
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,250
2016.
Very good.

597
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:38,179
Okay, so, say that all happened
like you just said it did,

598
00:23:38,184 --> 00:23:39,584
which is crazy.

599
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:41,445
There are seven mats
and seven bodies.

600
00:23:41,454 --> 00:23:43,024
Yeah. So?

601
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:44,592
So Duncan was the
pissed off landlord,

602
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,190
not the class attendee.

603
00:23:46,192 --> 00:23:48,292
Subtract him,
we're missing one yogi.

604
00:23:48,294 --> 00:23:49,594
Okay, well, all of
the bodies were situated

605
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:53,495
around these six mats--
the student mats.

606
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:59,300
So that could be
the teacher's mat, maybe.

607
00:23:59,305 --> 00:24:01,235
The teacher must
have been here.

608
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,270
Get this.

609
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:05,206
Teacher training taught by

610
00:24:05,211 --> 00:24:07,241
Jenson Glory himself.

611
00:24:07,246 --> 00:24:08,246
I mean,

612
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:09,547
his body's not
among the dead.

613
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:11,079
Could be our
missing victim.

614
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:13,153
Slash attacker.

615
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:17,719
CHLOE:
Guy's a piece of work.

616
00:24:17,723 --> 00:24:20,623
Jenson Glory, his real
name is Jamie Ostrowski.

617
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,956
Soul Depot is the latest
in a long line of

618
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,632
failed fitness enterprises.

619
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,960
Glory has five fraud lawsuits,

620
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:29,296
two sexual harassment claims
working their way

621
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:30,332
through the court system.

622
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:32,966
Sexual harassment?

623
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,342
Yeah, former assistants.

624
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,470
Both beautiful
young women,

625
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:36,505
like Maddie.

626
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:38,339
Oh, and look at the contract
that they sign

627
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:40,144
when students join Soul Depot.

628
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:42,346
"I surrender myself
to Soul Depot,

629
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:43,748
"body, mind and soul,

630
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:45,979
"and to the only true guru
of health and serenity,

631
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:48,115
Jenson Glory." Wow.

632
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,320
Pretty much a cult.

633
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:50,492
Think he brainwashed
his students

634
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,620
into a Jonestown
type thing?

635
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:54,455
Kind of a stretch, right?

636
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,760
That a yoga pun?

637
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:58,431
No. It's an honest question.

638
00:24:58,431 --> 00:25:02,001
I mean, drinking cyanide juice
is one thing,

639
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:04,301
but a bunch of people
stabbing each other?

640
00:25:04,303 --> 00:25:06,173
Totally insane!

641
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:08,672
A magic blade in Los Angeles

642
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:11,544
which belongs to
the Angel of Death?

643
00:25:11,544 --> 00:25:14,014
Now, in the hands
of a yogi shyster

644
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:16,453
who's apparently touchy-feely
in more ways than one.

645
00:25:16,449 --> 00:25:18,019
Okay, can we go back

646
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:19,517
to the Angel of Death?

647
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:21,189
Is he... uh,

648
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:22,547
is he another one of
your brothers?

649
00:25:22,555 --> 00:25:24,355
Sister, actually.

650
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:27,157
The Angel of Death is a chick?

651
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:28,189
Yes, I sort of wish we were

652
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:29,534
back to talking in metaphors.

653
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:31,529
That makes two of us.
Because I do actually

654
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:33,531
have things that I'd like
to talk about, Doctor.

655
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:35,703
Oh. Oh, yes. I'm so sorry.

656
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:37,171
Yes. Please.

657
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:38,469
Right.

658
00:25:38,471 --> 00:25:41,211
So, my mum asked me why
I care so much

659
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:42,367
about these people dying

660
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:45,305
and I'm not sure I know.

661
00:25:45,311 --> 00:25:48,351
I mean, it's not like
I know them personally,

662
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:50,047
and Maze is right--

663
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:52,549
even without Azrael's blade,
humans are capricious.

664
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:54,052
(laughing):
Hell,

665
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,523
they're willing to
trade their souls

666
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:57,391
to lose unsightly tummy fat,
but...

667
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:00,690
So...
(sighs)

668
00:26:00,693 --> 00:26:02,533
why should I feel bad?

669
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:03,728
Why should I feel responsible?

670
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:05,329
And... why

671
00:26:05,331 --> 00:26:07,101
am I doing my
own therapy?

672
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:09,329
Lucifer, I'm sorry.

673
00:26:09,335 --> 00:26:11,435
I'm trying to digest
this whole thing

674
00:26:11,437 --> 00:26:13,567
myself.
And, well,

675
00:26:13,573 --> 00:26:17,743
there is no listing in the DSM-5
for Azrael's Blade Anxiety.

676
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:18,783
(phone buzzes)
Oh.

677
00:26:18,778 --> 00:26:20,608
Excuse me.

678
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,208
Ah,

679
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:26,746
the guru with the doo-doo juju
has been picked up.

680
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:29,192
So, I'm afraid that's all we've
got time for today.

681
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:34,530
Just... call me if you
need to reschedule.

682
00:26:35,461 --> 00:26:37,761
I wasn't even
at the studio, actually.

683
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:40,103
That's not what
the schedule says.

684
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:42,199
May I have a tea?

685
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:44,301
Siberian ginseng
if you have it.

686
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:46,765
Well...

687
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,542
Hello, Richard Simmons.

688
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:49,741
Sorry I'm late.

689
00:26:49,742 --> 00:26:51,242
Where's the knife?

690
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:53,883
Who is this tense man?

691
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:55,279
Okay,

692
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:56,611
back to the teacher
training class.

693
00:26:56,616 --> 00:26:58,246
Can you prove that
you weren't there?

694
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,320
Of course, there's
a computer system--

695
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:02,289
all of the teachers have
to swipe a key card.

696
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:04,118
Even me. Check it.

697
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:05,663
So, where were you?

698
00:27:05,658 --> 00:27:07,288
Home.

699
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:09,493
I missed the
last few classes, actually.

700
00:27:09,495 --> 00:27:11,795
I've been... sick.

701
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:13,897
Obsessing over a
new toy, more like.

702
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:15,669
What are you talking about?

703
00:27:15,668 --> 00:27:17,768
I'm talking about something
that's probably beckoning you

704
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:19,240
as we speak.

705
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:20,468
Whispering to you

706
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:22,273
to do terrible things.

707
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:24,584
Wretched, sinful deeds.

708
00:27:25,511 --> 00:27:28,611
That-- that's true...

709
00:27:28,614 --> 00:27:29,684
I-I want...

710
00:27:29,682 --> 00:27:31,422
Go on, tell me. Tell
me what you want,

711
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:33,277
what you really,
really want.

712
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:34,545
I want...

713
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:38,924
a raspberry cream cheese muffin.

714
00:27:38,924 --> 00:27:40,664
And-- and-and

715
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,660
to take this thing...

716
00:27:41,661 --> 00:27:43,331
off!

717
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:44,829
Oh, my...
Oh.

718
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,360
Expecting twins, are we?

719
00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:48,925
Hey, I backslid
a little bit, all right?

720
00:27:48,934 --> 00:27:50,934
Carbs are the
Devil's spawn, man.

721
00:27:50,936 --> 00:27:52,666
Don't blame your
weaknesses on me.

722
00:27:52,672 --> 00:27:54,442
Huh?
Is that why you
didn't show up

723
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,170
to the class? Because
you gained weight?

724
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:58,675
Of course. No one's gonna
find their "home self"

725
00:27:58,678 --> 00:28:01,548
from a guru who looks like he
ate all the furniture.

726
00:28:01,547 --> 00:28:02,647
Well, I think I'd
rather be chubby

727
00:28:02,648 --> 00:28:05,178
than a handsy dipstick
in a corset.

728
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:06,384
That's it.

729
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:08,515
I want my lawyer now.

730
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:10,521
Well, don't eat him.

731
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:12,863
¶ ¶

732
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:17,534
All right, listen,
we searched Glory's house,

733
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,560
his car,
his other car...

734
00:28:19,565 --> 00:28:21,465
there is no blade.

735
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:23,267
We did find a safe
in the basement.

736
00:28:27,573 --> 00:28:28,713
Pop-Tarts.

737
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:30,708
Which... you stole?

738
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,210
Ah, I figured
it's a win-win.

739
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,481
I'm saving the evil guru
from future fat,

740
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,480
and, you know,

741
00:28:35,481 --> 00:28:37,551
Pop-Tarts.

742
00:28:38,751 --> 00:28:41,351
Mr. Glory has a second
home in Ventura.

743
00:28:41,353 --> 00:28:42,723
If you wouldn't mind.

744
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:43,722
Okay, we'll check it out,

745
00:28:43,723 --> 00:28:45,593
but...

746
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:47,261
Luci, if he's the one
with the blade,

747
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:48,729
he's much more likely
to go on a killing spree

748
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:49,958
than to stash it.

749
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:54,897
(elevator bell dings)

750
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:01,643
(elevator bell dings)

751
00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:06,009
Ah. Come back
for your processed pastries?

752
00:29:06,011 --> 00:29:08,411
Ms. Lopez!

753
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:10,254
Well, this is
a surprise.

754
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,679
Have you found something new?

755
00:29:11,684 --> 00:29:14,694
Oh, I found something all right.

756
00:29:14,687 --> 00:29:16,687
Proof of Bigfoot?

757
00:29:16,689 --> 00:29:18,389
Tread on the shoes
Duncan Watts was wearing

758
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,760
when he was found dead.

759
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:21,259
Tread that you showed me

760
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,890
at your super weirdo
hole in the ground.

761
00:29:23,896 --> 00:29:27,256
They match, which means
that this case

762
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:28,266
and your favor

763
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:29,767
are connected.

764
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:31,369
Start talkin', dude.

765
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:38,939
Do you have something to do
with these murders?
(sighs)

766
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:42,114
Come clean with me.

767
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,154
Or I can't keep this
a secret anymore.

768
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,750
You see, that's just it.

769
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:48,752
The last person
I came clean with

770
00:29:48,754 --> 00:29:50,154
became a tad untethered.

771
00:29:50,156 --> 00:29:52,286
Dude, I grew up in Detroit.

772
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:53,291
Look,

773
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,332
all I can tell you is

774
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:57,957
I'm dealing with a matter
of cosmic importance

775
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:00,903
and I ask you to indulge me
for just a little longer.

776
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,970
You mean have faith?

777
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:04,367
(scoffs)
Tomato, tomahto.

778
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:07,304
Well, I guess faith
isn't faith

779
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:08,736
unless it's tested.

780
00:30:08,741 --> 00:30:10,941
(chuckles)
Bring it in.

781
00:30:10,943 --> 00:30:13,183
What? Oh.

782
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:16,306
(elevator bell dings)

783
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,654
Ella.
Detective.

784
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:22,023
Oh, um...

785
00:30:22,021 --> 00:30:24,021
I was just...

786
00:30:24,023 --> 00:30:26,023
uh, you see,

787
00:30:26,025 --> 00:30:28,785
there's this, uh, store
that has really special...

788
00:30:28,794 --> 00:30:29,794
soap.

789
00:30:29,795 --> 00:30:31,695
And, you know,

790
00:30:31,697 --> 00:30:33,797
but I should really
get going now and...

791
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:36,329
clean stuff with the soap.

792
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:38,735
Bye!
Enjoy your shower.

793
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:42,772
So, um...

794
00:30:42,775 --> 00:30:44,165
to what do I owe
this pleasure?

795
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:47,036
Jenson's home security system
shows video of him sleeping

796
00:30:47,046 --> 00:30:49,306
during the murders,
so he wasn't lying about that.

797
00:30:49,315 --> 00:30:51,775
We checked the key card system
at Soul Depot,

798
00:30:51,784 --> 00:30:53,354
and guess who was
subbing for Jenson.

799
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:54,692
Corrina,

800
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:56,047
Maddie's co-manager.

801
00:30:56,055 --> 00:30:57,315
Right, and where's
Corrina now?

802
00:30:57,323 --> 00:30:58,893
We checked her house,
she wasn't there.

803
00:30:58,891 --> 00:31:00,021
Forensics confirms

804
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:02,025
that she didn't kill anyone
at Soul Depot,

805
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:04,027
so she's either running,
hiding or scared.

806
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:06,029
I put out a BOLO.

807
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:08,701
Yeah, I don't think Corrina's
the one running this time.

808
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:09,701
What?

809
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:12,372
Where are you going?

810
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:14,401
Hello?

811
00:31:18,244 --> 00:31:20,244
¶ Let go ¶

812
00:31:20,246 --> 00:31:22,706
¶ ¶

813
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:25,815
¶ Say come down easier ¶

814
00:31:25,818 --> 00:31:27,848
¶ I know ¶

815
00:31:27,853 --> 00:31:30,393
¶ The fear will wash away ¶

816
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:32,859
LUCIFER:
Hello?

817
00:31:32,858 --> 00:31:36,858
Anyone here yielding a
deadly, celestial blade?

818
00:31:36,862 --> 00:31:40,102
Huh? Anyone?

819
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:42,929
Well, that'll be
a resounding yes.

820
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:48,270
I-- I don't know what happened.

821
00:31:48,274 --> 00:31:51,414
I was in class
and Duncan barged in.

822
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:54,040
It was horrible.

823
00:31:54,046 --> 00:31:56,406
All that killing...

824
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:59,115
and the knife was
on the ground.

825
00:31:59,118 --> 00:32:00,078
It started calling you.

826
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:05,762
Did I do that?

827
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:07,928
Yes.

828
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:10,087
You got retribution
for a grudge, I believe.

829
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:13,525
But it wasn't an
insignificant grudge, was it?

830
00:32:13,532 --> 00:32:16,602
Did he harass you
like the others?

831
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:20,901
Or was it worse
than that?

832
00:32:20,906 --> 00:32:22,766
Years ago.

833
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:26,035
We were alone
in the studio.

834
00:32:27,046 --> 00:32:30,106
I-I-- I said no.

835
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:32,875
I swear, but he
wouldn't stop.

836
00:32:32,885 --> 00:32:36,145
I-I... I tried to forget. I...

837
00:32:36,155 --> 00:32:38,315
You tried to bury it deep,
get on with your life.

838
00:32:38,324 --> 00:32:39,994
You might have
succeeded,

839
00:32:39,992 --> 00:32:41,062
if not for...

840
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,230
(sighs)

841
00:32:42,227 --> 00:32:43,457
...the blade.

842
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,932
LAPD, hands in the air.

843
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:47,801
DAN: Move away from
the body, Corinna.

844
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,000
Now!
I... I-I killed him.

845
00:32:50,002 --> 00:32:51,102
I-I did this.
I...

846
00:32:51,103 --> 00:32:53,173
Acted in self-defense.

847
00:32:53,172 --> 00:32:56,472
Mr. Glory attacked Corrina
first. She had no choice

848
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,475
but to wield that
knife, Detective.

849
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:01,477
I think, in this case, justice
has actually been served.

850
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,917
Henderson, take her statement.

851
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,990
Come with me.

852
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:13,264
Where's the
murder weapon?

853
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:14,828
What?

854
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:16,587
Unis shouldn't have bagged
it without taking photos.

855
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:18,595
They couldn't help themselves.

856
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:20,957
Anyone else feeling
a murderous urge?

857
00:33:20,966 --> 00:33:24,326
No? The need to slice and dice?

858
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:26,436
Anyone?

859
00:33:26,438 --> 00:33:29,008
Oh, God.

860
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:36,406
Oh, no.

861
00:33:39,985 --> 00:33:42,615
Detective Douche...
Daniel. Dan.

862
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:45,361
Why don't you
put down the knife, hmm?

863
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:47,187
Bury the proverbial hatchet
and all that?

864
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:49,892
I mean, I know we've had our
differences in the past, but

865
00:33:49,895 --> 00:33:51,425
we're friends now, right?

866
00:33:56,969 --> 00:33:59,299
You ruined my marriage.

867
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,610
I'll take that as a no.

868
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:08,549
My life went to hell
when I met you!

869
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:10,507
Hey! Well, technically, that's
not true, but I understand

870
00:34:10,516 --> 00:34:11,876
the basic metaphor.

871
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:14,254
(yells)

872
00:34:14,253 --> 00:34:17,253
Easy with the blade,
Detective.

873
00:34:17,256 --> 00:34:20,156
One deep cut, and yours truly
could be wiped from existence.

874
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,659
Prayers answered.

875
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,260
(yells)
(slices)

876
00:34:23,262 --> 00:34:26,162
What...

877
00:34:26,165 --> 00:34:28,025
Okay, Detective,

878
00:34:28,033 --> 00:34:31,233
I can assure you your current
mood will be rectified

879
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:34,036
by simply putting down
the knife.

880
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:37,409
My entire life imploded
because of you.

881
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,039
What?
My marriage!

882
00:34:39,044 --> 00:34:40,084
(grunts)

883
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,249
My job.

884
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:43,447
My snacks.

885
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:44,579
What?

886
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,583
I know you ate my pudding.

887
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:47,575
(grunts)

888
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:49,516
You're really
going to smite me

889
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:51,461
over a tub of sweetened goo?

890
00:34:51,457 --> 00:34:53,957
(yells)

891
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:55,589
You're damn right I am.

892
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:59,034
Dan... Dan.

893
00:34:59,031 --> 00:35:01,431
Recent friend.
Growing compatriot.

894
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:03,933
Your marriage
was already on the rocks.

895
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:06,566
You started cutting procedural
corners way before I arrived,

896
00:35:06,572 --> 00:35:08,072
and as for your pudding...

897
00:35:08,073 --> 00:35:10,943
(exclaims)
As for your pudding, I...

898
00:35:10,943 --> 00:35:12,313
Okay, yes.

899
00:35:12,311 --> 00:35:14,211
I sometimes lay waste
to the precinct fridge.

900
00:35:14,213 --> 00:35:15,453
But have mercy, Daniel.

901
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:17,307
How was I supposed
to know it was yours?

902
00:35:17,316 --> 00:35:20,216
Because it was labeled!

903
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:29,088
You're fighting the blade,
which indicates a strength

904
00:35:29,094 --> 00:35:32,334
I didn't know you had.
Look at me in the eye.

905
00:35:32,331 --> 00:35:34,061
Look at me.

906
00:35:35,067 --> 00:35:36,627
Your marriage.

907
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:38,695
Did I ruin it?

908
00:35:40,572 --> 00:35:41,742
No.

909
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,970
No.

910
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:45,976
We were separated before
Chloe even met you.

911
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:48,308
And your career?

912
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:51,083
Palmetto... was all me.

913
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:53,083
Yeah. Yeah.

914
00:35:53,085 --> 00:35:55,145
(grunts)

915
00:35:56,155 --> 00:35:58,255
(exhales)

916
00:35:58,257 --> 00:36:00,117
W-What are we
doing back here?

917
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:01,985
Hmm? Oh, just a nice,

918
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:03,464
intimate chat between friends.

919
00:36:03,462 --> 00:36:05,532
I'm glad you got it
off your chest.

920
00:36:05,531 --> 00:36:07,001
Oh, man, you're bleeding.

921
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:08,269
What? Oh.

922
00:36:08,267 --> 00:36:09,467
No, it's just
a scratch, really.

923
00:36:09,468 --> 00:36:11,668
Nothing to worry about.
And you?

924
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,140
How are you doing?

925
00:36:13,138 --> 00:36:14,668
(laughs)

926
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:17,013
I feel great, actually.

927
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:18,339
Good.

928
00:36:22,014 --> 00:36:23,254
Good talk.

929
00:36:24,216 --> 00:36:26,246
¶ Oh ¶

930
00:36:28,053 --> 00:36:29,723
¶ Hey, hey, hey ¶

931
00:36:32,057 --> 00:36:35,457
¶ Oh, yeah. ¶

932
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:38,695
Ah! Good morning,
Detective.

933
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,197
Everything all right?

934
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:42,169
No. Heads are gonna roll.

935
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:44,697
First, some tech pulled
the murder weapon

936
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:47,243
without documentation,
and now it's just gone.

937
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:50,039
Right. Well,
it's probably for the best.

938
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:52,212
Nasty bit of steel, anyway.

939
00:36:53,078 --> 00:36:55,248
So, one second
you're obsessed

940
00:36:55,247 --> 00:36:58,047
with the knife,
and now it's just no big deal?

941
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:00,680
Well, we got the murderer,
didn't we? Job done.

942
00:37:00,686 --> 00:37:03,516
You know, Lucifer...

943
00:37:03,522 --> 00:37:06,392
I thought you and I had
a real moment the other day,

944
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:07,721
talking about my dad, I...

945
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,556
I thought we
were partners,

946
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:11,491
but more importantly, friends.

947
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:15,165
(clears throat)

948
00:37:15,167 --> 00:37:17,197
Right.

949
00:37:17,202 --> 00:37:19,602
Is this about me and Ella
in the penthouse?

950
00:37:19,605 --> 00:37:22,565
Look, who you sleep with
is none of my business,

951
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:23,844
but...

952
00:37:23,842 --> 00:37:26,242
I mean, the lab tech? Really?

953
00:37:26,245 --> 00:37:27,575
It's a little inappropriate.
Well,

954
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:29,509
much as I love to cross
professional boundaries,

955
00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:31,214
Detective, I can assure you,
everything you saw

956
00:37:31,216 --> 00:37:33,276
was entirely work-related.

957
00:37:35,354 --> 00:37:38,364
Mm-hmm? Is that...
is that the truth?

958
00:37:38,357 --> 00:37:40,087
Always the truth.

959
00:37:40,092 --> 00:37:42,362
Point of pride for me,
Detective.

960
00:37:42,361 --> 00:37:43,591
Gotcha.
But you know,

961
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:45,355
if you ever did
want to cross boundaries

962
00:37:45,364 --> 00:37:47,734
into "partnered friends
who hang out naked..."
Okay.

963
00:37:47,733 --> 00:37:49,103
Stop talking.

964
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:51,101
(chuckles)

965
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:53,173
¶ ¶

966
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,609
LINDA:
<i> So, global crisis averted?</i>

967
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,678
(chuckles)
Yes. For now.

968
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,541
So, we can...

969
00:38:01,546 --> 00:38:04,246
you know, talk about
Caligula, Stalin,

970
00:38:04,249 --> 00:38:05,779
Trump. I mean,

971
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:08,394
I know he's not dead,
but he's definitely going.
Lucifer,

972
00:38:08,387 --> 00:38:10,447
I owe you an apology.

973
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,560
But in my defense...

974
00:38:14,893 --> 00:38:16,263
...you're the Devil.
(chuckles)

975
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:17,491
(laughs)

976
00:38:17,496 --> 00:38:19,156
Things were much less
complicated when I thought

977
00:38:19,164 --> 00:38:22,904
you were just another
average delusional patient

978
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:25,641
with a complicated family.

979
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:28,137
Well, I've never
been "average," Linda.

980
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,270
Mentally, physically--
and as you know--

981
00:38:30,275 --> 00:38:31,505
sexually.

982
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:34,140
Oh, my God.

983
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:36,506
I had sex with the Devil.

984
00:38:36,515 --> 00:38:39,575
Many, many times.
And you're welcome.

985
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:41,754
Okay, now, see,
that I understand.

986
00:38:41,753 --> 00:38:44,653
Narcissistic tendencies rooted

987
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,486
in a complex
paternal relationship

988
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,531
and a disrupted adolescence.

989
00:38:48,527 --> 00:38:50,487
See? Just another
screwed up patient.

990
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,355
And you can treat me as such.

991
00:38:52,364 --> 00:38:54,204
(sighs)

992
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:55,529
All right.

993
00:38:55,534 --> 00:38:57,804
Let's do this.

994
00:38:57,803 --> 00:39:00,373
¶ Bound and blind
my hands are tied ¶

995
00:39:00,372 --> 00:39:01,642
The doctor is in.

996
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,540
Lovely.

997
00:39:03,542 --> 00:39:06,182
¶ My weakness
wasn't to declare... ¶

998
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:08,178
LUCIFER:
<i> I really do</i>
<i> have urgent business</i>

999
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,550
to attend to.
Are you certain

1000
00:39:09,548 --> 00:39:11,508
that this is the favor
that you desire?

1001
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:14,176
Because, uh, believe me,
when I say the last two times

1002
00:39:14,186 --> 00:39:15,516
I've darkened the
doorstep of a church,

1003
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,290
insert blood-soaked
carnage here.
Again,

1004
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:19,690
with the drama!

1005
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:22,361
We solved your case,
now I get my favor.

1006
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:24,831
Just go with me, okay?

1007
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:27,700
Look, since the moment
we've met,

1008
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:30,869
okay, I've had this Spidey-sense
that you were...

1009
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:33,869
I don't know,
searching for something.

1010
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:36,472
Right. Spiritual lost and found.
Yes!

1011
00:39:36,475 --> 00:39:38,875
And I have found a lot
since I developed a relationship

1012
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:41,707
with the Big Guy,
and... so might you.

1013
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:44,513
Trust me. We're much closer
than you think.

1014
00:39:44,516 --> 00:39:46,376
Well, then, no harm, no foul.

1015
00:39:46,385 --> 00:39:47,745
I beg to differ.

1016
00:39:47,753 --> 00:39:49,493
Oh.

1017
00:39:49,488 --> 00:39:51,348
On second thought...

1018
00:39:51,356 --> 00:39:53,216
What?

1019
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:56,425
I should at least give someone
a reason to go to confession.

1020
00:39:57,362 --> 00:40:00,362
¶<i> Ooh...</i> ¶

1021
00:40:00,365 --> 00:40:01,965
¶ Bad blood ¶

1022
00:40:03,668 --> 00:40:05,668
¶ Bad blood. ¶

1023
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,740
(sighs)

1024
00:40:09,341 --> 00:40:10,911
So, where will you put it,
brother?

1025
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:13,379
Somewhere far away
from our mum,

1026
00:40:13,378 --> 00:40:15,448
for starters.

1027
00:40:16,381 --> 00:40:18,551
Mm!

1028
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,620
And speak of the Devil's mum.

1029
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:22,389
Well, that was fast.

1030
00:40:22,387 --> 00:40:25,387
You couldn't have waited
a day or two to find it?

1031
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:26,790
There hasn't been nearly
enough carnage.

1032
00:40:26,792 --> 00:40:28,562
Now we'll never hear
from your father.

1033
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,930
LUCIFER:
All the killing in the world

1034
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:31,928
may not have gotten
his attention, Mum.

1035
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,900
Surely you've
learned that by now.

1036
00:40:33,899 --> 00:40:35,529
Uriel was our son.

1037
00:40:35,534 --> 00:40:36,804
Your brother.

1038
00:40:36,802 --> 00:40:38,642
We should grieve together.

1039
00:40:38,637 --> 00:40:40,937
I don't think that's
all this is about.

1040
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:43,539
You want something from Him.

1041
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:44,942
What is it?

1042
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:46,943
What I've always wanted.

1043
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:49,775
I want my family back.

1044
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:51,411
I'm afraid that's not possible.

1045
00:40:51,416 --> 00:40:52,546
Oh, but it is.

1046
00:40:52,551 --> 00:40:55,751
With my two sons by my side,
a united front,

1047
00:40:55,754 --> 00:40:57,954
your father will be forced
to listen to reason.

1048
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,716
Force Dad?

1049
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:02,434
I think human delusion
is rubbing off on you, Mother.

1050
00:41:02,427 --> 00:41:04,727
Tell her.

1051
00:41:04,729 --> 00:41:07,699
Luci, I can't,
because I agree with her.

1052
00:41:09,668 --> 00:41:10,868
(sets down glass)

1053
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,674
I thought you were
just Team Mum

1054
00:41:14,673 --> 00:41:16,813
because you couldn't
fly her back to Hell.

1055
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,978
Since when did you turn?
Now,

1056
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:21,677
more than ever, I know
that humanity and divinity

1057
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,680
do not mix.

1058
00:41:22,681 --> 00:41:24,851
That... that blade, Luci.

1059
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:28,320
That blade was the last straw.
It shouldn't be here.

1060
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,620
<i> We</i> shouldn't be here.

1061
00:41:30,622 --> 00:41:32,022
(laughing):
Well,

1062
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:34,823
I am not going back to Hell.
Oh, this isn't about

1063
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,526
returning to Hell.

1064
00:41:36,528 --> 00:41:38,528
This is about Heaven.

1065
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:40,600
It's about going home.

1066
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:41,869
Home.

1067
00:41:41,867 --> 00:41:43,497
For you, maybe.

1068
00:41:43,502 --> 00:41:45,772
Neither of you
understand, do you?

1069
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,340
You never have.

1070
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:50,609
Hell wasn't home,
and Heaven was...

1071
00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:52,009
well... hell!

1072
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,340
The only place
I've ever felt

1073
00:41:54,346 --> 00:41:56,676
wanted or respected...

1074
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:58,351
Is here?
With humanity?

1075
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,920
Yes. This is my home.

1076
00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:05,115
Deal with it, Mother.

1077
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:08,761
Fine.

1078
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:11,464
Fine.

1079
00:42:11,463 --> 00:42:14,533
No sense arguing.

1080
00:42:14,533 --> 00:42:16,473
Time to go.

1081
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:21,741
Careful.

1082
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,940
It's sharp.

1083
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,710
What's that saying?

1084
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:34,546
"When my dear husband
closes a door,

1085
00:42:34,553 --> 00:42:36,623
he opens a window"?

1086
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,460
The window just opened.
