<i> Previously on</i> Lucifer...
Everything I felt for her

2
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:05,337
was smoke and mirrors,
courtesy of Dad.

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,206
DAN:
<i> Did you sleep with me</i>
<i> to get intel on this case?</i>

4
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:09,341
MOM:<i> Of course. </i>
What are you doing here?

5
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:12,211
You don't let your girl
go into enemy territory alone.

6
00:00:12,213 --> 00:00:14,346
The piece is here.

7
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:15,614
My last words were a clue.

8
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:16,949
A clue?
A clue to what?

9
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:19,051
Well, you're the one who has
to figure that out, aren't you?

10
00:00:19,053 --> 00:00:20,686
LUCIFER:
<i> And you really think</i>
<i> that this is</i>

11
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:21,887
the Flaming Sword?

12
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:23,155
It's so not flaming.

13
00:00:23,157 --> 00:00:24,456
That's because only you,

14
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:27,726
my Lightbringer,
can ignite it.

15
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:29,728
That's it.
It's all I've got.

16
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,630
Okay. Then we'll fix it.
There's plenty of time.

17
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:33,966
MOM:
<i> Just not for me.</i>

18
00:00:33,968 --> 00:00:36,568
I do intend to use
the Flaming Sword

19
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,569
<i> to cut through</i>
<i> the Gates of Heaven.</i>

20
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:38,637
<i> Once I do that,</i>

21
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:39,638
I plan on

22
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,806
kicking Mom into Heaven

23
00:00:40,808 --> 00:00:42,741
and slamming the gates
on her backside.

24
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:43,876
Won't God destroy her?

25
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:45,844
Hopefully, they
tear each other apart.

26
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:47,946
Then they'll both get
what they deserve.

27
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:57,156
I'm not the Devil,
I'm just a man who's delusional.

28
00:00:57,158 --> 00:01:01,493
I made it all up.
I made it all... up.

29
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:03,162
(chuckles)

30
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm doing great.

31
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,502
Great.

32
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:13,605
Great is...good...

33
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:16,341
Okay, good talk.

34
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:17,543
Same time next week?

35
00:01:17,545 --> 00:01:20,512
Uh, sorry, it's just that...

36
00:01:20,514 --> 00:01:21,780
some of the things
that you said

37
00:01:21,782 --> 00:01:22,881
in our last session

38
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:26,618
raised some
issues for me.

39
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,887
Do tell.
So this secret plan

40
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:30,889
to cut through the
Gates of Heaven...

41
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:32,758
Well, actually, we've hit
a bit of a snag with that.

42
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,194
The Flaming Sword's kaput.

43
00:01:35,196 --> 00:01:36,562
Now, we can't work out
what's wrong with it,

44
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:39,064
and until we can, we're in
a bit of a holding pattern.

45
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:41,033
Ah, that's a relief.
Well, why would you say that?

46
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:44,369
God and His ex having
a fight to the death?

47
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:47,539
Sounds kind of bad for,
you know, humanity.

48
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:48,807
Oh, you'll probably be fine.

49
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:50,876
<i> Probably?</i>

50
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:52,044
That's not exactly
reassuring.

51
00:01:52,046 --> 00:01:54,713
What does Maze
think of your plan?

52
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:55,881
Well, I don't know.
I haven't told her.

53
00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:57,783
Hence the secret part
of the secret plan.

54
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:59,785
She's your best friend.
Yes, well,

55
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:01,153
as much as I love
my little sex thug,

56
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:03,822
Maze can do things that she
thinks are in my best interest

57
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:06,792
that turn out to be,
well, disastrous.

58
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:07,893
And I can't afford that.

59
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:10,095
Hmm.
But the good news is

60
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:12,731
she's busy focusing
on her new bestie right now.

61
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:13,799
The detective.

62
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:16,368
They're practically
inseparable.

63
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:24,810
Hey, roomie.

64
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:26,912
Where you going?
Maze, hey.

65
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:29,114
Um, I'm on my way to work.
I'm running late.

66
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:30,983
Oh, no, but you haven't
had breakfast, come on.

67
00:02:33,187 --> 00:02:34,820
♪ Mm! ♪

68
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:36,088
No, I'm...
(hard toast clanks on plate)

69
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,323
Oh, yeah, no,
I'm not hungry.

70
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,958
Yeah, I know, the whole

71
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,827
boring domestic thing--
not my jam.

72
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:42,828
I should stick to managing

73
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,429
the social part
of our friendship.

74
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:46,765
You want to kick
someone's ass?
Maze,

75
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:49,434
I feel like, you know, we've
been hanging out a lot lately.

76
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:50,869
And I think

77
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:54,506
perhaps we should expand
our circle of friends.

78
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,175
I got you, Decker.

79
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:57,109
Yeah? You do?

80
00:02:57,111 --> 00:02:59,511
I smell what you're
stepping in.

81
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:02,114
(snaps fingers)
Trust me.

82
00:03:02,116 --> 00:03:04,716
CHLOE:
<i> You know,</i>
<i> you should give a Maze a call.</i>

83
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:06,151
Hasn't it been a while
since you two hung out?

84
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:08,487
Tired of tripping over
her sex toys, are you?

85
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:09,788
I didn't say that.

86
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,157
I just think it would
do her, and me, some good

87
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,692
if she wasn't around
all the time.

88
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,561
Well, here's the thing.
Maze is like one of those

89
00:03:15,563 --> 00:03:17,996
little baby birds that
imprints on whatever's near.

90
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:20,532
Sadly, that's you.
You are the new me.

91
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:23,402
I don't want to be you.
I just want some space.

92
00:03:23,404 --> 00:03:25,304
Oh. Eventually
Maze will find her place,

93
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:28,006
but until then, what's
the worst that could happen?

94
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:30,075
Murder. Confirmed.

95
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:32,578
Blunt-force trauma
to the back of the head.

96
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,481
The victim got hit
with this backgammon board.

97
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:38,050
Not very sportsmanlike.

98
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:40,886
Hmm-mm.
He was an orderly.

99
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,854
Toby Mulligan, 32.

100
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:45,023
Body was found here.
Okay.

101
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:46,758
They interview the staff
or the patients yet?

102
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,328
No, not yet. It's a
psychiatric hospital,

103
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,363
so the staff didn't want
the patients wigging out

104
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:52,197
over the dead body.

105
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,832
They've been busy
moving everyone

106
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:54,833
to a different floor.

107
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:56,501
I love the mentally ill.

108
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:59,071
I mean, who isn't amused by
someone who thinks they're Elvis

109
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:01,340
or Napoleon or
Wesley Snipes?

110
00:04:01,342 --> 00:04:02,441
Who found the body?

111
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:04,009
DAN: God.
Ah! See?!

112
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:05,744
God Johnson, he's a patient.
He's right in there.

113
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:08,046
DAN: The guy actually
thinks he's God.

114
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:09,615
He changed his name
and everything.

115
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:12,184
Oh. You two should have
a lot to talk about.
Yes.

116
00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:14,186
I would like to have a chat
with the Almighty.

117
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:15,787
Cool your jets, man, all right?
There's a whole bunch

118
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:17,055
of bureaucratic hoops
to jump through

119
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,523
to set up an interview.

120
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:21,126
The hospital administrator
has all the info.

121
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:35,440
Well, hello, God.

122
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,442
Hello, my son.

123
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,077
(laughs, stops short)

124
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:40,711
Right, yes, I suppose that
would be the standard way

125
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:42,714
to greet your children.

126
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:43,749
Nice touch.

127
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:45,951
What can I do for you?

128
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:48,487
Well, it's what I can do
for you that's exciting.

129
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:51,923
See, I can reveal the truth
about the Supreme Being

130
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:53,392
you've chosen to impersonate.

131
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:55,394
I bet you wanted
to be God because

132
00:04:55,396 --> 00:04:58,096
He's benevolent,
all-powerful, yada yada.

133
00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:02,234
But in actual
fact, He's a dick.

134
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:07,172
Look, if you want
to be angry with me,

135
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:09,841
you just go right on ahead.

136
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:12,377
I can be anything
you need me to be.

137
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,415
Right, enough of this
idle chit-chat.

138
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:19,618
Time to tell you what
the charade's really about.

139
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,752
What do you desire?

140
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:21,987
Hmm?

141
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,522
To avoid a vengeful ex-wife?

142
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:26,491
Years of back taxes?
What's your game?

143
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:31,530
Is this a staring contest?

144
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:34,099
'Cause, you know,
I'm pretty good at those.

145
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:37,102
How is this possible?

146
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:39,271
Oh, right, yes,
I bet you're on

147
00:05:39,273 --> 00:05:41,106
some really amazing
drugs, aren't you?

148
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:43,008
If so, share-zies.

149
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,944
You're not supposed
to be in here.

150
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:47,279
Oh, never mind.

151
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:50,148
I'm done with this
fraud, anyway.

152
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,184
It was real good
seeing you, Samael.

153
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:55,387
What did you say?

154
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:00,025
Dad?

155

♪ ♪

156
00:06:08,302 --> 00:06:10,869
Has Dad ever visited
Earth before?
Not that I'm aware of.

157
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:13,305
And besides, why would
He do so now?

158
00:06:13,307 --> 00:06:15,207
Mm. I don't know,
maybe because

159
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:16,842
we're plotting
to overthrow Him.

160
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:19,010
Even so, Luci, that's
not the way Dad operates.

161
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:20,645
(sighs)
If He has a problem,

162
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:22,080
He sends an emissary,
like me,

163
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:24,316
or maybe a burning bush.

164
00:06:24,318 --> 00:06:28,353
So how does this God Johnson
know Samael, hmm?

Oh, wait, I know.

167
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,091
You do?
The Internet!

168
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:35,327
It's truly amazing
what you can find online.

169
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:36,728
Have you seen that video
with the cat

170
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,763
that jumps inside the box?

171
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:38,997
Very funny, but
I didn't even

172
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:42,334
introduce myself
as Lucifer.

173
00:06:42,336 --> 00:06:44,503
And there's something
strange about...

174
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:45,670
I can't explain it.

175
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:47,005
Because it's just crazy talk

176
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:48,940
coming from
a mentally ill human.

177
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,611
Well, there might be
another reason.
Right.

178
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:53,779
What's that?

179
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:55,213
Well, Earth is
His favorite toy.

180
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:57,516
Maybe He got fed up of
looking at it from afar.

181
00:06:57,518 --> 00:07:00,552
I mean, it's not an
entirely awful place.

182
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:02,020
Even you have to admit that.

183
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:04,222
Now you're the one sounding
crazy, Luci, because Earth--

184
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:06,925
Earth is nothing
compared to Heaven.

185
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,728
Oh, come now, brother.

186
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,563
I think you've grown to
like the place, haven't you?

187
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:13,598
(scoffs)
Come on, be honest.

188
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,200
When we return to Heaven,
there must be something

189
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:17,068
that you're gonna miss, eh?

190
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,639
Or someone, maybe?

191
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:23,909
Someone in tight leather pants
with a penchant for knives?

192
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:25,377
I'm referring to Maze,
of course.

193
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:30,081
ELLA:
<i> Come on, guys.</i>

194
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,250
Is it really so crazy?

195
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:34,586
I mean, what if God
<i> was</i> one of us?

196
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:36,955
Just a slob,
like one of us.

197
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,423
Exactly.
Or just a...

198
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:39,491
A stranger on a bus.

199
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:41,460
My father would never use
public transport.

200
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:43,061
That song is completely
unrealistic.

201
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,396
What song?
LUCIFER:
The song I hate

202
00:07:44,398 --> 00:07:46,498
almost as much as I hate
these hypocrites,

203
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,999
like God Johnson.

204
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:49,968
Hypocrite?
Hmm, I don't know.

205
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,803
I see some similarities
between the two of you.

206
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,072
That man is not my father.

207
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:57,742
Well, good thing, 'cause
he might be our killer.

208
00:07:57,744 --> 00:07:59,744
<i> Whaaat?</i> Oh, my God, Ella,
how do you know that?

209
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:00,745
I'll tell you how
I know that,

210
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:01,913
because our victim
was bald.

211
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:04,783
It's very hard to
get prints off a body,

212
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:07,586
so I whipped out
the ultraviolet

213
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:10,755
alternate light source,
and...boom, complete set

214
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:12,757
on the victim's noggin.

215
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,259
They match one Earl Johnson,

216
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:16,261
wealthy oil magnate
from Odessa, Texas.

217
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:20,031
Huh. It says here his wife
committed him a few months ago

218
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,933
after he gave
all of his money away

219
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:23,869
and started calling
himself "God."

220
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:27,439
Mr. Johnson never said that
he touched the victim's body.

221
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:29,875
Left out the killing
part as well.

222
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:31,877
And proving he's the killer
is the perfect way

223
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,812
to expose his
false idolatry.

224
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:34,880
Right, shall we?

225
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:36,147
No, we shan't.

226
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:38,450
Because you spoke to him
without permission,

227
00:08:38,452 --> 00:08:40,619
I had to apply
for a special hearing

228
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:41,953
just to interview him.

229
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:43,121
That'll take at least
a few days,

230
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:45,056
so thank you for that.

231
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,032
Hello, there.

232
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,034
I'd like a suite
for the evening, please.

233
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,369
Preferably one with a view.

234
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:58,803
Are you joking?

235
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:00,472
This is a psychiatric
hospital.

236
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:02,307
Apologies,
I'm skipping ahead.

237
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:06,278
Uh, I am the one and only
Lucifer Morningstar.

238
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:10,549
The Devil.
Dark Lord?

239
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:13,652
Oh, for goodness sake,
Beelzebub!

240
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:16,054
Look, I clearly need to be
committed right away.

241
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,189
Yeah, we're at
near capacity, pal.

242
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:22,327
So unless you're a danger
to yourself or others...

243
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:24,029
How's that?
Great.

244
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:26,064
Lovely.

245
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:30,235

246
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:33,371

249
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:39,678
Who stole my pudding again?

250
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,680
Huh?

251
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:43,181
Markowitz?

252
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:44,749
Want a taste?

253
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:50,522
Don't you have
better things to do

254
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:51,523
than to raid our fridge?

255
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:54,025
I was about to leave
this place altogether,

256
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:57,128
but I hit an
unexpected snag.

257
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:00,031
Now I need to distract
myself with something.

258
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:03,668
Hello, something.

259
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:06,972
You know, just in case
I'm giving off an

260
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:09,040
"I have zero
self-respect" vibe,

261
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:11,543
let me make it clear.

262
00:10:11,545 --> 00:10:12,978
Hands off.

263
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,112
(chuckles)

264
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,246
I'd rather sit
at home alone,

265
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:19,451
and in the dark,
than to hang out with you.

266
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:25,457
Sassy.

267
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,192
I like it.

268
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:31,062
Deal me in,
gentlemen.

269
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:31,963
Oh,

270
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,264
and lady.

271
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:34,899
Buy in's
ten thousand big ones.

272
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:37,135
Oh, right, high stakes.
I like it.

273
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,136
Pig farts!

274
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,671
Crash and burn.

275
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:41,606
Oh, I see, you're one of those.
Right.

276
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:42,941
200.
MAN: I swear,

277
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:46,811
I am gonna stab you in
the eye if you do not stop

278
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,213
dealing me crap!

279
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:49,914
Call.

280
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:50,915
I'm out.

281
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:53,918
Um, ten thousand, all in.

282
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,488
(grunts)
Fold.

283
00:10:58,425 --> 00:11:00,925
What do you know
about God Johnson?

284
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:02,594
I like fire.

285
00:11:02,596 --> 00:11:04,262
Right, never mind.

286
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:05,664
Maybe I can help.

287
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,500
I did see him perform a miracle.
Really?

288
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,437
He scored me an extra
Jell-O at snack time.

289
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:13,772
Shh.

290
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:15,674
Useless.

291
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:17,175
Royal flush.

292
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,777
Cheater!
Red pubic hair!

293
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:19,778
Mm-hmm.

294
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:22,947
DOCTOR:
Billy, what did I tell you

295
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:25,116
about throwing
your underwear?

296
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:26,184
They're not mine.

297
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,452
DOCTOR: Really?
'Cause you're naked.

298
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:30,021
Yes, I'm more of a boxer
briefs guy, but thank you.

299
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,956
Sorry about that.
You must be Lucifer.

300
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,124
I'm Dr. Garrity.

301
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:34,192
Oh.
Yes.

302
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:35,326
Can we talk later?

303
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:37,796
I have to get him to
his electroshock treatment.

304
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:38,797
Really?

305
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,398
Just kidding.
Yes.

306
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,866
You, this way. Come.

307
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,135
Very good.
Let's go find
you some pants.

308
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:47,706
Dad.

309
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:52,410
(sighs)

310
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:03,388
Aha! Of course,
you're the murderer.

311
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:06,157
Right,
suppose I should thwart you now.

312
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,460
Off to jail, cowboy.

313
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:13,064
No, please, I have to save her.

314
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,399
What do you mean, save her?

315
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:19,571
(exhales)

316
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:30,915
(grunts)
(gasps)

317
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:42,293
It really is you.

318
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:47,465
You son of a bitch.

319
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:53,271
Why the hell would you
get yourself committed?

320
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:56,441
I did it to help
the investigation.

321
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,143
Hey.

322
00:12:58,145 --> 00:12:59,410
What do you think?

323
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:00,879
It's a good likeness, isn't it?

324
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:02,080
That's it, I'm pulling the plug.

325
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:03,648
I'm getting you
out of here, now.
No, no, no, no.

326
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,049
You were the one who said
it would be difficult

327
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:06,050
to interview
God Johnson.

328
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:07,886
So, I took
some initiative.

329
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:09,888
I went undercover.

330
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,889
You must admit having an inside
man could be quite effective.

331
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:12,991
So, you're doing this

332
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:14,392
just to help the case?

333
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:16,795
Well, there may also be
some personal issues

334
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:18,229
I'd like to explore
with Mr. Johnson.

335
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:21,065
But yes, the main reason I came
was to prove he's the killer.

336
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:22,433
Is that why you punched him?

337
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:23,835
To force a confession?
(sighs)

338
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:25,904
Not exactly,
but he had it coming.

339
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:28,006
(sighs)
You see, Detective,

340
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:30,975
it turns out, he may actually be
my father after all.

341
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:34,913
You've decided that the lead
suspect in this investigation

342
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:36,765
may be your father?

343
00:13:36,766 --> 00:13:38,616
I know that God Johnson
is not the killer.

344
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:39,918
And you know that because...

345
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,019
Because
another patient

346
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:42,420
was attacked last night

347
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:44,923
and I saw God Johnson heal her.

348
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:47,926
And here's me being
super-duper helpful:

349
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:49,861
before the orderlies

350
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:52,430
took the victim away,
she told me who did attack her.

351
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:53,832
Great. Who is it?

352
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:56,000
Santa Claus.

353
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:58,803
CHLOE:
<i> He's always been...</i>

354
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:00,605
quirky, but now, he's...

355
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:02,473
I-I don't know. I'm-I'm
worried about him.

356
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:04,275
Well, Lucifer certainly is
an interesting case,

357
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:08,446
but I can't really discuss the,
uh, specifics of his diagnosis.

358
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:10,615
Now, is he your, um...

359
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:12,951
uh, fiancé?
I mean, uh, boyfriend?

360
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:14,052
No.
(chuckles)

361
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:15,220
Lucifer's a co-worker.

362
00:14:15,222 --> 00:14:16,387
Good, good. Well--
(chuckles)

363
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:17,722
I'm sorry.

364
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:19,958
I mean, that's good to know.
That's, um, information,

365
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,627
which is helpful,
'cause it's informative.

366
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:24,295
Right. Yes,
of course, yes.

367
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:25,630
NURSE:
Dr. Garrity?

368
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:26,965
It's time for music therapy.

369
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:27,999
Thank you,
Nurse Kipsy.

370
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:29,701
I should get
going anyhow.

371
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,536
Well, listen, um,
if maybe, uh,

372
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,638
if you want to talk some more,
about Lucifer or, uh,

373
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,741
anything else, uh, feel free,
uh, to give me a call.

374
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:38,243
My cell phone
number's there.

375
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:39,978
Thank you.

376
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,980
Okay.

377
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:45,516
(phone rings)

378
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:47,452
Hey, Maze. What's up?

379
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:02,867
I'll give you one
chance to apologize.

380
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:04,903
Apologize?

381
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,170
You punched me.

382
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:08,406
Tell you
what I can do:

383
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,541
I can forgive you.

384
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:13,745
(laughs) Taking the
high ground, are we?

385
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,013
Magnificent.

386
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,182
Well, I may have struck
the latest blow,

387
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:22,921
but that is only in response to
the litany of offenses that you,

388
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:26,024
dear old Dad, have
bestowed upon me.

389
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:30,528
So you believe me? Good.

390
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,563
Tell me, just what is it
you think I've done?

391
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:34,766
Oh, we're going there, are we?
Right, let's see.

392
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:37,802
Um, casting me into Hell
for eternity

393
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:40,204
because you haven't got the
balls to get your own cowardly

394
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:41,873
hands dirty.

395
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,608
Manipulating me
with the detective,

396
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,143
giving me the illusion
of control.

397
00:15:45,145 --> 00:15:46,611
You are a...

398
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:49,447
patronizing, sinister,

399
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,882
helicopter parent!

400
00:15:50,884 --> 00:15:53,217
So you think
you have no free will.

401
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:56,321
Every bad thing that's happened
throughout eternity

402
00:15:56,323 --> 00:15:59,390
is your doing, not mine!

403
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:00,959
It's all part of "God's Plan."

404
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:02,293
Even Mum's coming here

405
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,495
and manipulation of me
was part of it.

406
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:06,564
Your mother's here?
Oh!

407
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:07,932
Look who cares now.

408
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:09,534
Oh, my.

409
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:13,638
Oh, well, that is something.

410
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:18,509
I still remember
the first moment we met.

411
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:22,914
Mmm. There was nothing,
just darkness and...

412
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:28,019
...then she appeared.
(chuckles softly)

413
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:30,922
It did not take long for us
to light up the universe.

414
00:16:30,924 --> 00:16:34,425
Much as I'm enjoying this trip
down memory lane,

415
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:37,428
I want an apology-- nay.

416
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,664
Nay, I demand penance.

417
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,100
You must atone
for what you've done.

418
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:43,034
(eyes crackle)

419
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:46,004
Now, that's not the Samael
I remember.

420
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,605
No.

421
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:52,377
No, Dad, this is who you made me
when you cast me away!

422
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:53,845
Now apologize!

423
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:54,979
(door opens)

424
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:56,114
LINDA:
Uh, Lucifer?

425
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:02,053
MAZE:
Guy sounds like
he wants to bang.

426
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:03,388
CHLOE (on phone):
He's Lucifer's doctor, Maze.

427
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,389
MAZE:
So what?

428
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:05,790
Doctors don't want to get laid?

429
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:08,292
Does everything always have to
be about sex with you?

430
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:09,460
Yeah.

431
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:10,561
He was just trying
to be helpful.

432
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:13,231
We should invite him
on the booze cruise.

433
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:14,332
What booze cruise?

434
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:16,200
Tonight.
I had a friend set up a yacht.

435
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,202
You know,
it'll be like a hip-hop video.

436
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,371
You said you wanted to expand
our circle of friends.

437
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,040
That's not what I meant at all.

438
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:24,075
Oh.

439
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:26,644
You want to ride solo
with Dr. McHotty.

440
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:28,413
I can get behind that.

441
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:30,148
Or on top, dealer's choice.

442
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,682
(laughs) I'm kidding.

443
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:33,084
Okay, I'll set it all up.

444
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:36,687
You won't have to lift a finger.
Let me help you.

445
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:38,556
I don't want, nor need,
your help

446
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,091
with setting up a date.
I'm good.

447
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:42,077
Why not?

448
00:17:42,078 --> 00:17:44,062
You and I are flowing, Chlo.
Same page.

449
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:46,497
Nope.
Different books altogether.

450
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:49,667
You crack me up, Decker.

451
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:52,937
("If God Was One of Us" playing)

452
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:58,609
ELLA (singing along):
♪ What if God was one of us? ♪

453
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:04,182
♪ Just a slob like one of us ♪

454
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:06,017
♪ Just a stra-- ♪

455
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:08,853
Oh, my God, Chloe,
this song is so good.

456
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:11,856
Yeah, yeah. People seemed
to really like it...

457
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:12,857
in 1995.

458
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:14,459
Oh, my God, and
the music video.

459
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:16,227
Uh...
Oh.
(music stops)

460
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:17,195
What's going on?

461
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:18,896
So, um, by chance,

462
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:21,699
have you found
any evidence

463
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:24,368
pointing to, um...

464
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,721
Santa Claus?

465
00:18:26,722 --> 00:18:29,073
I was gonna ask you
the exact same thing.

466
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:30,074
Really?
Yes.

467
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:32,710
Long white hair.

468
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:33,978
Found it on the
victim's clothes.

469
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,781
Wasn't sure what it was, but
yeah, totally screams Santa.

470
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:39,550
I'll have it
tested ASAP.

471
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:41,285
I could see if
you're mentally troubled,

472
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:44,222
you see someone with long
white hair commit a crime,

473
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:45,756
you could call him
Santa Claus.

474
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:47,158
Right?
(pages turning)

475
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:50,828
Kind of like this guy.

476
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:53,798
ELLA:
Uh, yeah.

477
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,933
Dude looks exactly like
the creepy drunk Santa

478
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:57,401
at the mall when
I was a kid.

479
00:18:57,403 --> 00:19:01,005
Too bad setting up an interview
would take forever...

480
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:03,241
without a doctor's permission.

481
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:05,109
Ooh.

482
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:07,211
A doctor's permission...

483
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:10,448
Yeah?

484
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,750
Hey, Maze.

485
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:14,519
You still want to help me?

486
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:15,753
(Linda exhales sharply)

487
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:17,788
Okay, so that was "God" God
back there?

488
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,190
As in capital "G"?

489
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:20,758
I didn't bow.
I should have bowed.

490
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,260
You should have spit
in His face.

491
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:23,427
Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.

492
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:24,595
Then you're no use to me,
Doctor.

493
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:25,762
What on earth
are you doing here anyway?

494
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:28,032
Chloe sent me to check on you
because she was worried.

495
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:29,200
(sighs)
But now, I'm worried.

496
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:30,701
Please tell me
you're not still planning on

497
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:32,670
having your mom and God
destroy each other.

498
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,672
Don't be silly.
That plan won't work anymore.

499
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,641
Oh. Oh, good.
Maybe I should've curtsied.

500
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:38,176
Unfortunately,
Dad seems to be soft on Mum.

501
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:40,111
Like he still has feelings
for her.

502
00:19:40,113 --> 00:19:43,447
(gasps) Which gives me
another way to punish them,

503
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:45,616
far more tortuous than death.

504
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:46,617
And we're back to "not good."

505
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:47,818
No, no, no, no, this is better.

506
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:51,189
And you, my dear doctor,
are going to help me. (laughs)

507
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:00,231
LUCIFER: Okay,
you've all been chosen

508
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:02,500
to help with
a very special mission called

509
00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:04,936
"Operation Help Lucifer
Escape from the Hospital."

510
00:20:04,938 --> 00:20:07,104
Mm, that's a little
on the nose, son.

511
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:09,407
You are literally the judgiest
person in the universe.

512
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:10,575
You know that, Dad?

513
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:11,809
PETE:
Escape?

514
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:12,944
But we get pudding here.

515
00:20:12,946 --> 00:20:15,313
Oh, look,
I know the puddings are good,

516
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:17,748
but there must be more
that you all desire.

517
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,950
I mean, come on, Pete.

518
00:20:18,952 --> 00:20:20,284
I know desserts
aren't the only thing

519
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:22,086
that tickle your fancy,
are they? Hmm?

520
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:24,422
I do want to watch it all burn.

521
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:25,840
Right.

522
00:20:25,841 --> 00:20:27,257
(lighter flicks open)
Then fire away.

523
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,593
Oh...

524
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:29,694
Go, go, go, go, go.

525
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:30,928
Right.

526
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,531
I want to turn the lights on...
and off.

527
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:34,599
Good! Go!

528
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:35,600
I love a good rave.

00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:37,013
Who's next?

530
00:20:37,014 --> 00:20:38,425
I want to throw
underwear at heads.

531
00:20:38,426 --> 00:20:39,837
Laundry room! Right?
Go forth, people. Come on.

532
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,305
Liberate yourselves.

533
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:43,007
Play to your strengths.

534
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:45,142
So this is your big plan
for busting us out of here.

535
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:48,112
Encouraging a man
to steal underwear?

536
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:49,780
No, no. That was just for fun.

538

00:22:38,124 --> 00:22:40,725
Okay, Maze,
this is an interrogation

568
00:22:40,727 --> 00:22:42,226
disguised as a casual dinner.

569
00:22:42,228 --> 00:22:43,561
There's no need
to get dolled up.

570
00:22:43,563 --> 00:22:46,063
Please don't tell me you made
reservations at somewhere fancy.

00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:48,232
Opposite of fancy.

00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:49,734
It's here.

573
00:22:49,736 --> 00:22:52,002
Here. Why?

574
00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:53,904
Well, duh, your bedroom's here.

575
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:55,272
Where else
are we gonna have sex?

576
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:58,843
(sighs) For the last time, Maze,
we're not having a threesome.

577
00:22:58,845 --> 00:23:00,411
I'm okay to watch.

00:24:21,594 --> 00:24:25,196
Okay, but how is having them
fall in love again revenge?

00:24:25,198 --> 00:24:27,865
Oh, trust me, Doctor, after
a brief re-honeymoon period,

Try to remember that
each one of them is a person.

677
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:55,472
Yeah. I, uh, I saw this older
gentleman the other day.

678
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:58,442
Uh, long white hair.
White beard.

679
00:27:58,444 --> 00:27:59,977
He reminded me of
my crazy Uncle Al.

680
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:02,046
You must be talking about Dale.
Yeah, what's his deal?

681
00:28:02,048 --> 00:28:04,615
Is he one of the violent ones?

682
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:07,785
Um...

683
00:28:07,787 --> 00:28:10,254
Uh...

684
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:12,722
Um, what kind of civil servant
are you, exactly?

685
00:28:12,725 --> 00:28:14,491
(phone chimes)

686
00:28:15,828 --> 00:28:19,763
Wow. Well, this evening
just got even more interesting.

687
00:28:19,765 --> 00:28:22,299
Apparently, your co-worker,
Lucifer, just escaped

688
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:25,235
and took God Johnson with him.

689
00:28:32,078 --> 00:28:33,944
What's he doing here, Lucifer?

690
00:28:33,946 --> 00:28:35,746
I don't know. You married him.

691
00:28:35,748 --> 00:28:38,182
Well, it kind of ruins our plans
to storm the Gates of Heaven

692
00:28:38,184 --> 00:28:39,750
and destroy him.

693
00:28:39,752 --> 00:28:42,019
Well, I'm thinking we might
not need to do that anymore.

694
00:28:42,021 --> 00:28:45,189
I will never forgive him, if
that's what you're getting at.

695
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:46,523
The point is, Mum,

696
00:28:46,525 --> 00:28:51,095
that I think Dad...
sincerely misses you.

Look at you.

700
00:28:57,436 --> 00:29:00,270
An absolute vision.

701
00:29:00,272 --> 00:29:01,972

00:29:05,044 --> 00:29:06,877
I'm just gonna... Doctor.

705
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:10,114
For the life of me, I can't even
remember why we were fighting.

706
00:29:10,116 --> 00:29:12,116
The flames? Eternal damnation?

707
00:29:12,118 --> 00:29:13,784
The... Kind of hard to forget.

708
00:29:13,786 --> 00:29:17,154
JOHNSON: I am so sorry
that you suffered.

709
00:29:17,156 --> 00:29:20,290
Well, I su... suppose
I should apologize

710
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:22,893
for trying to destroy
your precious toy

711
00:29:22,895 --> 00:29:26,396
with floods and
with plagues and whatnot.

712
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:29,299
I guess humanity
isn't entirely awful.

713
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:31,735
They did make vodka.

714
00:29:31,737 --> 00:29:33,137
Roller coasters.

715
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:34,705
Triple crème Brie.

716
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:38,375
You hear about dancing?

717
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:41,411
Yes, I actually did some of that
on a table, once.

718
00:29:41,413 --> 00:29:44,882
("Can't Take My Eyes
Off Of You" begins playing)

719
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,820

This.

729
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:29,026
I didn't think
this was possible.

730
00:30:29,028 --> 00:30:30,894
It wasn't part of the plan.

731
00:30:30,896 --> 00:30:33,263
So, maybe...

732
00:30:33,265 --> 00:30:36,266
maybe we make a new plan.

733
00:30:36,268 --> 00:30:38,669

First you check yourself

00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:10,467
into a mental hospital,

750
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:13,503
only to kidnap another
patient and escape.

751
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:15,739
Lucifer, how is that helping?

752
00:31:15,741 --> 00:31:18,342
Well, i-if you must know,

753
00:31:18,344 --> 00:31:20,611
God Johnson is
indeed my father,

754
00:31:20,613 --> 00:31:23,247
and, uh, I needed to do
a little matchmaking.

755
00:31:23,249 --> 00:31:24,815
(sighs)

756
00:31:24,817 --> 00:31:26,917
With him and
Charlotte Richards?

757
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:29,586
I mean, I'm scared to know
how she ties into all this.

758
00:31:29,588 --> 00:31:32,155
Well, never mind that.
What about our killer?

759
00:31:32,157 --> 00:31:34,524
Hmm? Did you find
proof of Santa Claus?

760
00:31:34,526 --> 00:31:35,759
Time for your meds.

761
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:37,094
Ooh, lovely.

762
00:31:37,096 --> 00:31:39,630
Thank you. Right.

763
00:31:39,632 --> 00:31:41,632
Unexpected perk of the place.
(chuckles)

764
00:31:41,634 --> 00:31:42,766
Maybe it's a good thing

765
00:31:42,768 --> 00:31:45,168
there's another day
on your 72-hour hold. You know?

766
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:48,438
Maybe being here is the best
thing for you right now.

767
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,840
Okay.

768
00:31:55,381 --> 00:31:57,881
(knocking on door)

769
00:31:57,883 --> 00:31:59,116
Hey.

770
00:31:59,118 --> 00:32:01,451
I just wanted to say

771
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:03,787
that I'm sorry I lied.

772
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:07,391
I, um...

773
00:32:07,393 --> 00:32:09,293
Sometimes with work,

774
00:32:09,295 --> 00:32:10,661
I get shortsighted.

775
00:32:10,663 --> 00:32:12,996
And I never wanted to...

776
00:32:12,998 --> 00:32:14,031
Use me?

777
00:32:16,035 --> 00:32:18,035
(quietly):
Yeah.

778
00:32:19,738 --> 00:32:22,472
If you had just been
up-front with me,

779
00:32:22,474 --> 00:32:25,475
I would've told you that Dale,
the guy you were asking about,

780
00:32:25,477 --> 00:32:26,843
he's been here for 15 years.

781
00:32:26,845 --> 00:32:31,548
Yeah, he can seem a bit prickly,
but he's a teddy bear.

782
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,483
He's got no
violent tendencies.

783
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:35,886
There is just no way
he'd kill someone.

784
00:32:35,888 --> 00:32:38,973
All right.

785
00:32:38,974 --> 00:32:42,059
Legally, I can't let you
look at Dale's medical file.

786
00:32:42,061 --> 00:32:44,661
But, um...

787
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:47,664
what happens
when I turn away is, um,

788
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:48,832
out of my hands.

789
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:51,335
Thank you.

790
00:32:51,337 --> 00:32:53,537
(quietly): Yeah.

791
00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:57,774
Ooh, look, a Nigerian prince
needs my help.

792
00:32:57,776 --> 00:32:59,776
Wow.

793
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:01,578
Thanks.

794
00:33:06,018 --> 00:33:07,651
Santa Claus?

795
00:33:08,854 --> 00:33:10,020
Okay, so what's the big deal?

796
00:33:10,022 --> 00:33:11,355
Someone dresses up
as Santa every year.

797
00:33:11,357 --> 00:33:12,523
Patients love it.

798
00:33:12,524 --> 00:33:13,690
Yeah, well, that someone
could be the killer.

799
00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:14,791
But a different person
does it every year.

800
00:33:14,793 --> 00:33:16,760
Even I did it a
few years back.

801
00:33:16,762 --> 00:33:19,930
Okay, we store the,
uh, costume in here.

802
00:33:22,368 --> 00:33:24,301
Wait, wait, wait.

803
00:33:24,303 --> 00:33:26,003
(clears throat)

804
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:35,545
Where's the beard?
The red hat?

805
00:33:35,547 --> 00:33:37,481
It should be in there.
Okay, two things.

806
00:33:37,483 --> 00:33:40,884
Who else has a key
to that cabinet? And...

807
00:33:40,886 --> 00:33:42,986
...I need you
to put these on.

808
00:33:42,988 --> 00:33:45,055
Ooh, ooh.

809
00:33:45,057 --> 00:33:48,225
These drugs are a bit different,
aren't they?

810
00:33:48,227 --> 00:33:51,395
'Cause I can't feel my tongue.

811
00:33:51,397 --> 00:33:54,498
Oh. Hello, pretty kitty,

812
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,334
kitty, kitty, kitty...

813
00:33:57,336 --> 00:34:00,737
Santa, you're here as well?

814
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:03,407
Oh, I'm afraid
I've been a naughty boy.

815
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:04,574
(grunts)

816
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:11,248
LUCIFER:
You may want to rethink this.

817
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,650
You see,
I am actually the Devil.

818
00:34:13,652 --> 00:34:15,585
(distorted):
No, you're not the Devil.

819
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:18,255
You're just a man who's
delusional in a mental hospital.

820
00:34:18,257 --> 00:34:20,090
You made it all up.

821
00:34:20,092 --> 00:34:21,358
So...

822
00:34:22,194 --> 00:34:24,027
...I'm not the Devil.

823
00:34:24,029 --> 00:34:26,930
I'm just a man who's delusional.

824
00:34:26,932 --> 00:34:27,998
I made it all up.

825
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,467
I made it all up!

826
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:34,938
I made it all up.
(chuckles)

827
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,441
Hello, son.

828
00:34:37,443 --> 00:34:38,442
Dad!

829
00:34:38,444 --> 00:34:41,445
See? I am the Devil.

830
00:34:41,447 --> 00:34:42,946
Nice try, Santa.

831
00:34:42,948 --> 00:34:44,614
(chuckles)

832
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:46,783
Tell me what you told
the police.
Only the truth.

833
00:34:46,785 --> 00:34:51,021
That you, Mr. Kringle,
are a cold-blooded killer.

834
00:34:51,023 --> 00:34:51,955
What else?

835
00:34:51,957 --> 00:34:53,557
What do you want to know,
Nurse Kipsy?

836
00:35:03,335 --> 00:35:05,135
Why aren't the drugs
working on you?

837
00:35:05,137 --> 00:35:06,470
Well, it's obvious, isn't it?

838
00:35:06,472 --> 00:35:07,704
It's because he's God!

839
00:35:08,907 --> 00:35:10,240
LUCIFER:
Uh, oh.

840
00:35:10,242 --> 00:35:11,575
Hey.

841
00:35:11,577 --> 00:35:13,143
Hey, they shouldn't be working

842
00:35:13,145 --> 00:35:15,011
on me, either, but...

843
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:16,413
Is the detective still here?

844
00:35:16,415 --> 00:35:18,482
That might explain it.
Shut up.

845
00:35:18,484 --> 00:35:20,050
Okay.
KIPSY:
Doesn't matter.

846
00:35:20,052 --> 00:35:22,719
Now you know it's me,
I have to kill you both.

847
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:25,322
(sighs)

848
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,992
What's that for?

849
00:35:28,994 --> 00:35:30,427
A long shot.

850
00:35:39,171 --> 00:35:40,904
Okay.

851
00:35:40,906 --> 00:35:42,839
(camera clicks)

852
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:45,075
That's got to be the coolest
thing I've ever seen.

853
00:35:45,077 --> 00:35:47,744
I'd-I'd applaud, you know,
if I weren't cuffed.

854
00:35:47,746 --> 00:35:49,746
Sorry about that.
It's just a precaution.

855
00:35:49,748 --> 00:35:51,281
Hey, I get it.
(cell phone beeps)

856
00:35:51,283 --> 00:35:53,016
Bingo.
Wow.

857
00:35:53,018 --> 00:35:54,084
That was fast.

858
00:35:54,086 --> 00:35:55,118
Yeah, you don't know Ella.

859
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,954
The print belongs
to one Patricia Hightower.

860
00:35:57,956 --> 00:35:59,689
We have a patient
named Sue Hightower,

861
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:01,224
the one God Johnson attacked.

862
00:36:01,226 --> 00:36:04,361
Okay. I'm waiting
on a DMV photo.

863
00:36:04,363 --> 00:36:05,562
(cell phone beeps)

864
00:36:05,564 --> 00:36:06,930
She looks familiar.

865
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,533
That's Nurse Kipsy.

866
00:36:09,535 --> 00:36:11,301
KIPSY:
<i> I changed my name</i>

867
00:36:11,303 --> 00:36:13,003
so no one would know
she's my mother.

868
00:36:15,207 --> 00:36:19,776
She was a raging bitch
my entire life.

869
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:23,980
Controlling,
manipulative...

870
00:36:23,982 --> 00:36:25,782
She tortured me.

871
00:36:26,618 --> 00:36:29,886
So I decided to torture her.

872
00:36:29,888 --> 00:36:31,454
Pumped her full of drugs,
drove her crazy.

873
00:36:31,456 --> 00:36:33,456
Preaching to the choir, sister.

874
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:34,925
Evil parents

875
00:36:34,927 --> 00:36:36,159
deserve to be punished.

876
00:36:36,161 --> 00:36:39,129
You had every right
to destroy her.

877
00:36:40,265 --> 00:36:41,464
But what about the orderly?

878
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:43,466
He found out what I was doing.

879
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:45,235
He... said he was
gonna turn me in.

880
00:36:45,237 --> 00:36:46,236
I had no choice.

881
00:36:46,238 --> 00:36:47,938
No, he was innocent

882
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,906
and you killed him,

883
00:36:49,908 --> 00:36:52,409
so I am gonna have
to punish you.

884
00:36:52,411 --> 00:36:54,978
(grunts)

885
00:36:56,081 --> 00:36:58,081
Why aren't I pulverizing you?

886
00:36:58,083 --> 00:37:01,251
Uh, one because you're a nutjob.

887
00:37:01,253 --> 00:37:02,586
And two,

888
00:37:02,588 --> 00:37:04,521
because I switched out
your normal meds

889
00:37:04,523 --> 00:37:06,489
with a massive dose of Haldol.

890
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:07,824
(chuckles)

891
00:37:07,826 --> 00:37:09,593
You know...

892
00:37:10,495 --> 00:37:11,628
...they don't normally

893
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:13,430
let patients wear belts.

894
00:37:13,432 --> 00:37:15,665
Suicide risk.

895
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:19,102
So, thank you for getting a
special dispensation for yours

896
00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:21,304
because now I got it.

897
00:37:21,306 --> 00:37:23,106
God is gonna kill Lucifer,

898
00:37:23,108 --> 00:37:24,608
then hang himself.

899
00:37:25,444 --> 00:37:26,776
(chuckles)

900
00:37:26,778 --> 00:37:29,646
Kind of poetic, don't you think?

901
00:37:29,648 --> 00:37:31,615
Gonna go find a ladder.

902
00:37:31,617 --> 00:37:33,650
Oh, a ladder.
(chuckles)

903
00:37:33,652 --> 00:37:34,784
JOHNSON:
Now, I had no idea

904
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:37,187
you were so angry with me.

905
00:37:37,189 --> 00:37:38,888
Really?

906
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:42,325
'Cause I... I've been
pretty up-front about it.

907
00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:44,394
But to want to destroy me?

908
00:37:44,396 --> 00:37:46,630
That's pretty serious.

909
00:37:46,632 --> 00:37:48,865
You mind telling me why?

910
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:52,002
Because...

911
00:37:52,004 --> 00:37:54,738
because I'm your son.

912
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:57,040
And...

913
00:37:59,044 --> 00:38:00,744
...you rejected me.

914
00:38:01,747 --> 00:38:03,613
Oh.

915
00:38:05,017 --> 00:38:07,684
Well, then I guess
I can't say as I blame you.

916
00:38:07,686 --> 00:38:09,552
Fact of the matter is,

917
00:38:09,554 --> 00:38:10,854
I don't even remember why

918
00:38:10,856 --> 00:38:12,622
I was ever so angry with you
to begin with.

919
00:38:15,694 --> 00:38:19,029
For what it's worth...

920
00:38:19,031 --> 00:38:21,865
I am sorry.

921
00:38:21,867 --> 00:38:24,334
I truly am.

922
00:38:24,336 --> 00:38:27,704
And I am proud of you, Samael.

923
00:38:27,706 --> 00:38:29,906
I am proud of the man
you've become.

924
00:38:33,045 --> 00:38:34,577
So, what do you say...

925
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:36,179
Wait, no.

926
00:38:36,181 --> 00:38:37,347
Not... not my belt.

927
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:38,514
You can't take my belt.
It's mine.

928
00:38:38,517 --> 00:38:40,450
Patricia Hightower, LAPD.
Don't move.

929
00:38:40,452 --> 00:38:42,719
(belt clatters on floor)

930
00:38:42,721 --> 00:38:45,889
Detective.
(whoops)

931
00:38:45,891 --> 00:38:47,357
You okay?

932
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:48,692
Honestly...

933
00:38:48,694 --> 00:38:50,960
I've never felt better.

934
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:54,030
(grunts)

935
00:38:54,032 --> 00:38:57,033
What this?
What-What just happened?

936
00:38:57,035 --> 00:38:59,936
What are you talking about?
We just beat Santa.

937
00:39:01,073 --> 00:39:02,372
Who are you?

938
00:39:02,374 --> 00:39:03,473
It's me, Dad.

939
00:39:03,475 --> 00:39:05,141
Lucifer.

940
00:39:05,143 --> 00:39:07,143
Does someone want to tell me
what the hell is going on?

941
00:39:07,145 --> 00:39:09,646
Get me out of
these damn things.

942
00:39:19,091 --> 00:39:20,957
"The piece is here."

943
00:39:28,834 --> 00:39:30,100
(scoffs)

944
00:39:30,102 --> 00:39:32,168
Well, what do you know.

945
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,837
It fits perfectly.

946
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,706
Yes, I think this is what Uriel
was trying to tell me.

947
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:39,642
Just before he died,

948
00:39:39,644 --> 00:39:42,178
he whispered in my ear,
"The piece is here."

949
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,581
I mean, I thought it
was nonsense, but...

950
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:46,416
this must be why
the sword wasn't working.

951
00:39:46,418 --> 00:39:47,650
It wasn't complete.

952
00:39:47,652 --> 00:39:49,419
Dad supposedly destroyed
the Flaming Sword

953
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:50,453
after the rebellion.

954
00:39:50,455 --> 00:39:51,988
So, are you saying

955
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:54,257
he just broke it into two
pieces? Azrael's blade...

956
00:39:54,259 --> 00:39:56,209
And this.

957
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:58,160
Yes, which somehow
ended up on Earth.

958
00:39:58,163 --> 00:39:59,863
Its power probably awakened

959
00:39:59,865 --> 00:40:03,333
when Azrael's blade
ended up here, too.

960
00:40:03,335 --> 00:40:05,869
Which is when Mr. Johnson
must've stumbled upon it.

961
00:40:05,871 --> 00:40:07,103
But why did he think
he was father?

962
00:40:07,105 --> 00:40:11,107
Well, I mean, Azrael's blade
inspired death.

963
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:14,778
Maybe this piece
activated the opposite-- life.

964
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,546
Healing. Gave him the power

965
00:40:16,548 --> 00:40:18,014
and knowledge of the divine.

966
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:20,850
And when he found out that he
could heal like that, he...

967
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:22,285
he thought he was God.

968
00:40:22,287 --> 00:40:23,686
What's more
important is that

969
00:40:23,688 --> 00:40:26,956
now the sword's complete,
we can get on with our plan.

970
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:29,292
So... the...

971
00:40:29,294 --> 00:40:31,127
(sighs)

972
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:33,797
Or not.

973
00:40:38,537 --> 00:40:40,303
Maybe there's
another piece missing.

974
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:42,472
Or maybe a dragon
has to breathe on it.

975
00:40:42,474 --> 00:40:44,307
Who knows?

976
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:45,642
Well, maybe Mum does.

977
00:40:45,644 --> 00:40:47,477
Did...

978
00:40:47,479 --> 00:40:49,312
Where is she, anyway?

979
00:40:49,314 --> 00:40:51,748
<i> (knock on door)</i>

980
00:40:57,689 --> 00:40:59,055
I thought I made
myself clear.

981
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:01,758
I kissed a man today.

982
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,393
What's your deal?

983
00:41:03,395 --> 00:41:05,728
I thought he was my ex-husband.

984
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,997
When I kissed him,

985
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:10,934
I realized it wasn't him.

986
00:41:10,936 --> 00:41:13,036
And the strangest part is,

987
00:41:13,038 --> 00:41:15,905
I don't know what's
more upsetting...

988
00:41:15,907 --> 00:41:18,775
that it wasn't him?
(chuckles)

989
00:41:21,046 --> 00:41:24,214
Or that I... I wished it was.

990
00:41:24,216 --> 00:41:25,748
Wow.

991
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,951
I just don't want to be alone.

992
00:41:27,953 --> 00:41:31,688
Could we just
hold each other?

993
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:35,258
Please?

994
00:41:39,064 --> 00:41:41,130
With your pants off, of course.

995
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:52,208
I still can't believe
I gave all my money away.

996
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:53,576
Well, if it's
any consolation,

997
00:41:53,578 --> 00:41:56,946
you haven't exactly
been yourself of late.
Yeah.

998
00:41:56,948 --> 00:41:58,715
Listen, I wanted to ask you...

999
00:41:58,717 --> 00:42:00,650
what's the last thing
you remember?

1000
00:42:00,652 --> 00:42:03,253
I was in New Mexico for work,

1001
00:42:03,255 --> 00:42:05,622
I was walking through
this Navajo gift shop.

1002
00:42:05,624 --> 00:42:09,392
I saw a cool belt buckle,
so I picked it up, and...

1003
00:42:09,394 --> 00:42:10,727
next thing I knew, I woke up

1004
00:42:10,729 --> 00:42:12,295
strapped to a gurney
next to you.

1005
00:42:12,297 --> 00:42:14,264
Lucky you.
Yeah.

1006
00:42:14,266 --> 00:42:15,899
Hey, they, uh,

1007
00:42:15,901 --> 00:42:17,166
they say we was arguing.

1008
00:42:17,168 --> 00:42:20,670
If I did or said something
to upset you, I apologize.

1009
00:42:20,672 --> 00:42:25,241
No, no, you were quite
lovely actually.

1010
00:42:25,243 --> 00:42:28,678
For a brief moment,
I thought you were my father.

1011
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,764
(chuckles)

1012
00:42:30,765 --> 00:42:32,849
A man for whom I harbor
a great deal of resentment.

1013
00:42:32,851 --> 00:42:34,450
And you said some things

1014
00:42:34,452 --> 00:42:38,321
that I think I wish
he'd always said to me,

1015
00:42:38,323 --> 00:42:40,957
so for that I thank you.

1016
00:42:40,959 --> 00:42:43,793
Well, I guess even
a blind squirrel

1017
00:42:43,795 --> 00:42:45,328
catches a nut
every now and then.

1018
00:42:46,598 --> 00:42:47,497
You take care of yourself.

1019
00:42:50,502 --> 00:42:52,835
Hey, does this mean you're not
angry at your dad anymore?

1020
00:42:52,837 --> 00:42:55,271
No, I'm not angry.

1021
00:42:55,273 --> 00:42:57,173
I'm bloody furious.

1022
00:42:58,443 --> 00:42:59,642
'Cause I realized that my father

1023
00:42:59,644 --> 00:43:02,312
would never say those things
to me.

1024
00:43:02,314 --> 00:43:04,347
And for that...

1025
00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:07,183
I hate him all the more.
