182
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,973
You can't be suggesting...

183
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,575
That you slept
with her? I'm not.

184
00:07:56,577 --> 00:07:57,876
No. That I'm a two-pump chump.

185
00:07:57,878 --> 00:07:59,744
If we'd slept together,
she wouldn't have left

186
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:02,747
until the morning.
Believe me.

187
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:04,883
Maybe she'd still be alive.

188
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:06,885
Okay, what else
can you tell me about Jana?

189
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:08,987
I need to put together
a victim profile.

190
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,289
Well, I mean,
she gave incredible...

191
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,625
And I'm not talking
about her sexual skills.

192
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:15,427
Right.
Maybe her last name,

193
00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:17,863
friends, family, where she was
staying when she was in L.A.?

194
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:19,498
I'm a lover, not a Rolodex.

195
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,899
OFFICER:
Detective.

196
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:22,234
Found it in the tunnel.

197
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:24,202
Thank you.

198
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:26,905
All threatening texts.

199
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:28,640
All sent from the same number.

200
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:31,810
This last one, just before
she got to your place.

201
00:08:31,812 --> 00:08:34,412
"Ditch the loser from Lux"?

202
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:37,282
Oh, this is terrible. She
was seeing someone else at Lux?

203
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:40,385
I think it means you.

204
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:44,990
(laughs)

205
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:46,324
DAN:
<i> The number on Jana's cell</i>

206
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:49,761
belongs to a wealthy Silicon
Valley guy, Andy Kleinberg.

207
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:51,129
We tracked his phone's GPS

208
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:54,399
to some swanky
Malibu beach house.

209
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:58,803
I'll send you
the address, Chloe.

210
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:02,140
What the hell
are you doing here?

211
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:03,875
You see this?

212
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:07,546
We're basically famous.

213
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:08,947
Are you nuts?

214
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:11,983
You brag about what we did
in a police precinct?

215
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:13,785
Dude. Chill.

216
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:15,921
I was coming to get my check.
Yeah.

217
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:16,855
(laughs)

218
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:18,123
And I thought

219
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,425
that we could, uh,
celebrate our righteous kill.

220
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:22,694
(giggles)

221
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:25,030
We didn't kill anyone, okay?

222
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:27,065
We just...

223
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,099
We gave karmic justice
a little nudge.

224
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:31,903
Oh. Is that what we're calling
the Russian mob now?

225
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,506
Shh!
(chuckles)

226
00:09:34,508 --> 00:09:35,974
Come on!

227
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:38,443
Let's grab some vodka,
we'll make it a theme.

228
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:40,712
Maze, we're not having a drink.

229
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:41,846
We shouldn't even
be seen together

230
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:44,316
until all this blows over.
Do you get it?

231
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,422
♪ ♪

232
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:03,935
Trying to blend in?

233
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:07,105
Well, it's not often I get
to break out the linen.

234
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,240
Speaking of style, I've got
to get one of these for Lux.

235
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:12,143
Yeah, that would really
tie the place together.

236
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:13,478
Look, for the last time...
WOMAN: Hey, Lucifer.

237
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,647
Yes. Hello. For the
last time, Detective,

238
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,449
nothing happened
with Jana after you left.

239
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:18,583
I believe you.

240
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:19,884
It just doesn't...
Hey, Lucifer.

241
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:21,453
...change anything.

242
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:22,654
Well, why not?

243
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:25,557
Well, look at this party.

244
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,692
I bet this is your your
definition of fun, isn't it?

245
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:30,495
Well, I mean, I prefer scotch in
a lowball to sex on the beach...

246
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:33,732
and the drink, I mean.
But dealer's choice.

247
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:35,433
Okay, well, fun for me

248
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:37,369
is being home with Trixie,
reading her a book.

249
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:38,503
Really?

250
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:40,472
Yeah.

251
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:43,308
And that's okay,
but we're different.

252
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,209
Like, too different.

253
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:46,444
Well, as a wise man
once said,

254
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:48,013
"opposites attract."

255
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:49,681
I believe that was
an animated cat

256
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:50,749
in a music video.

257
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,051
A<i> wise</i> animated cat.
Excuse me.

258
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:55,620
Hi. I am looking
for Andy Kleinberg.

259
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:56,955
Do you know where he is?

260
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:59,424
Don't waste your time
with him.

261
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:00,876
Let me get you a drink.

262
00:11:00,877 --> 00:11:02,327
LUCIFER:
Keep it in your pants,
Tommy Bahama.

263
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:03,662
She's spoken for,
thank you.

264
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:04,829
(chuckles)
No, I'm not.

265
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,531
So do you know
where Andy is?

266
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:08,900
Your loss.

267
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,537
Oh. Thank you.

268
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:14,005
CHLOE:
Andy Kleinberg?

269
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,740
You're blocking
my view.

270
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:17,909
The view from a jail
cell sucks, too.

271
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:19,244
What, is this a joke?

272
00:11:19,246 --> 00:11:20,945
Wait, is this one
of George's pranks

273
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:23,381
to get me back
for that stripper?

274
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:24,382
Hey, are you a stripper?

275
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:26,551
I'd recommend
you stop talking now.

276
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:28,687
Jana Lawrence was found
murdered this morning.

277
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:31,856
She was my stewardess
on my flight yesterday. So?

278
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,291
So you sent her
a threatening text.

279
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:34,693
"Ditch the loser
from Lux."

280
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:35,694
KLEINEBERG:
Yeah.

281
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:36,728
She said she was hooking up

282
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,430
with some DJ named Lucifer.

283
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:40,899
DJ? How dare you!

284
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:42,233
"Meet me now, or else"?

285
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:46,471
Yeah, or else this is shut off.
<i> No mas.</i>

286
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:47,972
Look, I sent that text

287
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:49,240
to, like, 25 girls last night.

288
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:51,076
It's called a "booty call."
You ever have one?

289
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:53,211
Of course not.
Booties call me.

290
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,412
Sometimes.

291
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:56,014
Look, is there anyone
who can prove

292
00:11:56,016 --> 00:11:57,716
you<i> not</i> having sex?

293
00:11:57,718 --> 00:11:58,817
Oh, I had sex.

294
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:00,051
Meet Sharon.

295
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:02,087
Hey, Lucifer.

296
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:04,022
KLEINBERG:
Oh, yeah.

297
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:05,323
She can attest to
my whereabouts

298
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:06,424
all night long.

299
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:08,226
And she can, too.

300
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,595
Now... (sighs)
if you'll excuse me,

301
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:14,866
I'd like to go somewhere
where you two are not.

302
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:20,305
Charming.
You know...

303
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:22,040
you and him have
a lot in common.

304
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:23,908
We are nothing alike.

305
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,176
Really? Right.

306
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:27,979
LUCIFER: Well, that is
clearly off the rack.

307
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:28,980
Inferior linen.

308
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:30,181
Not remotely the same.

309
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:31,983
Regardless, I don't think
he's our killer.

310
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:34,352
Let's go talk
to your friend Sharon.

311
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:35,787
See if his alibi
checks out.

312
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:38,022
She's not my friend.
She's just a woman that I...

313
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:39,858
No, actually, that's worse.

314
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,159
Right, where to, then?

315
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:42,894
There's been
another murder.

316
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:44,996
Ballistics match
our flight attendant.

317
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:52,036
DAN: The victim was in the
shower when he was killed.

318
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:53,037
Signs of a struggle.

319
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,038
Looks like he was
tortured, too.

320
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,573
So Jana's killer
had it in

321
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:58,343
for this poor chap
as well, did they?

322
00:12:58,345 --> 00:13:00,044
On the upside,
looks like he didn't have

323
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:02,147
anything to do
with this case after all.

324
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:05,416
Pretty sure you didn't
sleep with this guy.

325
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:09,921
Uh, actually, you're
wrong about that, Detective.

326
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:14,592
Raj. So fit.

327
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:17,262
CHLOE:
This isn't good.

328
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:19,063
What, that a man was
one of my lovers?

329
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:21,099
Come now, Detective,
it's the 21st century.

330
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:22,433
It's not that,

331
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:24,335
it's that you slept
with both victims.

332
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:25,937
We've been trying
to find a connection

333
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:27,572
between the two,
and so far

334
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:28,807
all we have is you.

335
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,425
Well, I wish
I could help you.

336
00:13:30,426 --> 00:13:32,042
What, you didn't get details
between the sweet nothings?

337
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:33,077
Quite a few, actually.

338
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:34,946
But they were mostly
about what he desired,

339
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:36,514
which I doubt
you want to hear.

340
00:13:38,385 --> 00:13:40,418
What if this whole thing
is about desire?

341
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,820
You've been with
a lot of people.

342
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:43,154
What if one of them
got jealous

343
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,355
and wanted you
all to themselves?

344
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:45,924
What, you think
one of my exes is

345
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:47,125
killing off the others?

346
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:50,028
Look, I've seen what
your exes are capable of.

347
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,462
Charlotte Richards,
to name one.

348
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:52,997
Bloody hell,
for the last time,

349
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,499
she is not an ex.

350
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,968
Either way,
we should warn them

351
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,102
that they could be
in trouble.

352
00:13:58,104 --> 00:14:00,104
While Dan's looking
into other connections

353
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:01,639
between our victims,
we should talk to

354
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:02,473
anyone you've slept with.

355
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:04,609
Oh, that's
a brilliant plan.

356
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:05,810
It is?

357
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:07,412
Well, what better way
to prove my word to you

358
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:09,280
than a bevy of exes
singing my praises?

359
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:10,548
(chuckles)
Sure.

360
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,983
That's definitely what's
gonna happen.

361
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:13,251
Yeah.
Okay,

362
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:14,953
a list of everyone
you've slept with

363
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:16,821
in the last eight weeks.

364
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:19,390
Right, you'll need
a much bigger notepad.

365
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:21,259

You slept with all of them?

384
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:59,197
Yes. Bit of a dry spell
the last couple of months.

385
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,165
(scoffs)
This is a waste of time.

386
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:03,167
I refuse to believe that
one of my former lovers

387
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:04,168
would kill another.

388
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,737
Yeah, well, so far
we don't have

389
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:06,905
any other connections.

390
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:08,673
And people will go
to crazy lengths

391
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:11,175
for the ones they love,
even if they're the ones

392
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:13,378
who suggested
the split...

393
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,447
and still have feelings,
even though they shouldn't.

394
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:19,350
What on earth are
you talking about?

395
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,886
Did I just say that
out loud?

396
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:25,223
Yes.
Oh. Never mind.

397
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:27,325
Right.

398
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:28,893
(over speaker):
It was an amazing,

399
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:30,895
<i> amazing</i> night.

400
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:32,630
But the next day,
Lucifer was with

401
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:35,800
another woman, so did
that make you jealous?

402
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:37,936
Jealous? Why?

403
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:39,604
Well, because
he basically

404
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,606
used you for sex
and moved on.

405
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,008
Did that bother you?
I knew what I was in for.

406
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,009
And what were you in for?

407
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:47,312
The best night
of my life.

408
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:48,613
The best night of my life.

409
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,315
The best night
of my life.

410
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:51,482
The best night of my life.

411
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:54,218
The best night
of my life.

412
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,386
You know, this is
actually feeling

413
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:57,555
a bit masturbatory,
even for me.

414
00:15:57,557 --> 00:16:00,325
Though clearly not
the words of a killer.

415
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:01,960
He knew exactly
what I wanted.

416
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:03,494
And he did this thing...
(grunts)

417
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:05,196
He did this thing...
(clears throat)

418
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:07,799
He even did this thing
with a Pan flute

419
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,233
and a butternut squash...

420
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:10,935
I was improvising.

421
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:12,270
I didn't have
any zucchinis.

422
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:16,007
He did this thing
with my Tibetan singing pot

423
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:18,009
and artisan honey.

424
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:19,210
It's a game
I play called,

425
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:21,245
"Do I make you
horny, honey?"

426
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,480
...with some Vaseline
and a car battery.

427
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,315
What?
That was a move
I call,

428
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,616
"Gentlemen,
start your engines."

429
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:27,685
It's bloody brilliant.
(chuckles)

430
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:31,556
Did you and Lucifer have
any intimate moments?

431
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:33,958
Obviously, we were intimate.

432
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,360
We were<i> hella</i> intimate.
Mm!

433
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:37,161
Did you not hear about
the honey? I mean...

434
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,496
(clears throat,
voice cracks)

435
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:43,001
We're talking about, um,
emotional intimacy.

436
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:44,535
Like, um...

437
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:48,506
did Lucifer, uh,
bring you dinner?

438
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:51,142
Or did he

439
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:53,544
do anything special
for you?

440
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:55,913
Get you a burger,
fries?

441
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:57,181
(laughs)
What? No.

442
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,417
Look, it was a rad night.

443
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:00,685
...and morning...

444
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:01,486
...and afternoon...

445
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:05,056
But...
that's all.

446
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:06,324
Mm.

447
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:08,760
I mean, I certainly wouldn't
hurt anyone over him.

448
00:17:08,762 --> 00:17:11,262
What? No.

449
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:12,597
There was no reason
to hurt anyone.

450
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,332
I mean, he was just
a meaningless

451
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:16,701
one-night-stand.
CHLOE: Mm.

452
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,436
It was just about sex.
It's just sex.

453
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:19,437
It's just sex.

454
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,173
There was no emotional
connection.

455
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,508
WOMAN: That was it,
it was fun,

456
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,209
but completely meaningless.

457
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,344
Just fun...
...but meaningless.

458
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:28,880
Meaningless.
It meant nothing. Nada.

459
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,181
I never saw him again.

460
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:31,883
See where I'm going
with this?

461
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:38,856
Well, look, man,
the good news is...

462
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:40,491
none of them has motive
to be the killer.

463
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:44,162
Yes. Because none of them
cared enough about me

464
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:46,097
to murder.

465
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:47,331
WOMAN:
Thanks for calling me in.

466
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:50,401
I actually wanted
to speak with you.

467
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:54,339
Wait a minute,
why is she here?

468
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,607
I don't know. I keep telling
the detective she's not my ex.

469
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:58,843
MOM:
I wanted to tell you that

470
00:17:58,845 --> 00:18:00,078
you impressed me

471
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,245
Really?

472
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,980
Yeah.
Mm.

473
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:05,116
I underestimated you.

474
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:07,385
I gave you all
the reason in the world

475
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:08,820
to betray Lucifer.

476
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:10,455
You did.
During that case

477
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:11,756
you went to
incredible lengths

478
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:12,857
to hurt Lucifer.

479
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:13,925
I did nothing
of the sort.

480
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:16,461
You took that case
just to try and get me

481
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:18,229
to call Lucifer
a liar in court.

482
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:20,932
True, but I would never
hurt Lucifer.

483
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:23,134
I was trying to prove

484
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:24,902
that you weren't worthy
of him.

485
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:27,538
I see. What about
the other women

486
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,240
that you don't think
are worthy of him?

487
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:30,374
What'd you do to them?

488
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:32,844
(chuckles) Nothing.

489
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:35,012
They are inconsequential.

490
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:37,248
You're different.

491
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,584
He's different
when he's with you.

492
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:44,088
Does that threaten you?

493
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:47,258
Perhaps at first.

494
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,693
Not anymore.

495
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:51,095
It makes me happy.

496
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:52,697
I'm glad he found someone.

497
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:56,267
He deserves a woman
like you in his life.

498
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:03,274
Have you slept
with him yet?

499
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:04,609
What?

500
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:06,511
See?

501
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:07,545
You're different.

502
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:10,281
Where were you the night
of the 27th?

503
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:11,482
(exhales)

504
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,152
Hey, listen, man,
you're not gonna, uh...

505
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:15,286
You're not gonna
tell Chloe about

506
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:16,354
me and Charlotte,
right?

507
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:18,055
Well, as long as
you promise to never

508
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:19,624
touch Charlotte again.

509
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:20,825
No, it's not a problem.

510
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:24,595
Good. 'Cause the last thing
I need is a step-Dan.

511
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,000
You say some really
weird things, man.

512
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,476
You ever do something
awesome for somebody,

513
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:40,545
and they just don't care?

514
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:42,580
I'm a therapist.

515
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:45,583
Being taken for granted
is in the job description.

516
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:48,085
Hmm.
Like, for example,
when a friend

517
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:50,188
uses your lunch break
for free therapy,

518
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,989
and doesn't say thank you.

519
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:55,059
You want me to take care
of this friend of yours?

520
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:58,329
Yea... It's fine.

521
00:19:58,331 --> 00:19:59,597
So how do you deal with it?

522
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:02,600
I just realize that
self-worth comes from within.

523
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:04,101
You can't rely
on others

524
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:05,836
to validate you.

525
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:07,271
I don't care what
anyone thinks of me.

526
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:08,773
Of course you do,
we all do.

527
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:11,008
You know, and that's okay.

528
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,210
That's human.

529
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,745
I'm a demon.

530
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:16,147
I actually think
you're more human

531
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:17,915
than a lot of people I know.

532
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:19,884
Take that back.

533
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:22,253
Okay, okay,
you're a good friend

534
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:24,655
and a great pers...

535
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:25,623
Demon.

536
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:28,492
You just need to
realize it for yourself.

537
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:31,229
Not because I said it.

538
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:32,763
(minor gasp)

539
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:35,166
You're saying I'm awesome.

540
00:20:35,168 --> 00:20:39,270
I'm saying that<i> you</i> need
to say that you're awesome.

541
00:20:39,272 --> 00:20:42,940
Believe that
you're awesome.

542
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,113
Yes, you're awesome.

543
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:50,514
Hell yeah I am.

544
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:52,850
Thanks, Doc.

545
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:55,053
(door opens)

546
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:56,120
CHLOE:
<i> Do you notice anything</i>

547
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:57,655
out of the ordinary?

548
00:20:57,657 --> 00:20:59,123
Did anyone threaten you?

549
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,858
I mean, there was
that one girl.

550
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,892
What girl?

551
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:03,261
The creepy weirdo.

552
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:05,263
She was always in a
corner of the club.

553
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:07,231
She just gave
this death stare.

554
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:08,399
Daggers.

555
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:10,768
Okay, can you
give me a description?

556
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,436
Well, I can describe
her aura.

557
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:16,140
That's okay.

558
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:18,276
Her name is Suki Price.

559
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,411
A number of your exes confirmed
seeing her lurking around Lux,

560
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:22,780
so we ran her description
through the DMV.

561
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,515
Are you sure you
don't recognize her?

562
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:26,284
No, which is strange,
'cause I remember

563
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:28,352
the face of everyone
I've been with.

564
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:30,554
Hmm.
Oh, maybe
she's mask girl.

565
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:31,889
Let me guess:
Halloween?

566
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:33,691
What? No.
President's Day.

567
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:35,159
(chuckles) Or maybe,
I don't remember

568
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:37,094
'cause it was just another
meaningless encounter.

569
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:40,564
This case not the trip down
memory lane you were hoping for?

570
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:42,099
Oh, it's almost enough
to make a man

571
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:44,101
question the way
he's lived his life.

572
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:45,269
Almost.

573
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,436
Well, luckily this girl
gives me hope.

574
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:49,573
At least one of my former lovers
might be willing to kill for me.

575
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:52,443
Oh. It's open.

576
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:55,846
LAPD. Anyone home?

577
00:21:57,684 --> 00:21:59,884
Well, this isn't creepy at all.

578
00:22:04,724 --> 00:22:07,725
See? I told you someone cared.

579
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:14,732
Look at this.

580
00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:17,401
Multiple chest hair options.
Amazing.

581
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:19,103
I can make a lasting impression.

582
00:22:19,105 --> 00:22:22,273
Yeah, on someone
with serious issues.

583
00:22:22,275 --> 00:22:24,875
This woman is clearly deranged,

584
00:22:24,877 --> 00:22:26,777
dangerous, and...

585
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:30,414
Why am I on this wall?

586
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:32,583
Well, maybe she can just
sense the inevitable.

587
00:22:32,585 --> 00:22:34,285
(toilet flushes)

588
00:22:34,287 --> 00:22:36,220
Suki Price? LAPD.

589
00:22:38,124 --> 00:22:39,890
What're you doing in my--

590
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:41,158
(screams)
Lucifer!

591
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,660
Okay, hey, hey.
What--

592
00:22:42,662 --> 00:22:45,763
(toilet flushes)
Hey, come out
with your hands up.

593
00:22:51,471 --> 00:22:53,771
This is one of
your exes?

594
00:22:53,773 --> 00:22:56,240
Do you know,
I'm really not sure...

595
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:57,908
I-- darling, could you do this?

596
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:01,312
And say, "I am
not a crook."

597
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:04,982
No, it's definitely not
Sexy Richard Nixon.

598
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:07,251
I'm quite certain
we've not slept together.

599
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:09,019
Well, I could have
told you that.

600
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:10,621
Care to explain
the wall?

601
00:23:11,457 --> 00:23:13,424
Oh... I'm just...

602
00:23:13,426 --> 00:23:15,426
really into Lucifer.

603
00:23:15,428 --> 00:23:17,428
(chuckles)
And who could blame you.

604
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,629
You're my perfect man.

605
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:21,599
Like porn
and stuffed crust pizza

606
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:25,269
and my Hello Kitty blankie
all rolled into one.

607
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,672
I've loved you from afar.

608
00:23:28,674 --> 00:23:29,473
LUCIFER:
Right.

609
00:23:29,475 --> 00:23:30,741
I see what's
happened here.

610
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:33,043
Not having sex with me
drove her into a murderous,

611
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:34,178
psychotic rage.

612
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,347
Murder?

613
00:23:36,349 --> 00:23:37,515
What are you talking about?

614
00:23:37,517 --> 00:23:38,716
We're investigating the
deaths of Jana Lawrence

615
00:23:38,718 --> 00:23:41,685
and Raj Daniere.
Have you heard of 'em?

616
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:45,723
I have all of Lucifer's lovers
categorized.

617
00:23:45,725 --> 00:23:46,657
Uh, uh...

618
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:49,193
here is the flight
attendant section.

619
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:51,695
Here's Jana with Raj.

620
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:53,364
CHLOE: So the two of them
knew each other?

621
00:23:53,366 --> 00:23:55,699
Raj is Jana's GBFFN.

622
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:58,836
<i> Was</i> her GBFFN.

623
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:01,739
A gay best friend for now.

624
00:24:01,741 --> 00:24:03,307
Oh.

625
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:05,943
She sometimes crashed on his
couch whenever she was in L.A.

626
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:08,379
Hmm. And w-what are
these numbers about here?

627
00:24:08,381 --> 00:24:10,648
Date from two days ago.

628
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:13,984
The last time
Lucifer and Jana

629
00:24:13,986 --> 00:24:15,152
hooked up.

630
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:16,687
LUCIFER: Right.
Much as I admire

631
00:24:16,689 --> 00:24:18,422
your dedication to this
creepy stalker business,

632
00:24:18,424 --> 00:24:21,358
I have to correct you,
there was no hookup.
Mm.

633
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,861
But I made
a commemorative doll.

634
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,533
You're wearing your new suit.

635
00:24:29,535 --> 00:24:32,536
Yes, what excellent detail
on the French cuffs.

636
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:34,305
That's what I was
doing last night.

637
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:36,006
Oh, you can ask the
pizza delivery man.

638
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:37,875
He helped me
with these

639
00:24:37,877 --> 00:24:39,343
teeny tiny buttons.

640
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:42,379
Ask him.
(sniffs)

641
00:24:42,381 --> 00:24:45,015
Who's the third person
in this photo?

642
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:51,555
SUKI: Uh, that's
a pilot Jana works with.

643
00:24:51,557 --> 00:24:53,157
Those three hang out together
all the time.

644
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,326
Maybe he knows
what happened.

645
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:56,327
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

646
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:57,628
Look, I'm gonna
send an officer by

647
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,196
to get a full statement
from you.

648
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:00,631
Do not leave town.

649
00:25:01,434 --> 00:25:04,735
And abandon Lucifer?

650
00:25:04,737 --> 00:25:07,037
(Suki chuckles)

651
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,340
Never.

652
00:25:11,911 --> 00:25:13,878
Right, good-bye.

653
00:25:16,282 --> 00:25:17,882

Mm-hmm.
Oh...

659
00:25:41,474 --> 00:25:43,941
And you want me
to try this because...?

660
00:25:43,943 --> 00:25:46,911
This "espresso" concoction
is my favorite thing

661
00:25:46,913 --> 00:25:48,178
about humanity so far.

662
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,947
Well, besides sex, but...

663

664
00:25:50,783 --> 00:25:52,082
You're looking well
these days.

665
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:54,418
So confident, so cheery.

666
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,887
(chuckles)
I almost didn't recognize you.

667
00:25:56,889 --> 00:26:00,424
Thanks to you, Mom.
You found a way to get us home.

668
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:01,792
But...

669
00:26:01,794 --> 00:26:04,094
manipulating Lucifer
and Chloe toward each other

670
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:05,362
for our own gain...

671
00:26:05,364 --> 00:26:07,031
Your Father is the one
that started all of this.

672
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:10,000
We are simply bringing it
to an end.

673
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:11,535
On our terms.

674
00:26:11,537 --> 00:26:13,671
I've tried to manipulate
Lucifer before.

675
00:26:13,673 --> 00:26:15,139
It didn't end well.

676
00:26:15,141 --> 00:26:17,274
That's because you lied to him.

677
00:26:17,276 --> 00:26:19,376
Lucifer respects the truth.

678
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:20,911
So use that to get us all home.

679
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:23,981
And then, we can
put all of this behind us.

680
00:26:28,554 --> 00:26:29,787
This is delicious.

681
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:32,089
Mm-hmm.
Still not as good as sex.

682
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:33,257
Mom!

683
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:35,826
Please.

684
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:37,962
DAN: Our pilot's name
is Tim Pickman.

685
00:26:37,964 --> 00:26:40,097
He's got a record:
drugs and assault.

686
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:41,465
Used to work for a big airline,

687
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:43,701
now he flies rich
dudes on small jets.

688
00:26:43,703 --> 00:26:46,403
His recent routes are...

689
00:26:46,405 --> 00:26:48,939
The Caribbean, Mexico
City, Ahmedabad.

690
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,442
Yes, all hotspots
for drug smugglers.

691
00:26:51,444 --> 00:26:52,810
O-Or so I'm told.

692
00:26:52,812 --> 00:26:55,546
Working for a private airline
would be the perfect cover.

693
00:26:55,548 --> 00:26:58,515
You have quick travel,
lax customs agents...

694
00:26:58,517 --> 00:27:00,117
And if Pickman was
smuggling drugs,

695
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,952
maybe Jana and Raj
found out about it,

696
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:04,555
threatened to squeal, so he
shut 'em up permanently.

697
00:27:04,557 --> 00:27:06,156
Yes, murder's
handy that way.

698
00:27:06,158 --> 00:27:07,891
Okay, where do we find him?

699
00:27:07,893 --> 00:27:09,293

to know why?

792

for my friends

your thanks.

00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:46,349
with very different priorities.

893
00:34:46,351 --> 00:34:49,386
My priority right now
is this case.

894
00:34:49,388 --> 00:34:51,621
Okay? So, just...

895
00:34:51,623 --> 00:34:53,890
step outside and get some air.

896
00:34:53,892 --> 00:34:55,625
I don't need air.

897
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:57,060
Well, I do.

898
00:34:59,364 --> 00:35:01,431
Right.

899
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:02,799
Understood.

900
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:05,001
♪ ♪

901
00:35:15,547 --> 00:35:17,547
(sighs)

902
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:24,521
A man just entered the bar.

903
00:35:24,523 --> 00:35:27,224
Got you.

904
00:35:28,927 --> 00:35:30,727
You are one of the
prettiest flight attendants

905
00:35:30,729 --> 00:35:31,862
I've ever seen.

906
00:35:31,864 --> 00:35:33,530
Oh.
I'm Burt.

907
00:35:33,532 --> 00:35:35,532
Hi, Burt.

908
00:35:35,534 --> 00:35:37,501
You ready for takeoff?

909
00:35:38,537 --> 00:35:40,337
(chuckles)

910
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:43,073
They're on their way
to the hotel room.

911
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:55,285
Are you ready for the package?

912
00:35:55,287 --> 00:35:59,556
Mm-hmm. I think that's
supposed to be my line.

913
00:36:02,528 --> 00:36:04,027
I know you killed
that flight attendant

914
00:36:04,029 --> 00:36:05,829
and her friend, dirtbag.

915
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:08,031
(grunts)

916
00:36:09,701 --> 00:36:11,101
No, no, no! My name's Jim!

917
00:36:11,103 --> 00:36:12,335
Some guy gave me a C-note,

918
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:14,437
told me to sit next to you
and say I was Burt.

919
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:15,939
(screams)

920
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,440
If that's not our killer
then where is he?

921
00:36:23,482 --> 00:36:26,416
I believe you have something
that belongs to me.

922
00:36:26,418 --> 00:36:28,718
(chuckles)

923
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,154
Burt, I presume.

924
00:36:35,594 --> 00:36:37,861
(Jim groaning)

925
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:39,196
Can I keep him?

926
00:36:39,198 --> 00:36:40,463
JIM:
Get her off me!

927
00:36:40,465 --> 00:36:41,331
She's insane!

928
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:42,599
Well, you better start talking.

929
00:36:42,601 --> 00:36:44,100
Where's the man
that paid you?

930
00:36:44,102 --> 00:36:47,504
I don't know. He saw some tall
guy with dark hair in a suit.

931
00:36:47,506 --> 00:36:48,605
He took off.

932
00:36:48,607 --> 00:36:49,873
That's Lucifer.

933
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,308
Yeah.

934
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:54,177
Recognized you
from the beach party.

935
00:36:54,179 --> 00:36:55,545
Of course.
Tommy Bahama.

936
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:56,913
It's good that you found me,

937
00:36:56,915 --> 00:36:58,748
'cause I've been meaning
to ask you something since then.

938
00:36:59,785 --> 00:37:01,051
Where'd you get the water slide?

939
00:37:01,053 --> 00:37:02,219
I'd love one for Lux.

940
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:03,620
I'm not sure where I'd put it...

941
00:37:03,622 --> 00:37:04,621
I want my package.

942
00:37:04,623 --> 00:37:07,624
Now.

943
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:10,626
I should've known Jana left it
with you after I saw her at Lux.

944
00:37:10,629 --> 00:37:13,430
That's why she was only there
a few minutes-- to stash it.

945
00:37:13,432 --> 00:37:16,366
No, the reason that she left
so quickly was because

946
00:37:16,368 --> 00:37:19,035
she was unhappy
that I didn't have sex with her.

947
00:37:19,037 --> 00:37:21,037
Yeah, I don't believe you.

948
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:22,806
No one says no
to a girl like that.

949
00:37:22,808 --> 00:37:25,976
I'm finding it hard to believe
myself, trust me, but, uh,

950
00:37:25,978 --> 00:37:29,145
as for your package, Burt...

951
00:37:29,147 --> 00:37:30,780
I don't have it.

952
00:37:30,782 --> 00:37:32,182
Liar.

953
00:37:32,184 --> 00:37:33,883
Oh, come now.

954
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:35,285
Surely a little bit of cocaine

955
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:37,387
isn't worth all
the senseless killing.

956
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:39,356
Cocaine?

957
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:42,092
What's in that package
is far more valuable than drugs.

958
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:43,893
Oh.
It's my ass on the line,

959
00:37:43,895 --> 00:37:45,462
and that stupid bitch Jana...

960
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:53,336
You don't speak of her that way.

961
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:56,206
You promised Jana the world

962
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:59,009
and everything
she could ever desire.

963
00:37:59,011 --> 00:38:02,112
Money, drugs,
a life of pleasure,

964
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:05,782
but she deserved
better than that...

965
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:08,718
better than you...

966
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,787
or me.

967
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:15,692
I mean, what did either of us
really give her?

968
00:38:15,694 --> 00:38:17,227
Empty pleasure?

969
00:38:18,063 --> 00:38:20,096
Hey, man...

970
00:38:20,098 --> 00:38:21,798
we can work something out.

971
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,466
(chuckles)

972
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:25,602
I'll find the package.
I'll get paid. We'll...

973
00:38:25,604 --> 00:38:27,504
We're similar in a lot of ways,
aren't we, Burt?

974
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,674
Except for one.

975
00:38:30,676 --> 00:38:34,844
You're a bad man and I'm not.

976
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:39,082
I'm much...

977
00:38:39,084 --> 00:38:41,851
much worse than that.

978
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:44,120
(shouting)

979
00:38:48,226 --> 00:38:50,427
(shouts)
Lucifer!

980
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:54,664
There's your killer,
detectives.

981
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,733
Think you'll find he feels
quite remorseful

982
00:38:56,735 --> 00:38:58,385
about the life he's led.

983
00:38:58,386 --> 00:39:00,036
Please... okay, p-please,
just-just arrest me, okay?

984
00:39:00,038 --> 00:39:01,137
Okay, get up.
I'm sorry.

985
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:02,806
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Stand up.

986
00:39:02,808 --> 00:39:04,808
I'm sorry.

987
00:39:08,747 --> 00:39:10,547
Hey.

988
00:39:10,549 --> 00:39:12,182
About what you heard
in the van...

989
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:13,550
Hey, it doesn't matter...

990
00:39:13,552 --> 00:39:15,685
except something
still bothers me.

991
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:19,723
Burt went to a lot of trouble
for a single drug deal.

992
00:39:19,725 --> 00:39:24,394
Yeah, well... the guy had
a reputation to protect.

993
00:39:24,396 --> 00:39:27,297
You know? One person
steals from him,

994
00:39:27,299 --> 00:39:29,099
everyone else thinks
they can, too.

995
00:39:29,101 --> 00:39:32,435
CHLOE:<i> All right.</i>
<i> But then who has the package?</i>

996
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:40,343
How... how did you find me?

997
00:39:40,345 --> 00:39:42,912
I'm sorry I took it.
I was desperate.

998
00:39:42,914 --> 00:39:44,347
I'm broke.

999
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:46,082
When the stewardess let it slip

1000
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:48,485
how much cash she was gonna make
from this delivery, I...

1001
00:39:48,487 --> 00:39:50,754
I thought it was drugs.

1002
00:39:50,756 --> 00:39:53,189
I was gonna sell them.

1003
00:39:53,191 --> 00:39:54,924
Then I opened it.

1004
00:39:54,926 --> 00:39:57,127
One of them broke.

1005
00:39:57,129 --> 00:39:59,929
I spilled a little on myself.
Now...

1006
00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:04,801
What the hell
is happening to me?

1007
00:40:04,803 --> 00:40:07,036
(grunts)

1008
00:40:07,038 --> 00:40:08,671
(choking)

1009
00:40:27,993 --> 00:40:31,528
Hey, I've been looking
for you everywhere.

1010
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:33,329
I tracked your phone's GPS.

1011
00:40:33,331 --> 00:40:36,599
Well... here I am.

1012
00:40:37,903 --> 00:40:40,470
Well, we should wrap up
the arrest report,

1013
00:40:40,472 --> 00:40:43,673
and by that I mean paperwork,
not some celebratory drink

1014
00:40:43,675 --> 00:40:46,176
that you'll then
turn into a moment.

1015
00:40:46,178 --> 00:40:48,645
(chuckles)
Yes, well...

1016
00:40:48,647 --> 00:40:50,647
I've changed my mind
about that, actually.

1017
00:40:50,649 --> 00:40:53,383
I realized it would never
work out between us.

1018
00:40:53,385 --> 00:40:54,684
Really?
Yes.

1019
00:40:54,686 --> 00:41:00,089
So, from now on,
no more attempts at moments.

1020
00:41:00,091 --> 00:41:04,327
I'd be honored to, uh, simply
continue working by your side...

1021
00:41:05,163 --> 00:41:07,363
...if you'll have me.

1022
00:41:07,365 --> 00:41:08,498
Of course.

1023
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,933
Good.
Yeah.

1024
00:41:09,935 --> 00:41:11,668
It's not like you
to give up, but...

1025
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,303
Oh, no, I haven't given up.

1026
00:41:13,305 --> 00:41:16,406
I had a...
an epiphany, of sorts.

1027
00:41:16,408 --> 00:41:19,709
You deserve someone worthy
of you and that isn't me.

1028
00:41:19,711 --> 00:41:21,744
That's not what
I've been saying, Lucifer.

1029
00:41:21,746 --> 00:41:24,614
I know.
It's what I'm saying.

1030
00:41:24,616 --> 00:41:28,251
You... deserve someone better

1031
00:41:28,253 --> 00:41:30,253
because you, Detective,

1032
00:41:30,255 --> 00:41:33,022
are selfless
to a nauseating degree.

1033
00:41:35,527 --> 00:41:37,527
You always put
your daughter first,

1034
00:41:37,529 --> 00:41:39,329
even though the ungrateful
urchin does nothing

1035
00:41:39,331 --> 00:41:40,730
to contribute to the rent.

1036
00:41:40,732 --> 00:41:42,432
(laughs)
So...

1037
00:41:42,434 --> 00:41:44,868
you deserve someone
worthy of that grace.

1038
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:48,004
Someone who knows that every
crime scene breaks your heart,

1039
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:50,406
even though
you'd never admit it.

1040
00:41:50,408 --> 00:41:52,675
Someone who
actually appreciates

1041
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:54,811
your impossibly boring
middle name.

1042
00:41:54,813 --> 00:41:56,997
Jane.

1043
00:41:56,998 --> 00:41:59,182
More importantly, Detective,
you deserve someone

1044
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:01,751
as good as you...

1045
00:42:01,753 --> 00:42:03,586
because...

1046
00:42:03,588 --> 00:42:07,924
well, you're special and I'm...

1047
00:42:09,294 --> 00:42:11,861
...I'm not worth it.

1048
00:42:16,468 --> 00:42:20,537
Yeah, you're probably right.

1049
00:42:28,446 --> 00:42:30,647
Detective...
