1
00:00:00,368 --> 00:00:04,470
<i> Previously on</i> Lucifer...
         I was worried
    I'd never see you again.

2
00:00:04,472 --> 00:00:06,472
I've had patients who
             revealed a new side

3
00:00:06,474 --> 00:00:08,640
of themselves,
                 but not so much

4
00:00:08,642 --> 00:00:10,809
the actual devil.

5
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:13,445
We're good, right?
Yeah. Really good.

6
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:14,613
We could be there for
           each other as friends

7
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:16,048
even if it's about
                    another guy.

8
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,116
What is she doing here?

9
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:19,051
Charlotte Richards,
     the defense attorney.

10
00:00:19,053 --> 00:00:21,220
Thought I'd dive
      into my employment.

11
00:00:21,222 --> 00:00:22,654
Humans are dying because of you.

12
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:24,456
MOM:
<i> I'm stronger than you'd think.</i>

13
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,892
<i> You seem attached</i>
      <i> to these creatures,</i>

14
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:29,228
and I can't figure out why.

15
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,230
We shouldn't be here!

16
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:35,134
The only place I've ever felt
      wanted or respected.

17
00:00:35,136 --> 00:00:36,668
Is here with humanity?

18
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,037
This is my home!

19
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:39,772
Deal with it, Mother!

20
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,076
¶ Oh, oh ¶

21
00:00:44,078 --> 00:00:47,079
¶ My heart is beating
     and I'm under attack ¶

22
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:50,516
¶ Don't need it sure
 'cause I don't wanna go back ¶

23
00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:52,251
¶ I'm giving in... ¶

24
00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:55,254
MALE TOUR GUIDE (over P.A.):
  Sunshine. Beautiful people.

25
00:00:55,256 --> 00:00:57,423
Expensive cars.

26
00:00:57,425 --> 00:01:00,692
The glamorous life. Get
           ready to see the real

27
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:02,895
Los Angeles on this thrill

28
00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:04,096
ride tour.

29
00:01:04,098 --> 00:01:05,697
Well, it appears
I've been misled.

30
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:07,266
Whoever put together
this brochure

31
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:09,068
should get
special treatment in Hell.

32
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,537
I don't need you to
        show me around the city.

33
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:13,105
Well, of course you do.

34
00:01:13,107 --> 00:01:15,107
This is an exciting time,
brother!

35
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:16,742
Now that we're making
Los Angeles our home,

36
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:18,444
the City of Angels can
finally earn its name.

37
00:01:18,446 --> 00:01:21,613
You are making it a home.

38
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:24,216
Mom and I are gonna find a way
 to get back to the Silver City.

39
00:01:24,218 --> 00:01:26,518
One way or another.
But why?

40
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,921
When Los Angeles
has so much to offer?

41
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:30,722
TOUR GUIDE:
On your right,

42
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:32,458
you'll see the
                    famous shop,

43
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,694
Pooch Pouch, the
         store that sells purses

44
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,930
for purse-sized dogs.

45
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:40,299
Clearly.
(mutters)

46
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:42,101
Don't get it confused
         with the store
Excuse me. Sorry.

47
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:43,435
that sells dogs in the
               shapes of purses.

48
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:45,137
Sorry, I do apologize.

49
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:47,139
That's on your left...
Pardon me, excuse me.

50
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:48,707
Yeah, thank you.

51
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:50,142
Please. That's your corner.

52
00:01:50,144 --> 00:01:52,978
Ah. Right. Forget everything

53
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,213
you just slept through.

54
00:01:54,215 --> 00:01:55,747
Welcome to Los Angeles,

55
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:58,117
city of reinvention,
            where you can become

56
00:01:58,119 --> 00:01:59,952
whomever you want.

57
00:01:59,954 --> 00:02:01,487
Uh, if we look over here--

58
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:03,755
that humongous house in
        the distance, the owner,

59
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:06,758
he moved out here with just
    ten dollars and a dream.

60
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,293
Within three years,
                  he was running

61
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:10,562
the largest underground sex club
        in the country.

62
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:13,298
Los Angeles is also a
          place where you can do

63
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,734
whatever you want. To your
      right hand side over here,

64
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:18,270
this folically challenged man--
that's Sleepy Pete. Hello, Pete.

65
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:19,771
Give us a wave.

66
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:20,772
Everyone wave at Pete.

67
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:22,574
(camera shutters clicking)

68
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:25,410
He will sell you the best
Molly in the city.

69
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:27,179
(Lucifer chuckles)

70
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:28,413
Don't buy his cocaine, though.

71
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:30,182
It's got enough baking soda
     in it to make a cake.

72
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:32,985
It's not a bad idea,
      as I think about it.

73
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:36,188
To your right again--
       my nightclub, Lux!

74
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,590
The city's crowning achievement.

75
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:40,759
My brother and I are
         celebrating...

76
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:48,000
<i> I don't understand him.</i>

77
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:51,036
Why won't Amenadiel embrace
this city like I have?

78
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:54,206
Well, people often need time
      to adjust to change.

79
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,208
And he's only been
          here for a few months.

80
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,543
And if what you say is true...

81
00:02:57,545 --> 00:02:59,778
What? That he's got a stick
       so far up his ass

82
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,446
you can see it when he yawns?

83
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:03,015
That he's a fallen angel.

84
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:04,550
Oh, yes, that, too.

85
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:07,386
Then this could be about more
    than finding a home for him.

86
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:09,221
But we're here
       to talk about you.

87
00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:12,357
Why did you recently decide
    that this was your home?

88
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:15,460
Well, I said it
when I was in a row with my mum.

89
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:18,230
I didn't realize how true it was
 until I yelled it in her face.

90
00:03:18,232 --> 00:03:19,398
Yes, your mother,

91
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,235
who is a literal goddess
        of all creation.

92
00:03:23,237 --> 00:03:25,237
Still haven't quite wrapped
   my brain around that one.

93
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:27,039
Yes, well, anyway,
     her and Amenadiel want

94
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:31,043
to get back to the Silver City,
     but it's not my home.

95
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:32,211
It never was.

96
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:33,345
And neither was Hell.

97
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:34,980
No. No, that was somewhere

98
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:36,415
I was sent as a punishment.

99
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:38,884
Like the DMV,
      but less screaming.

100
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:42,054
So would you say
 that this is your first home?

101
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:43,822
Yes, I suppose it is.

102
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,424
And why do you think
        that's the case?

103
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:47,826
Well, I don't know, Doctor.
          You tell me.

104
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:49,428
I find that people

105
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,864
make Los Angeles their home
    for one of two reasons.

106
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:55,000
Either they're running
        from something,

107
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:57,269
or looking for something.

108
00:03:57,271 --> 00:03:58,837
Oh, and which one are you?

109
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,606
I'm not the one on the couch,
            Lucifer.

110
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:03,242
(laughs, sighs)
               So ask yourself--

111
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:05,377
which is it?

112
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:07,846
Running or looking?

113
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:10,449
CHLOE:
      <i> Lucifer? Lucifer?!</i>

114
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:12,451
Get out of the chair.

115
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:13,885
Oh, come on, Detective.

116
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:16,288
It's been ages
since I've sat in a throne.

117
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,390
Oh, there's a lot of
personality here, isn't there?

118
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:20,259
Appalling personality,

119
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:21,893
but quantity
over quality, I suppose.

120
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:23,595
(sighs)
(laughs)

121
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,598
Genuine Medieval knights costume
in a Bel Air mansion?

122
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,934
This man's home
   definitely was his castle.

123
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:31,270
Well, it couldn't keep
         him safe from invaders.

124
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:33,772
Crime scene. Let's go.

125
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:37,409
Hang on.

126
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:40,279
That's Dean Cooper, the
 Los Angeles real-estate tycoon!

127
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:41,713
Yeah, owns the whole block,

128
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:44,082
and most of the biggest
   developments in the city.

129
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:45,917
Including the entire block
        that Lux is on.

130
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,152
Deeply unpleasant man.

131
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:48,887
You wouldn't believe
                  the deal I had

132
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,289
to strike for my lease.

133
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,090
All completely legal.

134
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:55,494
If somewhat, well,
 let's say "morally ambiguous."

135
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:58,130
Well, that moral ambiguity
       that he was so famous for

136
00:04:58,132 --> 00:04:59,731
may have finally
             caught up with him.

137
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,266
Ella, cause of death?

138
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:04,303
Explosive exsanguination from

139
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:06,171
the carotid,
punctured

140
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:09,941
by this.

141
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:11,343
Like from a
                champagne flute.

142
00:05:11,345 --> 00:05:13,979
Mm-hmm.
Someone really popped his cork.

143
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:17,115
You know like... (makes
   explosive, hissing sounds)

144
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:18,950
You guys, like,
the blood's the champagne.

145
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:21,353
Like when you open a bottle,
      his neck was the...

146
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:22,421
We got it.

147
00:05:22,423 --> 00:05:24,122
Did you get
                     any prints?

148
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:25,457
Killer wiped it clean.

149
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:27,125
Okay, well,

150
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:28,527
maybe he didn't
            wipe the glass clean

151
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:30,362
before it broke.
                Ella, are any of

152
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:32,798
these pieces here big enough
          to get a partial from?

153
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,800
Probably not.

154
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:38,337
But, hey, someone invented glue
         for a reason.

155
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:40,372
Right?
                 You're going to
    reassemble all those pieces?

156
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:41,707
LUCIFER:
                      I'm fairly

157
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:43,342
certain there are people in Hell
          being forced

158
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:45,444
to do exactly that right now.
Oh, I was the kind

159
00:05:45,446 --> 00:05:47,346
of kid who did jigsaw puzzles
       picture-side down.
        (phone ringing)

160
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:49,681
That's fascinating.
                             Mm.

161
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,183
Oh.

162
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:52,351
What's wrong?

163
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:54,553
Maze. Problem at Lux.

164
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:56,688
Problem? What? One of the
        Brittanies stub her toe?

165
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,357
You're leaving?

166
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:00,492
Lucifer, Cooper was one
           of the most hated men

167
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:02,961
in the city. We have tons
    of suspects to go over.

168
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:04,563
And if I don't get there soon,

169
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:07,199
Maze will undoubtedly fix the
 problem herself, which usually

170
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:08,400
involves knives.
                    But...

171
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:09,468
So unless you want to be blamed

172
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,970
for a four-toed Brittany...

173
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:22,381
Uh... hello?

174
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:23,715
We're closed.

175
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,651
Hi, okay, we've got
            some anomalies here,

176
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:29,020
especially with
              the quarterlies...

177
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:31,223
Maze, did you forget

178
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:33,825
to bribe the
          inspectors this month?

179
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:35,193
Are you the proprietor?

180
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:37,028
I am, yes.

181
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,765
And who are you, lounging
  around like you own the place?

182
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:42,200
Oh, I actually do
own the place.

183
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:45,036
Lucifer Morningstar,

184
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:46,505
you're being evicted.

185
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:51,009
¶ ¶

186
00:06:58,385 --> 00:07:00,218
All right, explain what
          you mean by "evicted,"

187
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,421
and do it carefully as
     your life may depend on it.

188
00:07:02,423 --> 00:07:05,457
Okay, Mr. Morningstar.
My name is Eric Cooper.

189
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:08,059
I've assumed all
of Cooper's holding

190
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:10,228
and assets, Lux among them.

191
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,564
You're Dean Cooper's son.

192
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:15,467
Your father was just
 brutally murdered, and here you

193
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:17,269
scant hours after
              you were notified,

194
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:18,770
divvying up the spoils.

195
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,606
I don't know whether to
      be horrified or impressed.

196
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,776
What happened to my father
was unfortunate.

197
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:25,577
Yes.

198
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:28,780
But business is business.

199
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:32,484
Well, impressed it is.

200
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:35,287
Your father and I made a deal
      for me to live here,

201
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:37,255
so I'm sure you and I
can come to some agreement.

202
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:41,326
Tell me, Eric,
what is it you desire?

203
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:42,627
(gasps)

204
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,263
I want my father to turn over
         in his grave.

205
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:46,264
Ooh.

206
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:47,933
Hated the old man, eh?

207
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:49,301
Well, I can relate to that.

208
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:50,902
My father's not on
my Christmas card list either.

209
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:54,005
In fact, I moved here
to get away from him.

210
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:56,107
Surely you can understand that.

211
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:59,311
No, not really.

212
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:01,913
And I saw your "lease"--

213
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:05,450
it was written in lipstick
on a stripper's thong.

214
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:08,487
Not exactly legally binding.
                             Hm.

215
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:10,322
Well, maybe we can
  write the new one in blood.

216
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:11,690
I find that to be quite binding.

217
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:13,492
Let's not.

218
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:15,126
You have no legal right
          to be here,

219
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:16,761
so if you don't vacate,

220
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:17,929
I'll have you removed.

221
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:19,097
(laughs)

222
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:21,867
It's not that easy to remove me.

223
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:23,535
Last time,
   it took the power of God.

224
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:26,304
What do you have--
    a few expensive lawyers?

225
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:28,306
Or are you gonna do it yourself?

226
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:30,709
Not in front of all
        of these humans.

227
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:34,546
If I were you, I'd leave.

228
00:08:34,548 --> 00:08:35,847
That's fine.

229
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,016
This is a police matter now.

230
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:41,553
Let's go.

231
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:42,554
All right, let's go.

232
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:43,688
Let's go, man.

233
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,724
It's not like you
to get in the way

234
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:47,325
of a good
eviscerating, Maze.

235
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:48,560
What was that about?

236
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:51,196
You'd be eviscerating
       the wrong person.

237
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,497
This is your mother's doing.

238
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:55,166
(scoffs)
           Mum? How?

239
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:57,969
You told her you want
          to stay here on Earth.

240
00:08:57,971 --> 00:09:00,906
Now someone's trying to
         take Lux away from you.

241
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:02,340
Don't be absurd, Maze.

242
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:04,643
I just saw
   American Psycho's father.

243
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:06,912
The man wasn't destroyed
  by the Goddess of Creation.

244
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:09,381
He was killed in a fit
of human passion.

245
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,550
But that greasy weasel
        might be right.

246
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:13,718
This is a police matter.
           Lucky me.

247
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,753
Don't act like
                     your mother

248
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:16,655
isn't capable
               of this, Lucifer.

249
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:18,990
Ah, that's enough help
from you today Maze, thank you.

250
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:20,725
(smacks bar)
        All right, fine.

251
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,662
You can't see it,
  I'll find someone who will.

252
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:25,430
I don't see it.

253
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:27,666
Of course you don't.

254
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:30,235
So after you said
you'd "handle things,"

255
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,103
you're hiding
behind her skirt again?

256
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:34,005
I am handling things, Maze.

257
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:35,840
Mom and I are trying to
           find a way back home.

258
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:37,609
So why would she
              murder some human?

259
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:38,743
That woman is

260
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,780
dangerous, duplicitous...

261
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:43,982
And she's standing
  right behind me, isn't she?

262
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:46,751
Pardon my interruption,

263
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,587
but what am I being
blamed for now?

264
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:50,021
I know what you're doing,

265
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:52,557
trying to take away
    Lucifer's home on Earth,

266
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,693
so he can help
                    you get back

267
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:56,227
to the Silver City.

268
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:57,596
It won't work.

269
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:58,930
The demon is talking,

270
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,699
but not making any sense.

271
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:02,400
Typical, I suppose.

272
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:03,602
She thinks you
                  killed the man

273
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:05,937
who owns Lux to
            get Lucifer evicted.

274
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,473
(chuckles)

275
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:10,642
Mazikeen.

276
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:13,411
If I did come up
               with such a plan,

277
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:17,048
do you think it would be
         you who figured it out?

278
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,150
Whatever you're up to,

279
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:20,819
I will find out.

280
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,061
Oh, she thinks she's smart.

281
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:32,430
Mom?

282
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:33,999
You weren't actually involved
            in that man's death,

283
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:36,468
right?
Well, of course not.

284
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:40,438
But it might be able
  to be used to our advantage.

285
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,843
Maybe Lucifer will agree
to come home with us now.

286
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:46,444
Right.

287
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:49,781
All my sons are important.

288
00:10:49,783 --> 00:10:51,816
It isn't about Lucifer.

289
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,318
It's about our family.

290
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,654
I've already lost a son.

291
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:59,491
I will not leave
      another one behind.

292
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:01,693
It doesn't matter, Mom.

293
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:04,295
Lucifer loves that place.

294
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:05,830
And no human is gonna
             make him give it up

295
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,866
as long as it's still standing.

296
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:09,868
Is that so?

297
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,870
¶ ¶

298
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,746
Careful...

299
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:27,318
And that is how we do it!

00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,690
<i> Ta' von</i> what?

302
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:34,025
It's Klingon for
     "the king is trapped."

303
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,695
In<i> Star Trek,</i> they play
    three-dimensional chess.

304
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:38,730
Okay.

305
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:41,900
And I'm gonna check this
        for prints now.

306
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:43,501
Great.
                     No problem.

307
00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:44,703
Hey.

308
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,805
All our info
                 on Dean Cooper.

309
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:49,541
No rap sheet, which,
quite frankly, is pretty amazing

310
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:50,909
considering his reputation.

311
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,477
Great. Thank you.

312
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:54,846
Hey, are you busy? I could use
    an assist on this case.

313
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:56,314
Nah, Vice has me wrapped up

314
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:58,183
on a bomb-making case.
I got to rush back.

315
00:11:58,185 --> 00:11:59,918
Where's Lucifer?

316
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,520
Something came up at his club.
I don't think he's coming back.

317
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:04,556
Oh, well, don't worry, Chloe.
He never stays away

318
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:05,857
for too long, right?
        (phone ringing)

319
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:07,525
Hmm?

320
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:09,260
Huh.

321
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:10,729
Hey, Lucifer. So, did you splint

322
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:13,531
the stubbed toe, or did you
  kiss it and make it better?

323
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:14,933
Well, that's
an interesting theory,

324
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:16,401
but we don't have any evidence

325
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,336
that Eric Cooper's the killer.

326
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:20,905
Mm, actually we do.

327
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:21,840
Prints just came back.

328
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:24,609
Eric Cooper.

329
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:26,878
How did you...?

330
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,849
Never mind. I'll meet you
    at the Cooper building.

00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:39,591
So wonderful that you agree
with me for a change, Detective.

333
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:40,592
Perhaps you're getting smarter.

334
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:41,593
I don't agree with you.

335
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:43,128
I have actual evidence
on Eric Cooper

336
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,295
that I need to look into.

337
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:45,797
What do you have?
                         Motive.

338
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,732
Little shark
           liquidated his father

339
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:49,400
so he could
           liquidate his assets.

340
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:50,969
How do you know
he's liquidating assets?

341
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:52,871
Because he's trying
            to evict me from Lux

342
00:12:52,873 --> 00:12:54,973
and sell off the building.

343
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:56,608
You're saying
that Dean Cooper's son

344
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,143
is making deals just an hour

345
00:12:58,145 --> 00:13:00,145
after his father was found dead?
                        Exactly.

346
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:02,781
What could be more suspicious?
              Hey.

347
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:04,149
When were you gonna
mention that you're

348
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:05,216
personally involved
in the case?

349
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:06,785
When you asked me.

350
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:08,319
Nope.

351
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:09,754
This an extremely
       high profile case.

352
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:10,789
We are doing this by the book.

353
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,223
I cannot have you
        terrorizing him.

354
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:13,792
I would never.

355
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:15,393
Or threatening
     to tear his arms off.

356
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:16,828
That happened one time.

357
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:17,796
Or hanging him from a window.

358
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,330
I solemnly promise
      that the man's feet

359
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:20,632
will remain firmly
         on the ground.

360
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:22,667
(man screams)

361
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:24,769
(car alarms ringing)

362
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:26,604
MAN:
          What's that?

363
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:28,273
WOMAN:
 Somebody call an ambulance...

364
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:29,607
MAN 2:
        Check this out.

365
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:31,442
MAN 3:
   There's a guy on the car!

366
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:33,444
(car alarm continues ringing)

367
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:34,646
WOMAN:
          Is he alive?

368
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:36,781
(groaning)

369
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:38,449
That's Eric Cooper.

370
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:41,019
Just to be clear,
that wasn't me.

371
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:46,758
¶ ¶

372
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,864
I mean, who leaps
    from the seventh floor?

373
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:56,034
13th, minimum. This is the man
forcing me from my home,

374
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:57,836
he can't even make
a proper suicide jump.

375
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:00,872
Lucifer.
Is this really necessary?

376
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:02,440
Well, witnesses saw him
              jump off a balcony

377
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:03,842
by his own free will.

378
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:04,843
He was distraught.

379
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:06,211
That doesn't make him a killer.

380
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:08,012
Well, it points
    to a guilty conscience.

381
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,281
Christi, I know this
 might be hard to hear, but...

382
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:12,884
we have evidence that Eric
   was in his father's house

383
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:13,852
before he died.

384
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:15,486
We live in the same compound.

385
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:18,056
I'm sure there's DNA or whatever
      all over the house.

386
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:21,392
You can't actually think
  that he killed his own father.

387
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:23,061
LUCIFER:
        Well, I mean...

388
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:24,062
Let's not forget

389
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:25,663
Eric's insatiable lust

390
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:27,298
for Daddy's cold hard cash.

391
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,067
If he's willing to do
something as monstrous

392
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:30,068
as turning me out of my house,

393
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,703
then killing his father

394
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,304
isn't such a stretch, is it?

395
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:34,906
(grunts)
LUCIFER:
Ooh!

396
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:36,674
My Left Foot's trying to speak.

397
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:37,675
N-No...

398
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:39,043
money.

399
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,345
Shh, baby.

400
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:41,679
Don't talk.

401
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:42,881
What are you
            trying to say, Eric?

402
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:44,249
(grunts)
             Dad...

403
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:46,217
ran the business
        into the ground.

404
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,853
We were buried in debt.

405
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:50,655
I thought making emergency sales

406
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:52,323
could save us, but...

407
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:54,259
CHRISTI:
                 But what, baby?

408
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:56,527
There's nothing left.

409
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:57,929
I'm sorry, I...

410
00:14:57,931 --> 00:14:59,898
I couldn't live
    with disappointing you.

411
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,499
LUCIFER:
Well, if this is about money,

412
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:04,869
you should have called me first,
 before taking that swan dive.

413
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:06,271
Perhaps you'd like
  to renegotiate now?

414
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:07,338
I can't.

415
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,073
The deal is made.

416
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,375
How could a sale
        be made so fast?

417
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:12,076
Dean Cooper died yesterday.

418
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,078
Is this that deal for all
   the property on the strip?

419
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,080
(grunts)

420
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,116
There's been a buyer
 interested in that for years.

421
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:19,751
Eric's dad had it all
               drawn up and then

422
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,052
just let it sit on his desk.

423
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:22,954
He just wanted
to torture the buyer.

424
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:24,923
So, you made the sale
      as soon as you heard

425
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:26,357
your father was gone?

426
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:28,760
Dad couldn't block it anymore.

427
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,795
But it didn't matter.

428
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:32,764
It wasn't enough.

429
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,899
What we have is enough.

430
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:36,935
You and me.

431
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:38,903
We don't need
                 money for that.

432
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:39,971
What a wonderful day.

433
00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:42,807
Potentially homeless
and definitely nauseated.

434
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:44,742
Well, whoever bought Lux
         stood to gain

435
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:46,611
from Dean Cooper's death.

436
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,579
Yes. This man,

437
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:50,381
the person who owns Lux now.
What's his name?

438
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:52,951
Her. It's Eleanor Bloom.

439
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:55,386
Detective, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

440
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:56,988
I doubt it.

441
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,157
But let's go talk
       to Eleanor Bloom.

442
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,291
Yeah.
           Thank you.

443
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,960
Thank you.

444
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:03,161
(shouts)
(gasps)

445
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:04,762
(grunting):
           Oh, God...

446
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:07,398
¶ I would like
      to get to know ya ¶

447
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,401
¶ If you think
     you're going my way ¶

448
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:13,805
¶ Or if you stay ¶

449
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:16,808
¶ With me just another day ¶

450
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,010
I think you're
in the wrong place, lady.

451
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:21,512
You're Kevin Burnick.
I am.

452
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:24,615
Why? You come to take
a peek at the legend?

453
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:26,818
According to the docket,
      one of your clients

454
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,586
is a known explosives expert

455
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:30,621
named Patrick O'Neil.

456
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:31,990
I need his help

457
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:34,192
to get my son
   to come back home with me.

458
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:37,195
You look hot and sound crazy,

459
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:39,163
which is totally my type.

460
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:42,166
But I don't talk about
        my clients out of court.

461
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,668
It's a lawyer thing.

462
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,204
Oh, you misunderstand me.

463
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:47,839
I'm his lawyer now.

464
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:49,207
You can go home.
                        (laughs)

465
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:50,775
(laughing):
          Look, lady.

466
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:52,443
I don't know what
     you've heard about me,

467
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:55,046
but when the K-Dog gets a bone,

468
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:56,447
(whispers):
       he doesn't let go.

469
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:58,383
Touch me, and I will sue you

470
00:16:58,385 --> 00:16:59,784
so hard...
            (smacks)

471
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:02,453
(tile shatters, grunts)

472
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:04,422
¶ ¶

473
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,626
¶ My love ¶

474
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:10,628
Oh...

475
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,863
¶ ¶

476
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:14,632
(distant siren wailing)

477
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:16,868
So, you think I had something
to do with Dean Cooper's death?

478
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,069
CHLOE:
            Well, barely an hour

479
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:19,871
after he was killed,
you closed on a deal

480
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,372
he'd been
obstructing for years.

481
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,673
Sounds convenient.

482
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:24,876
Sounds like good business to me.
Cooper intentionally

483
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,711
gave you
    businesswoman blue balls

484
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,079
just to torture you.

485
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:29,680
It's rather cruel.
          And I bought

486
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:31,482
his favorite golf course
    last year and turned it

487
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:33,217
into a landfill
       for medical waste.

488
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,053
Oh, I see. Well played.

489
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:36,087
So, you're saying
                    this was all

490
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:38,256
a multi-million
       dollar prank war?

491
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:40,191
I'm saying I didn't kill him
          over a deal.

492
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:42,060
Besides, I just flew in
   from Macau this afternoon.

493
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:44,695
Check with the airstrip.
 You have any other questions,

494
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:46,230
you can ask my lawyer.

495
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,532
Not so fast,
                 Mommy Warbucks.

496
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:49,333
I have some questions
                 for you myself.

497
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:51,069
Lucifer, you promised
      that you wouldn't...
                      Detective,

498
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:52,403
this woman has my home.

499
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,072
If you're gonna give me
       some sob story...

500
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:55,606
Oh, far from it.

501
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:57,708
I know your type.
 You don't respond to emotion,

502
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,077
or intimidation.

503
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,712
The only thing that gets
      you going is a deal.

504
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:03,414
So, let's make
a deal, shall we?

505
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:06,451
What do you desire?

506
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:09,287
Tell me and it's yours.

507
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:12,457
I want everything
        Dean Cooper has.

508
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:14,459
Well, Cooper owned Lux.

509
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:15,860
So, how about everything
        apart from that?

510
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:16,694
Everything.

511
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:17,728
All I want

512
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,297
is what was his.

513
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:21,299
And then to destroy it.

514
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:24,102
So, you're gonna tear down
     all of his properties?

515
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:25,937
I'm a developer.
I'm gonna knock everything down

516
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,138
and then rebuild.

517
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,239
Even Lux?

518
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:29,240
Especially that place.

519
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:30,741
That's prime real estate.

520
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:32,310
I'm gonna build a mega-mall.

521
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:33,544
A "mega-mall"?

522
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:34,912
Yeah, you know, Gymboree,
        Sunglass Hut...

523
00:18:34,914 --> 00:18:37,315
Bulldozers get rolling as soon
      as my people finish

524
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:38,649
emptying the buildings.

525
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:40,318
You know,

526
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,156
a murder investigation can
tie up a development for years.

527
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:46,891
I know you know more
    than you're telling us.

528
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:48,493
So, if there
                     is any way,

529
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:51,896
at all, that you can help
this investigation,

530
00:18:51,898 --> 00:18:54,165
that would be wonderful.
       (chuckles softly)

531
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:56,300
She's good.

532
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,668
I could use a few of her
          on my team.

533
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:02,240
The accountants
  I had looking over the deal

534
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:04,475
did find several
      unreported payments.

535
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,744
Hundreds of thousands
          of dollars.

536
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:08,179
You don't hide money like that

537
00:19:08,181 --> 00:19:09,847
unless you don't want
       anyone to find it.

538
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:17,688
Bloom was right.

539
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,957
Dean Cooper was making large
     off-the-books payments

540
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:22,026
and hiding them
       from his company.

541
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:23,361
Well, could be anything.

542
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:24,996
Drugs, blackmail.

543
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:27,298
There's no shortage of bad deeds
     in Dean Cooper's life.

544
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,767
I'm gonna try and trace
   where these payments went.

545
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:31,302
Maybe our killer's
       on the other end.

546
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:32,303
Oh, delightful.

547
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:34,005
Whilst you do that,
I'm gonna return

548
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:36,374
to Eleanor Bloom's office
and get my home back.

549
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:38,009
Not sure she's
          interested in selling.

550
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,810
Well, maybe
she'll change her mind

551
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:42,713
after I turn her world into a
 sphincter-loosening nightmare.

552
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:44,382
Ew. Lucifer.

553
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:46,617
I'm sorry about
your home. I am.

554
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:47,652
But you have
    to promise me you're not

555
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:49,020
really gonna hurt this woman.

556
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,988
Well, then, help me, Detective.
          Arrest her!

557
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,390
I mean, isn't contributing
        to homelessness

558
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:54,225
in Los Angeles a crime?

559
00:19:54,227 --> 00:19:56,227
Lucifer, the law is on
Bloom's side here.

560
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:58,529
I want to help you, but we have
to find a legal solution.

561
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,798
Okay. So I'm on my own, am I?

562
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,632
That's not what I--

563
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,648
We know you build bombs
           for the mob, Patrick.

564
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,250
That's ridiculous.

565
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:21,252
I... I deliver pizzas.

566
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:23,854
Yeah.

567
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:25,223
We cracked your code.

568
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:27,225
"Hoping to get
                      a delivery

569
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,060
"at Slauson and La Brea
        tomorrow night.

570
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:32,196
Enough pepperoni
   to feed a family of four."

571
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:34,432
The mafia, the cartels,

572
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:37,068
when they hear that
         we have you in custody,

573
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,604
and they think
   for a second about your...

574
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:42,073
ingenious pizza code,

575
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:44,442
they're gonna want
       to keep you quiet.

576
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:45,443
So, uh...

577
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:47,378
you can help me out, right?

578
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,380
Depends.
          (door opens)

579
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:52,450
Hmm! Hands off my
                client, Officer.

580
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:53,651
(door closes)

581
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:57,255
You're not his lawyer.

582
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:59,257
The accused has
          a constitutional right

583
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:02,293
to be counseled
        by whomever they choose.

584
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:03,527
She can be my lawyer.

585
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:08,032
I understand your confusion.

586
00:21:08,034 --> 00:21:09,634
You're very attractive.

587
00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:11,269
I've found that
                   can also mean

588
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:13,104
you're not very intelligent.

589
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:24,382
(chuckles)

590
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:27,652
I've already posted your bail.

591
00:21:27,654 --> 00:21:29,820
No. Wait, wait, wait.
     I-I can't afford that.

592
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:32,290
Oh, don't worry,
    I take payment in trade.

593
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:34,725
Is it true that you know
       how to make bombs?

594
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:38,496
That's what I'm accused of.

595
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:39,630
Yeah?

596
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,266
Have you ever brought down
       a building before?

597
00:21:42,268 --> 00:21:44,302
I know how it's done.

598
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:46,304
(laughs)

599
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:49,473
I need you to destroy
      a nightclub for me.

600
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,979
MOVER:
  Let's get out of here, guys.

601
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:56,280
Hands off...

602
00:21:56,282 --> 00:21:58,282
my piano!
MOVER:
Hey, man,

603
00:21:58,284 --> 00:22:00,284
we're just doing a job.
   We don't want any trouble.

604
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:02,186
You think you can come in here
     and take apart my life

605
00:22:02,188 --> 00:22:04,488
without any trouble?

606
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,923
You gentlemen

607
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:08,526
have no idea who you're
     dealing with, do you?

608
00:22:08,528 --> 00:22:09,794
Well...

609
00:22:09,796 --> 00:22:12,797
let me show you.

610
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,699
(cheering)
¶ Babe, show me what you like ¶

611
00:22:14,701 --> 00:22:17,668
¶ Ay, I put money,
    I can match it for you ¶

612
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,370
¶ I'm in this in all white ¶

613
00:22:19,372 --> 00:22:20,538
¶ Fit lookin' like a brick ¶

614
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:23,140
¶ And all them zippers
     on the jacket on you ¶

615
00:22:23,142 --> 00:22:25,142
¶ He got a thing
      for a Latin chick ¶

616
00:22:25,144 --> 00:22:26,711
¶ He wanna hear
    a little Spanish in me ¶

617
00:22:26,713 --> 00:22:30,147
¶ Ha, I told him it ain't --
        to practice it ¶

618
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:31,882
¶ I'm 'bout to fully
    up the status with it ¶

619
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:33,351
¶ Walk up with the clique
  and I ain't lookin like... ¶

620
00:22:33,353 --> 00:22:34,618
(woman moaning)

621
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,187
¶ I'm the opposite,
    and I'm the main event ¶

622
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:37,888
¶ And bossin' in it
   as the time been tickin' ¶

623
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:40,224
¶ I been ouchea playin' my
position I'm up out to get it ¶

624
00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:42,526
¶ And block the hit cuz
      somedays somedays ¶

625
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,895
This building was
supposed to be empty.

626
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:46,564
Oh, you know Lucifer, Mom.

627
00:22:46,566 --> 00:22:49,166
He wasn't gonna let
this place go without a fight.

628
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:50,735
Or a drink.

629
00:22:50,737 --> 00:22:52,570
This is what humans call

630
00:22:52,572 --> 00:22:53,637
a "sit-in."

631
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:56,374
What are you doing here?

632
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:58,175
Well, I was gonna blow
        the building up with C4.

633
00:22:58,177 --> 00:22:59,410
Mom, you can't.
                         I know.

634
00:22:59,412 --> 00:23:01,379
My client is a coward.

635
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:03,214
And very difficult to convince
 him to kill this many people.

636
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:04,548
No, Mom,

637
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,550
That's-that's not what I...
                I may be able to

638
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:08,552
use this to my advantage.

639
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:11,589
¶ I'm the main event and bossin'
in it as the time been tickin' ¶

640
00:23:11,591 --> 00:23:12,757
¶ I been ouchea
     playin' my position ¶

641
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:15,359
¶ I'm up out to get it
    and block the hit cuz ¶

642
00:23:15,361 --> 00:23:19,397
¶ Somedays somedays sometimes
    I want someone someone ¶

643
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:21,932
¶ To tell me
    I'm somewhat somewhat ¶

644
00:23:21,934 --> 00:23:26,404
¶ Doin alright doin alright
    somewhere somewhere... ¶

645
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:27,671
To what do I owe the honor

646
00:23:27,673 --> 00:23:29,407
of your presence?

647
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:31,575
I disagree with you
         wholeheartedly

648
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:33,511
about wanting to stay here.

649
00:23:33,513 --> 00:23:34,879
But a mother doesn't have to

650
00:23:34,881 --> 00:23:38,282
agree with her son
    in order to support him.

651
00:23:38,284 --> 00:23:40,251
So...

652
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:42,453
what is it exactly
    I'm supposed to sit in?

653
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:43,621
(laughs)

654
00:23:43,623 --> 00:23:45,289
Mum.

655
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:46,957
You're actually being
          a good mum.

656
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:49,460
We may have
our disagreements,

657
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:51,595
but you're still my son.

658
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:54,064
I don't want to lose you again.

659
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:55,399
(soft chuckle)

660
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:57,301
Oh! Doctor!

661
00:23:57,303 --> 00:24:00,070
Mum, this is my
           therapist, Dr. Linda.

662
00:24:00,072 --> 00:24:02,907
Doctor, this is my mom
     in a disturbingly hot body.

663
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:04,108
Lucifer,

664
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,109
I'm sure that sounds strange

665
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:06,710
to her human brain.

666
00:24:06,712 --> 00:24:08,612
Oh ,no, don't worry, Mum,
 Dr. Linda's had a crash-course

667
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:10,314
in celestial beings.

668
00:24:10,316 --> 00:24:12,249
Only melted her brain
for about a week.

669
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:13,651
(chuckles)

670
00:24:13,653 --> 00:24:14,485
Now, if you'll excuse me,

671
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:16,620
I have guests to get back to.

672
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:20,424
I'm sure you'll get
        on like a house on fire.

673
00:24:20,426 --> 00:24:22,293
¶ Doin alright somewhere ¶

674
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:25,996
¶ Somewhere I'll find me
    that someone, someone ¶

675
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:27,832
¶ Somebody that one day one day

676
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:29,467
¶ Could be the love
        of my life... ¶

677
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:31,669
So... you're, uh...

678
00:24:31,671 --> 00:24:33,070
God's wife.

679
00:24:33,072 --> 00:24:34,505
Ex-wife.

680
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:35,506
Oh.

681
00:24:35,508 --> 00:24:38,075
I prefer to not be
        defined by Him.

682
00:24:38,077 --> 00:24:40,644
Oh, of course, of course.

683
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:43,514
Well, I just want to say,

684
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:45,850
it's an honor to meet you.

685
00:24:45,852 --> 00:24:48,819
Thank you for...

686
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:53,524
for all of... this.

687
00:24:55,595 --> 00:24:57,628
Existence.
           (chuckles)

688
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:00,097
And I wanted to thank you

689
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:02,299
for taking such good care
           of my son.

690
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:05,302
You're so welcome.

691
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:08,038
Our relationship must give you
      a lot to talk about.

692
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,040
Mm.

693
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:15,379
I'm not telling you anything
      about our sessions.

694
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:22,219
¶ ¶

695
00:25:24,991 --> 00:25:29,360
Simon Halbrooks, of
Private Investigative Solutions.

696
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:30,861
That's my company.

697
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:32,129
Built it myself.

698
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:34,732
Hmm. Dean Cooper made several
         off-the-books

699
00:25:34,734 --> 00:25:37,134
six-figure payments to you
     in the last few weeks.

700
00:25:37,136 --> 00:25:39,737
Those payments were off of
    his books, not off mine.

701
00:25:39,739 --> 00:25:41,138
I'm legit.

702
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,306
What kind of legit business
          has clients

703
00:25:42,308 --> 00:25:43,574
hide their payments to you?

704
00:25:43,576 --> 00:25:45,142
Do you trust your fellow
      officers, Detective?

705
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:46,710
Excuse me?

706
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,579
Do you know for sure
     they wouldn't take a bribe?

707
00:25:48,581 --> 00:25:50,548
Rat you out for the right price?

708
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:53,384
How can you know who to trust?

709
00:25:53,386 --> 00:25:55,152
I'm the guy who answers
        those questions.

710
00:25:55,154 --> 00:25:56,587
And how do you do that?

711
00:25:56,589 --> 00:26:00,324
Think of me as
    a professional tempter.

712
00:26:00,326 --> 00:26:01,692
People hire me to find out

713
00:26:01,694 --> 00:26:04,094
if their R&D guy
             would sell secrets.

714
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:05,329
Or if a famous couple's nanny

715
00:26:05,331 --> 00:26:08,933
could be bribed for
    pictures of their kids.

716
00:26:08,935 --> 00:26:11,435
So whose loyalty were you
  testing at Cooper's company?

717
00:26:11,437 --> 00:26:12,603
That's privileged information.

718
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:17,942
I just thought you'd want
     to know, we got calls

719
00:26:17,944 --> 00:26:19,944
about some kind of an
     illegal party at Lux.

720
00:26:19,946 --> 00:26:21,445
¶ ¶

721
00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:23,647
Oh... thanks.

722
00:26:26,953 --> 00:26:28,919
(cheering)

723
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:36,727
(music stops, crowd booing)

724
00:26:36,729 --> 00:26:39,763
Oh!

725
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:41,865
Stormtroopers have arrived,
           everyone.

726
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:43,867
Don't worry,
I'll deal with the boys in blue.

727
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:45,703
You are the boys in blue,
          aren't you?

728
00:26:45,705 --> 00:26:48,405
The strippers aren't due
       for another hour.

729
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:49,707
(Lucifer chuckling,
   indistinct radio chatter)

730
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,743
Detective.

731
00:26:52,745 --> 00:26:54,578
What are you doing with them?

732
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,480
I know him.
       I'll handle this.

733
00:26:56,482 --> 00:26:57,615
You sure, Detective?

734
00:26:57,617 --> 00:26:58,882
CHLOE:
          I can reason with him.

735
00:26:58,884 --> 00:27:00,784
This doesn't need to be a scene,
I got it.

736
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:02,786
OFFICER:
           Okay, guys, let's go.

737
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:05,656
Thanks, guys.

738
00:27:09,895 --> 00:27:12,663
Lucifer, what the hell
       were you thinking?

739
00:27:13,766 --> 00:27:15,833
I...

740
00:27:15,835 --> 00:27:19,837
(quietly): Turn the music back
    on, this place is dead.

741
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:21,839
(chuckles)

742
00:27:21,841 --> 00:27:23,173
(chuckles)
Well, you heard the lady.

743
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:24,642
Crank it up!

744
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:26,010
¶ ¶
           (cheering)

745
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:28,178
Detective,

746
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,680
does that mean
     you're on my side now?

747
00:27:29,682 --> 00:27:33,017
Lucifer, this is your home,
 I've always been on your side.

748
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:34,451
Well,

749
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:35,986
if you're gonna stay,
come on, stay.

750
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:37,821
No, I don't want to dance.
            No, no, no, come on.

751
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:39,023
You're the guest of honor now.
I don't want to...

752
00:27:39,025 --> 00:27:40,324
Come on!

753
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:41,692
¶ Should I stay
      or should I go now ¶

754
00:27:41,694 --> 00:27:43,027
¶<i> Yo! ¿Me frío o lo soplo?</i> ¶

755
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:45,929
¶ Should I stay
      or should I go now ¶

756
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:47,631

757
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:49,833

758
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,436
¶<i> Si me voy,</i>
     <i> va a haber peligro</i> ¶

759
00:27:52,438 --> 00:27:55,272
¶ And if I stay
      it will be double ¶

760
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:56,874
¶<i> Si me quedo, es doble</i> ¶

761
00:27:56,876 --> 00:27:59,276
He really does love this place,
          doesn't he?

762
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:00,477
Yeah.

763
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:02,446
This place.

764
00:28:02,448 --> 00:28:04,682
¶<i> ¿Me frío o lo soplo?</i> ¶

765
00:28:04,684 --> 00:28:07,685

768
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,890
(faded): ¶<i> Si me voy,</i>

769
00:28:12,892 --> 00:28:14,725

¶<i> Si me quedo, es doble</i> ¶

771
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:19,563
My son was right about you,
            Doctor.

772
00:28:19,565 --> 00:28:20,898
You are

773
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,099
quite insightful.

774
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:28,072
(snoring,
    glass bottles rattling)

775
00:28:28,074 --> 00:28:29,239
Oh.

776
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:30,374
You know, for a moment there,

777
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:32,543
you were actually having fun,
           Detective.

778
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:33,744
Ooh.

779
00:28:33,746 --> 00:28:34,978
Obviously it was
       temporary insanity

780
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,348
as now you're back at work.

781
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,718
Well, as any parent knows
the best time to get things done

782
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,653
is when everyone else is asleep.

783
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:45,556
So, what have we got?

784
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:47,758
Well, I've been going
          through these payments

785
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,260
to our professional tempter,
       and none of them match up

786
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:53,530
to the timing of any
          of Cooper's new hires.

787
00:28:53,532 --> 00:28:56,600
I just can't figure out
    who they were investigating.

788
00:28:56,602 --> 00:28:59,169
Riveting, but I meant what have
we got to prevent my club

789
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:01,772
from being bulldozed
into a Cinnabon?

790
00:29:01,774 --> 00:29:05,375
Lucifer, I'm sorry but that
 trick that I pulled last night

791
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:06,910
is only gonna work once.

792
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:09,379
I can't see another
         way to save this place.

793
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:12,382
Well, then, we need to look
harder, Detective.

794
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:13,951
This is about more than me.

795
00:29:13,953 --> 00:29:16,553
I mean, do you know the
 history of sin in this place?

796
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:17,788
It was a, an institution

797
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:20,124
decades before I ran it.

798
00:29:20,126 --> 00:29:21,191
Th-that crack

799
00:29:21,193 --> 00:29:22,559
in that mirror there.

800
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:23,927
That crack is still there

801
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:27,030
from when Ava Gardner threw a
scotch glass at Sinatra's head.

802
00:29:27,032 --> 00:29:28,432
(chuckles)
                         Hmm.

803
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:31,201
Underneath here there's
prohibition tunnels everywhere.

804
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:33,203
Howard Hughes used to use them
to sneak his mistresses

805
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:35,572
away from his other mistresses.

806
00:29:35,574 --> 00:29:36,907
And that stool
that you're sitting on,

807
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:38,742
that very stool, Detective,

808
00:29:38,744 --> 00:29:40,144
this may disturb
and titillate you...

809
00:29:40,146 --> 00:29:41,779
We have to go see
          Simon Halbrooks again.

810
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:42,980
I think I know

811
00:29:42,982 --> 00:29:45,549
who he had Cooper looking into.
Well, I'm sorry,

812
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:47,417
I can't leave Lux undefended.

813
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:48,986
Really?

814
00:29:48,988 --> 00:29:49,987
Okay.

815
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:54,825
Eleanor Bloom's entire

816
00:29:54,827 --> 00:29:57,461
moving crew is
       passed out on your floor.

817
00:29:57,463 --> 00:30:01,064
The police aren't gonna be
  here for at least another day.

818
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:03,934
Lux is fine.

819
00:30:03,936 --> 00:30:06,436
I really need your help here.

820
00:30:06,438 --> 00:30:08,972
Really?

821
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:10,808
(ice cubes rattling in glass)

822
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:15,546
(laughter and
   indistinct conversations)

823
00:30:17,817 --> 00:30:22,586
You don't trust
            her, either, do you?

824
00:30:22,588 --> 00:30:24,021
It's not what you think, Maze.

825
00:30:24,023 --> 00:30:25,589
Listen,
  when I first came to Earth,

826
00:30:25,591 --> 00:30:27,858
I made certain mistakes,
           all right?

827
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,860
I'm just making sure Mom
  doesn't make the same ones.

828
00:30:29,862 --> 00:30:31,829
That's it.
      I'm protecting her.

829
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:33,664
(Maze chuckles)

830
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:34,865
Right.

831
00:30:34,867 --> 00:30:38,502
She didn't tell you who
       she was meeting, did she?

832
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:40,437
So who do you think it is, hmm?

833
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:41,839
An assassin?

834
00:30:41,841 --> 00:30:43,273
A terrorist?

835
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:46,376
I'm quite sure
it's no one so dramatic.

836
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:48,345
¶ ¶

837
00:30:51,617 --> 00:30:53,884
(exhaling)
                           Oh...

838
00:30:53,886 --> 00:30:56,820
I did not see that coming.

839
00:30:56,822 --> 00:30:59,289
¶ A little lime, little lime ¶

840
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:01,491
¶ Little sugar with the vodka
         on the side ¶

841
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:04,862
¶ Woo woo... ¶

842
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:05,863
I saw a sadness in you.

843
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:07,497
A sadness and a strength.

844
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:08,866
Look, I know this is

845
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:10,500
forward of me but...

846
00:31:10,502 --> 00:31:12,002
you want to grab
             a drink in my room?

847
00:31:12,004 --> 00:31:16,206
I mean I probably shouldn't.

848
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,875
Oh, you definitely shouldn't.

849
00:31:17,877 --> 00:31:19,409
I mean, I'm all for

850
00:31:19,411 --> 00:31:20,878
examining your
innermost desires,

851
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,480
but at least examine
your options first.

852
00:31:23,482 --> 00:31:24,915
Uh, hey, buddy.

853
00:31:24,917 --> 00:31:26,316
I'm working here.

854
00:31:26,318 --> 00:31:27,918
Indeed you are,
     in that it's literally

855
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,019
your job to seduce her,

856
00:31:29,021 --> 00:31:30,320
and report back to her fiancée's

857
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:31,722
wealthy parents.

858
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:33,924
Or am I wrong?

859
00:31:33,926 --> 00:31:36,059
(scoffs)
Mm.

860
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:38,095
Oh, something I said?

861
00:31:38,097 --> 00:31:40,330
You don't just tempt potential
employees, Simon.

862
00:31:40,332 --> 00:31:43,100
You also go after
potential spouses.

863
00:31:43,102 --> 00:31:44,534
Dean Cooper's payments started

864
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:47,004
to you just after his son
got engaged to Christi.

865
00:31:47,006 --> 00:31:48,338
Care to explain?

866
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:52,676
It's true.

867
00:31:52,678 --> 00:31:54,878
Old Man Cooper
didn't trust Christi.

868
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,179
She came from
        Nowheresville, Michigan,

869
00:31:56,181 --> 00:31:58,749
where they put cars
             on blocks in yards.

870
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:00,117
So Dean Cooper thought she was
     after his son's money,

871
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:02,753
and hired you to prove that
  she was just a gold digger?

872
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:04,121
And I approached her.

873
00:32:04,123 --> 00:32:07,124
Rented Bentley, fake
    Rolex, the whole nine yards.

874
00:32:07,126 --> 00:32:08,525
I laid it on thick.

875
00:32:08,527 --> 00:32:09,927
And? Did she sleep with you?

876
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:11,528
She passed.

877
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:12,963
She stayed faithful.

878
00:32:12,965 --> 00:32:14,965
What, you couldn't seduce
   her with your fake Rolex?

879
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:16,767
Well, color me shocked.
                      (chuckles)

880
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:19,036
Hey, man, my success rate
        is pretty high.

881
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:20,938
She was really in love
       with her fiancée.

882
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,940
It happens sometimes.

883
00:32:22,942 --> 00:32:25,142
So if she didn't cheat, then
what happened with Dean Cooper?

884
00:32:25,144 --> 00:32:26,376
I told the old man the truth.

885
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:27,945
But it didn't matter,
      he didn't like her.

886
00:32:27,947 --> 00:32:29,713
Even if there was no
       evidence of her cheating,

887
00:32:29,715 --> 00:32:33,550
he wanted me to... make some.

888
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:34,718
"Make some?"

889
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,119
I photoshopped pictures of her

890
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:38,021
in some compromising positions.

891
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:41,124
What?

892
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:42,960
It was a lot of money.

893
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:44,161
So Dean Cooper tried
      to blackmail Christi

894
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:45,595
into breaking off
         her engagement

895
00:32:45,597 --> 00:32:46,930
with fake proof of her cheating?

896
00:32:46,932 --> 00:32:49,566
That's some serious
motive for murder.

897
00:32:49,568 --> 00:32:51,168
LUCIFER:
The poor girl was
just trying to find

898
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,336
a place to belong.

899
00:32:52,338 --> 00:32:54,504
And you, you vile insect,

900
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:56,106
took that away from her.

901
00:32:56,108 --> 00:32:57,174
If you ask me,
   she killed the wrong man.

902
00:32:57,176 --> 00:32:58,809
Lucifer, come on.

903
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:00,010
All right.
Detective,

904
00:33:00,012 --> 00:33:02,579
this man is a
professional homewrecker!

905
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:03,647
And when it gets out,
        what he's done,

906
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:04,948
he will be out of business.

907
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:07,150
That will have to be
              punishment enough.

908
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:08,852
Please.

909
00:33:08,854 --> 00:33:11,088
Very well, Detective.

910
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:18,996
DAN:
      <i> I'm not gonna lie.</i>

911
00:33:18,998 --> 00:33:20,330
I was, um--

912
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:22,833
I was pretty surprised
             when you called me.

913
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:24,434
Even more surprised

914
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:26,003
you actually invited
              me out. (chuckles)

915
00:33:26,005 --> 00:33:29,139
You know, as soon as I walked
into that interrogation room,

916
00:33:29,141 --> 00:33:31,208
I felt a spark between us.

917
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:35,145
Yeah?

918
00:33:35,147 --> 00:33:36,680
Me, too.

919
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:38,382
I'm surprised
you're still single.

920
00:33:38,384 --> 00:33:41,218
(chuckling)
Lucky me.

921
00:33:43,122 --> 00:33:44,855
Look, I'm gonna be
                honest with you,

922
00:33:44,857 --> 00:33:46,456
I've been a little
                     bit gun-shy

923
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:48,025
about the whole dating thing.

924
00:33:48,027 --> 00:33:49,793
You know, since my split.

925
00:33:49,795 --> 00:33:52,195
No, I understand.

926
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:55,232
I went through
a bad breakup, myself.

927
00:33:55,234 --> 00:33:57,200
Honestly, I was in Hell

928
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:58,668
for what felt like forever.

929
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,237
(chuckles)

930
00:34:00,239 --> 00:34:02,139
I've only recently come back.

931
00:34:05,244 --> 00:34:07,644
What happened with you two?

932
00:34:07,646 --> 00:34:09,046
Was there someone else?

933
00:34:09,048 --> 00:34:10,247
No, no.

934
00:34:10,249 --> 00:34:12,249
No, nothing like that.

935
00:34:12,251 --> 00:34:13,683
But...

936
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:15,585
But?

937
00:34:16,688 --> 00:34:18,688
(sighs)

938
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:20,524
(smacks lips) Well,
           there's this-this guy

939
00:34:20,526 --> 00:34:22,492
that she spends
             a lot of time with.

940
00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:25,228
And he definitely has a
          thing for her, but I--

941
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:28,231
I mean, I don't know if
       it's reciprocated, but...

942
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:31,101
you know, I...
Go on.

943
00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:35,705
I think you were right, Maze.

944
00:34:35,707 --> 00:34:38,542
They must be discussing
some evil, terrible plans.

945
00:34:38,544 --> 00:34:40,043
And we must stop them.

946
00:34:40,045 --> 00:34:42,846
No, let's let it play out.

947
00:34:42,848 --> 00:34:44,514
Just to be safe.

948
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:45,482
(sighs)

949
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:50,087
Wow. You know,

950
00:34:50,089 --> 00:34:52,923
I haven't really
                had anyone to...

951
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:55,058
talk about my ex with.

952
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,927
And it feels really
             good to get it out.

953
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:59,729
Yes, it certainly does
clarify things.

954
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:01,698
Whoa, whoa, uh, wait,

955
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,699
I'm so sorry.

956
00:35:02,701 --> 00:35:04,468
I, um,

957
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:06,636
I totally over-shared,
                       didn't I?

958
00:35:06,638 --> 00:35:08,538
(chuckles softly)
                             I--

959
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,706
I haven't done
                this in a while.

960
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:11,274
And... (chuckles)

961
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:13,443
I screwed it up.

962
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:17,180
Well, I suppose I do
have some time and...

963
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:20,317
...you are fairly attractive.

964
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:23,220
(chuckling):
             What?

965
00:35:27,126 --> 00:35:28,792
Oh...
                      (chuckles)

966
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:34,564
(camera snaps)

967
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:37,067
(chuckling):
            Oh, that's a keeper.

968
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:39,336
Come on, let's go.

969
00:35:39,338 --> 00:35:40,737
I know where he lives.

970
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:42,772
I'm not gonna go watch
my mother make out with Dan!

971
00:35:42,774 --> 00:35:44,274
They're not gonna make out.

972
00:35:44,276 --> 00:35:46,476
They're gonna...
                         (moans)

973
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:48,945
I know what they're
gonna go do, Maze!

974
00:35:48,947 --> 00:35:50,981
Fine. I'll report back.

975
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:52,149
Maze, stop.

976
00:35:52,151 --> 00:35:53,783
This is just a...

977
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:55,785
an innocent date.

978
00:35:55,787 --> 00:35:57,187
An innocent date?

979
00:35:57,189 --> 00:35:59,689
With Chloe's ex?
Yeah, they're colleagues.

980
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:01,191
She was in Hell
    for thousands of years,

981
00:36:01,193 --> 00:36:03,326
and he's a good enough
        looking... guy.

982
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:04,995
Please don't make me
     explain this any more.

983
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:08,431
(giggles) But it is
  so much fun to torture you.

984
00:36:09,535 --> 00:36:11,334
Look,

985
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:13,203
I'm not gonna interfere
         with my mother

986
00:36:13,205 --> 00:36:15,772
enjoying a little bit
         of happiness.

987
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:17,707
Please.

988
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:22,512
Fine.

989
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:24,381
It's not like
   I wanted to watch, anyway.

990
00:36:24,383 --> 00:36:26,183
Even I have my limits.

991
00:36:26,185 --> 00:36:28,385
(chuckles)

992
00:36:44,203 --> 00:36:46,970
(phone dialing)

993
00:36:46,972 --> 00:36:48,071
It's me.

994
00:36:48,073 --> 00:36:50,740
Forget the building,
    I need a smaller charge.

995
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:53,243
For say, one person.

996
00:36:54,246 --> 00:36:56,179
Don't worry about that.

997
00:36:56,181 --> 00:36:58,481
I'm going to do this one myself.

998
00:37:09,895 --> 00:37:10,927
(doorbell rings)

999
00:37:12,998 --> 00:37:14,231
Mr. Cooper,
      sorry to bother you.

1000
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:16,333
We just have a
      few more questions.

1001
00:37:16,335 --> 00:37:18,034
Can your fiancée
vouch for your whereabouts

1002
00:37:18,036 --> 00:37:19,769
the morning
your father was killed?

1003
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:23,707
No, she was out looking
  for a venue for the wedding.

1004
00:37:23,709 --> 00:37:24,608
Why?

1005
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:26,409
Well...
CHRISTI:
What is this?

1006
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:28,278
I thought Eric had been
cleared of the charges.

1007
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,512
Oh, he has.

1008
00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:30,847
Because we now know
that you're the one

1009
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:32,015
who killed your
father-in-law, Christi.

1010
00:37:32,017 --> 00:37:33,416
What?

1011
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:35,218
CHLOE: Eric's father
created fake evidence

1012
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,519
that you were cheating
and tried to blackmail you

1013
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:37,520
into leaving.

1014
00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:38,688
And then he had

1015
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:41,391
a little champagne toast to evil
        while he did it.

1016
00:37:41,393 --> 00:37:43,093
No wonder you wanted to jam it
        down his throat.

1017
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:44,427
I...

1018
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:45,795
No.

1019
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:47,897
No, I did it.

1020
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:49,432
My father, he-he
     showed me the evidence

1021
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:52,035
and I knew it was fake.

1022
00:37:52,037 --> 00:37:54,037
Christi would never...

1023
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:56,273
And-and the fact that
          he would...

1024
00:37:56,275 --> 00:37:59,476
stoop so low,
    I couldn't help myself.

1025
00:37:59,478 --> 00:38:01,044
I flew into a rage.

1026
00:38:01,046 --> 00:38:02,612
Well, if that's the case,

1027
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:04,381
Eric Cooper, you're
                 under arrest...

1028
00:38:04,383 --> 00:38:05,382
No!

1029
00:38:06,718 --> 00:38:08,752
It was me.
                     It happened

1030
00:38:08,754 --> 00:38:10,053
all like you said.

1031
00:38:10,055 --> 00:38:11,321
Christi...

1032
00:38:11,323 --> 00:38:13,156
I'm-I'm the one
           who did it, not Eric.

1033
00:38:13,158 --> 00:38:14,391
I think he did it.

1034
00:38:14,393 --> 00:38:16,293
You two realize that if
      you confess to this crime,

1035
00:38:16,295 --> 00:38:17,827
there's a good chance you
           both will go to jail?

1036
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:21,498
Whatever we face,

1037
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,767
we face together.

1038
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:25,735
LUCIFER:
             I don't understand.

1039
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:29,005
The one of you who didn't do it,
    you'll lose everything.

1040
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:32,909
No, we won't.

1041
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:42,085
No one was willing
            to stand next to you

1042
00:38:42,087 --> 00:38:43,453
in front of the bulldozers?

1043
00:38:43,455 --> 00:38:45,855
(laughs)
              No.

1044
00:38:45,857 --> 00:38:47,357
No, I sent everybody home.

1045
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:48,758
(inhales deeply)

1046
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,095
Thought I'd say
my good-byes on my own.

1047
00:38:52,097 --> 00:38:54,097
Good-byes?

1048
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:55,665
I thought you were gonna
           fight for this place.

1049
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:58,535
Well, it occurred to me that

1050
00:38:58,537 --> 00:39:00,870
much as I love this place, uh,

1051
00:39:00,872 --> 00:39:03,673
I can always build a new one.

1052
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:05,375
I mean, it wasn't the walls
     that made it my home.

1053
00:39:05,377 --> 00:39:08,111
The people.

1054
00:39:08,113 --> 00:39:09,112
Yes.

1055
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:10,680
Well, the women.

1056
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:13,450
But they'll flock to any
    new place I go to, so...

1057
00:39:13,452 --> 00:39:14,484
Hmm.

1058
00:39:14,486 --> 00:39:19,422
Well, that makes this
          sort of anticlimactic.

1059
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:22,359
But Lux has been named
Mm.

1060
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:25,328
a Heritage Site
     by Los Angeles County.

1061
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:26,363
Detective, is this...

1062
00:39:26,365 --> 00:39:28,131
I had a friend
             in the city council

1063
00:39:28,133 --> 00:39:29,132
push it through.

1064
00:39:29,134 --> 00:39:30,400
And I used your, uh,

1065
00:39:30,402 --> 00:39:32,335
little history lesson
                 as inspiration.

1066
00:39:32,337 --> 00:39:34,137
Lux is protected now.

1067
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:36,806
It can't be demolished
        for development.

1068
00:39:36,808 --> 00:39:39,342
Detective, you...

1069
00:39:39,344 --> 00:39:41,711
(chuckles)

1070
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:44,581
you saved my home.

1071
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:46,149
Well, you'd still
             have to buy it back

1072
00:39:46,151 --> 00:39:48,752
from Eleanor Bloom, I'm sure
        well above market price.

1073
00:39:48,754 --> 00:39:50,987
But...
                         (sighs)

1074
00:39:50,989 --> 00:39:52,021
you can afford it.

1075
00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:52,989
(chuckles)

1076
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,726
I...

1077
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,528
I-I mean, I simply don't know
          what to say.

1078
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:00,363
I'm-I'm normally the one
       doing the favors.

1079
00:40:00,365 --> 00:40:02,265
And for a price.

1080
00:40:02,267 --> 00:40:04,334
Friends help
                 each other out.

1081
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:08,238
Yeah, well,

1082
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,540
let me at least
    buy you dinner tonight.

1083
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:11,541
To celebrate.

1084
00:40:11,543 --> 00:40:13,543
I know this
amazing steakhouse

1085
00:40:13,545 --> 00:40:15,745
and-and the chef's an absolute
artist in the kitchen.

1086
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:17,180
I mean, he's also
a degenerate gambler

1087
00:40:17,182 --> 00:40:18,114
and owes me a favor.

1088
00:40:19,618 --> 00:40:20,850
Otherwise, you'll just go home

1089
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:22,185
and eat one of those
poisonous sandwiches

1090
00:40:22,187 --> 00:40:24,454
you get from the vending machine
at work.

1091
00:40:24,456 --> 00:40:26,856
Come on, Detective.

1092
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:28,458
Friends help each other out.

1093
00:40:29,561 --> 00:40:31,394
<i> She saved Lux.</i>

1094
00:40:31,396 --> 00:40:33,396
No strings attached.

1095
00:40:33,398 --> 00:40:35,465
I-I didn't even ask.

1096
00:40:35,467 --> 00:40:36,766
LINDA: Well, Chloe
              saw that your home

1097
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:39,068
is a very important
                   place to you.

1098
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:41,271
Does it really surprise you

1099
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:42,639
that she'd want to
            help you protect it?

1100
00:40:42,641 --> 00:40:44,641
(scoffs)
           Well, I...

1101
00:40:44,643 --> 00:40:45,775
People make
              gestures like that

1102
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:47,210
all the time.

1103
00:40:47,212 --> 00:40:49,879
You just saw two people
   go to jail for each other.

1104
00:40:49,881 --> 00:40:51,714
But those people
      were clearly insane.

1105
00:40:51,716 --> 00:40:53,216
Now their home is a jail cell.

1106
00:40:53,218 --> 00:40:56,986
You realized earlier that "home"
  meant more to you than Lux.

1107
00:40:56,988 --> 00:40:58,621
That you could lose Lux

1108
00:40:58,623 --> 00:40:59,823
and still have
                   a place here.

1109
00:40:59,825 --> 00:41:01,458
Because Los Angeles is my home.

1110
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,892
Lux or no.

1111
00:41:02,894 --> 00:41:05,595
Are you sure that's what
  you were really looking for?

1112
00:41:05,597 --> 00:41:07,664
Well, what else would it be?

1113
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:09,232
Something occurred to me

1114
00:41:09,234 --> 00:41:10,633
when you introduced me
        to your mother.

1115
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:12,101
Why is it that

1116
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:13,837
I'm the only human in your life

1117
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,805
who knows who you really are?

1118
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:17,607
Because you asked me, remember?

1119
00:41:17,609 --> 00:41:19,576
You insisted that I show you.

1120
00:41:19,578 --> 00:41:22,345
Detective Decker has asked you
          many times.

1121
00:41:22,347 --> 00:41:23,813
And I always tell her the truth.

1122
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:25,515
But you know
    she doesn't believe you.

1123
00:41:25,517 --> 00:41:27,450
You could show her

1124
00:41:27,452 --> 00:41:29,519
your true face,

1125
00:41:29,521 --> 00:41:30,920
but you don't.

1126
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:34,324
Why is that?

1127
00:41:36,528 --> 00:41:38,027
Do you think
                    it's because

1128
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:40,263
you might be afraid

1129
00:41:40,265 --> 00:41:41,631
of how she might react?

1130
00:41:41,633 --> 00:41:43,533
Because you care

1131
00:41:43,535 --> 00:41:46,035
that much about
     what she thinks of you?

1132
00:41:46,037 --> 00:41:47,637
No, I-I-I'm sorry.

1133
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:49,038
Doctor,
   I don't really understand

1134
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,373
where you're going with this.

1135
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:52,842
I think you did come
                  to Los Angeles

1136
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:54,477
looking for something.

1137
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:57,280
But I also think
                 you've stopped.

1138
00:41:57,282 --> 00:42:00,116
Because maybe you've found it.

1139
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:05,188
¶ Devil devil ¶

1140
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,557
¶ Hmm ¶

1141
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:11,494
¶ Bones of metal metal ¶

1142
00:42:11,496 --> 00:42:14,531
¶ Hmm ¶

1143
00:42:14,533 --> 00:42:16,666
¶ You torture saints ¶

1144
00:42:16,668 --> 00:42:21,504
¶ With a single glance ¶

1145
00:42:21,506 --> 00:42:23,540
¶ You make them think ¶

1146
00:42:23,542 --> 00:42:27,577
¶ They ever stood a chance ¶

1147
00:42:27,579 --> 00:42:29,312
¶ Do not try me ¶

1148
00:42:29,314 --> 00:42:31,314
¶ Devil devil ¶

1149
00:42:31,316 --> 00:42:32,882
¶ Cannot buy me ¶

1150
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:35,184
¶ Devil devil ¶

1151
00:42:35,186 --> 00:42:38,688
¶ You won't make a fool of me ¶

1152
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:41,758
¶ Oh no ¶

1153
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,395
¶ What makes you
      so special special ¶

1154
00:42:45,397 --> 00:42:48,331
¶ To think I would ever settle ¶

1155
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:49,899
¶ Do not try me ¶

1156
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:51,601
¶ Devil devil ¶

1157
00:42:51,603 --> 00:42:53,336
¶ You cannot buy me ¶

1158
00:42:53,338 --> 00:42:54,604
¶ Devil devil ¶

1159
00:42:54,606 --> 00:42:58,775
¶ You won't make a fool of me ¶

1160
00:42:58,777 --> 00:43:00,710
¶ Oh no ¶

1161
00:43:00,712 --> 00:43:02,111
¶<i> Oh no</i> ¶

1162
00:43:02,113 --> 00:43:05,048
¶ What makes you
      so special special ¶

1163
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:07,717
(beeping)
¶ To think I would ever settle ¶

1164
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:11,454
¶ For that devious dance ¶

1165
00:43:11,456 --> 00:43:14,591
¶ Between me ¶

1166
00:43:14,593 --> 00:43:17,594
¶ And the devil devil. ¶
