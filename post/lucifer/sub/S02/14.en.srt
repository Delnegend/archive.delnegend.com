That you disappeared
after I almost died,

184
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:09,561
and then waltzed back in
married to a stripper?

185
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:11,396
Exotic dancer, but,
yes, I can explain.

186
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:12,397
No.

187
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,565
No need.

188
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:14,766
I'm happy for you.

189
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:15,767
Really.

190
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:16,902
Do you mind?

191
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:18,437
Sorry.

192
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,438
Am I bugging you?

193
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,439
I'm totally bugging you.

194
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:21,973
No, I love
that sound.

195
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:23,575
Oh.
LUCIFER:
Look, Detective,

196
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:25,076
I had some
family issues.

197
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:27,312
And I-I went to Vegas
to blow off some steam.

198
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:29,247
One thing led
to another, and...

199
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:31,817
Look, I am sorry, I should've
told you that I needed...

200
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:32,617
time off.

201
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:35,520
This isn't about vacation hours,

202
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:37,789
this isn't about time cards,
Lucifer, this...

203
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,326
How could you just...?

204
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:43,161
I thought
we were...

205
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:47,032
(voice breaking):
I thought we were friends.

206
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:49,801
Friends? Yes.

207
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,369
Friends, that's exactly
what we are.

208
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:52,571
Just friends.

209
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:55,707
Right.
Right.

210
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:56,808
So it's all
sorted then,

211
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,276
we'll go back to the way it was.
Great.

212
00:07:58,278 --> 00:07:59,277
You know, before...

213
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,278
Yes, I get it!

214
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,848
DAN:
Hey.
What?

215
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,916
I have Ash's ex-wife
in interrogation.

216
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:07,085
Great.

217
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:10,255
I...

218
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:12,190
That's classy,
dude.

219
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:13,959
Real classy.

220
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:16,695
Thank you?

221
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:19,364
You think they
like me?

222
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:21,533
Oh, what's not to like?

223
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:23,835
(Candy chuckling)

224
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:26,905
"Violent psycho bitch."

225
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:29,975
"Sid and Nancy,
except she's Sid."

226
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:34,412
"All she wanted was
to crush Ash's soul."

227
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:35,780
So, Courtney,

228
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:38,416
care to explain why all of
your ex-husband's bandmates

229
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:39,951
think you're capable of murder?

230
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:42,521
I had nothing to do with this.

231
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:44,556
Where were you the
night of Ash's death?

232
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:46,525
The same place I am
every night: work.

233
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:48,894
I have employees who
can vouch for it.

234
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:49,694
What do you do?

235
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,162
Run an online clothing company.

236
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:52,998
Built it from scratch.
Worked my ass off.

237
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,167
You want to know what Ash
would say about work?

238
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:57,669
"The world will provide."

239
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:59,137
But you know who did?

240
00:08:59,139 --> 00:08:59,938
Me.

241
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,507
Someone had to
be responsible.

242
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:04,943
The band, they thought
I was uncool,

243
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:09,548
but it was Ash, he was
the selfish, childish one.

244
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,550
I completely understand.

245
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:13,685
I was with an
immature partner,

246
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:14,853
and it was maddening.

247
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:16,154
It's crazy-making.

248
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:17,289
Yeah, wanted to kill him.

249
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:19,958
I didn't say that.

250
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:22,727
LUCIFER:
Ouch. Shade.

251
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,696
I wouldn't take
it too personally.

252
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,832
Yeah, right.

253
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:29,734
I'm sure it's not me
she's talking about.

254
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:32,938
Well, who else would
she be talking about?

255
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,539
CHLOE:
So, you want to explain

256
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,308
the domestic
abuse charge?

257
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,243
Look, we fought.

258
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,078
I'm not proud of that.

259
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,714
But I've paid for
my mistakes, literally.

260
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:43,815
What do you mean?

261
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,984
Ash took everything
when we divorced.

262
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:48,587
I agreed to sit down
with a divorce mediator,

263
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:51,056
and the guy was completely
biased against me.

264
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:52,624
I think him and Ash

265
00:09:52,626 --> 00:09:55,293
set up some sort of
shady side deal.

266
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:56,895
He's the real criminal.

267
00:09:56,897 --> 00:09:59,331
But if Ash got this
hefty divorce settlement,

268
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,333
then why was he couch-surfing?

269
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:02,334
Where'd the money go?

270
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:05,337
Maybe the mediator took it?

271
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:07,305
Like I said, the guy's a crook.

272
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:15,914
I got him.

273
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,649
Someone tagged Lucifer
at The Grove.

274
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:18,783
You're kidding.

275
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,486
Someone named "Cottoncandy86"?

276
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:22,887
That's an
unfortunate name.

277
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:25,357
No, Mom, it's an
Internet-- never mind.

278
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:29,527
It looks like they were getting
frozen yogurt to celebrate...

279
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:30,862
newlywed life?

280
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:33,732
#mrslucifer, #hottiehubby?

281
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:35,367
Are you speaking in tongues?

282
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:36,368
Mom!

283
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,636
Look.

284
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:40,338
He and cottoncandy86
are married.

285
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,141
What?!
He specifically told me
to watch over Chloe.

286
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,743
After everything that
we did to save her,

287
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:47,646
I don't... I don't understand.

288
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:49,114
Betrothing himself to that?

289
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:50,949
He wouldn't.

290
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:53,718
Perhaps Mazikeen was right.

291
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,954
Lucifer's concocting a plan.

292
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:59,924
♪ ♪

293
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:04,629
Well, Courtney's story
checked out.

294
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:06,631
She was working late
with two employees

295
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:07,932
at the time Ash was killed.

296
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:09,167
Courtney's been pointing
pretty hard

297
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,403
at their divorce mediator,
but I don't know.

298
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:12,637
Seems like a stretch.

299
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:14,706
Yeah, agreed, but I did
check it out anyways.

300
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:15,874
This guy named
Anthony Annan.

301
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:17,108
He's got a clean
record, and nothing

302
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,843
but Courtney's word
points to him.

303
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,112
Uh, Detective, a word?

304
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:22,113
You're still here?
Shouldn't you be

305
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:23,948
on some honeymoon
far, far away?

306
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,950
Oh, look, it's Mannequin Hair.

307
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:28,319
Who?
I don't know his name,

308
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:30,088
but he's in
the other photo, too.

309
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,524
Is that weird?
What other photo?

310
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:33,591
The one of the dead dude.

311
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:36,094
See? Right there.

312
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:36,995
Mannequin Hair is
in the crowd

313
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:38,997
behind the yellow tape.

314
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:40,231
She's right, it's him.

315
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:41,533
Unbelievable.

316
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:43,568
It's highly unlikely
for Ash's divorce mediator

317
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,503
to be lurking at the scene
of his murder, yes?

318
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:46,604
Yeah, very.

319
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:47,706
I'll track him down.
Nice.

320
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,874
Well done, Candy.

321
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,543
Well, I don't get a lot
of names at my job,

322
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:53,945
so I'm super good
with faces.

323
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:55,980
And other things.
Ah.

324
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:57,749
LUCIFER: This is fun, isn't it?
Isn't this fun?

325
00:11:57,751 --> 00:12:00,618
Hmm? Murder, suspects, clues.

326
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,287
Gosh, it feels good
to be back.

327
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:03,988
Right, I'm going to
call Candy a cab,

328
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,824
and then you and I can
get down to brass tacks, yes?

329
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:06,825
(pouty groan)

330
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:08,593
Actually,
come to think of it,

331
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:09,728
who watches over Trixie?

332
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:10,895
Do you want to go splitsies
on a nanny?

333
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,330
Besides, I hear this case
involves a band,

334
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:14,382
so, lucky for you

335
00:12:14,383 --> 00:12:16,433
I bring my much-needed
musical expertise.

336
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:17,936
Did you know
he plays piano?

337
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:19,938
Like, better than
Elton Tom.

338
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,406
I know plenty about
music, thank you.

339
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,274
(laughs)
Do you, now, Detective?
Mm-hmm.

340
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:24,576
Right, what's your
favorite band, then?

341
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:27,045
Hmm?
Hey...

342
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:29,481
(laughs):
Oh, full of '90s jams, I see.

343
00:12:29,483 --> 00:12:31,649
The Bangles, N'Sync,

344
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:33,318
Right Said Fred?

345
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,153
Give me the phone back.
I mean, seriously,
Detective,

346
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:36,421
your music queue
alone is enough

347
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,022
to disqualify you
from this case.

348
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:40,658
You're not the one who's
<i> on</i> this case, Lucifer.

349
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,795
What? But what about
our partnership?

350
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:46,698
Our partnership ended
when you ghosted me

351
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,633
and the entire department.

352
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:50,567
You can't just march back
in here like nothing's wrong.

353
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,238
You can't just grab
what you want when you want.

354
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:58,243
I'll just put that
down there, then.

355
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,917
You let me down, Lucifer.

356
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,621
I mean, what good
is a partner

357
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,189
if I can't depend on you?

358
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:14,926
I don't need you anymore.

359
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:17,796
Well, surely
you don't mean that.
I do.

360
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,397
You can go.

361
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,065
Both of you.

362
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:25,503
Right.

363
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:32,343
I haven't seen you
in a while, Lucifer.

364
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:34,913
Uh, I know you've
been through Hell.

365
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:38,449
I suppose we can
discuss that another time.

366
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:41,486
Oh, no, no, there's no need
for censoring, Doctor.

367
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,888
Candy and I have no secrets.

368
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,257
Isn't that the key
to a successful marriage?

369
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:51,462
And how are you coping
since your... travels?

370
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:54,432
Any warning signs
of lasting trauma?

371
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:55,567
Denial?

372
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:58,436
Rash decisions?

373
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,371
Um... no, no.

374
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:02,807
I think I've thought through
everything quite carefully.

375
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:05,243
He's a thinker, this one!

376
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:08,213
And, uh... and what
about Detective Decker?

377
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:10,315
I thought you two
had become...

378
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:12,817
close.

379
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:15,019
Well, everything
I felt for her

380
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:18,223
was smoke and mirrors,
courtesy of dear old Dad.

381
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:20,291
I mean, He clearly
expected me to zig,

382
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:21,759
and so I zagged.

383
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:25,997
And does Chloe know
that you've<i> zagged</i> Candy?

384
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:27,365
(giggles)
Yes.

385
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,466
She just fired me.

386
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:30,134
Shocking.
I know.

387
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:33,605
But if you felt
so manipulated...

388
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:35,740
why return to Chloe at all?

389
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:37,876
Well, I mean,
I tried to leave,

390
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:42,447
but I just felt
that I missed...

391
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:43,748
my work.

392
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,351
Look, anyway,
baby, bathwater,

393
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:48,419
the detective and I are
quite the crime-fighting duo.

394
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:49,821
I mean, you wouldn't
break up

395
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:51,456
Batman and Robin,
now, would you?
No.

396
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,124
We have a job to do.

397
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:55,093
So if she could
just see sense...

398
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:57,028
I was fired once.

399
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,563
But you know what I did?

400
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:01,199
I just kept showing up and
made myself expandable.

401
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:03,268
Oh, uh, do you mean
indispensable?

402
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:06,104
No. Expandable.
I got a boob job,

403
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:08,306
and it totally
expanded my horizons.

404
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:10,041
Because then, I
could do something

405
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:11,709
none of the other
girls could do.

406
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:12,710
You wanna see?

407
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:14,245
Ooh, yes.
No.

408
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,047
No?

409
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:18,049
But you know, the part
about showing up...

410
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:21,653
that's not, actually,
bad advice.

411
00:15:21,655 --> 00:15:22,820
It's called "acting as if."

412
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:26,591
Yes. Yes,
well done, Candy.

413
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:29,460
I think I know exactly
how to get back on the case.

414
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:31,062
Oh, gosh, I wish I'd
talked to you earlier.

415
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:32,363
Saved myself a trip.

416
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:33,865
(both chuckling)

417
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:34,899
LUCIFER:
Have a candy, Candy.

418
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:37,001
(squeals, chuckles)

419
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:40,371
DAN:
<i> Bad news, Chloe.</i>

420
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:42,807
Ash's mediator won't talk.

421
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:45,143
Well, because he's a lawyer.

422
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,813
Yep, not without a warrant.

423
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:51,149
Okay, will do.

424
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:52,717
I know you're there.

425
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:54,285
I'm a cop, Lucifer.

426
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,955
You think I don't know
when I'm being followed?

427
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:59,357
(sighs) All right,
fair enough.

428
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:01,793
Look, I'm simply here
to help with the case.

429
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:04,495
What, you mean the case
that Chloe kicked you off of?

430
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:07,098
I'm just... I'm trying
to put things back

431
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,666
the way they were, Dan.

432
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,638
Yeah, I've been there.

433
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:18,409
Right. And I have
a brilliant idea.

434
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:20,211
You expect me to let you
go undercover

435
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:21,546
with your stripper wife?

436
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:23,114
Right. First of all,
she's an exotic dancer.

437
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:24,248
"Stripper" is pejorative.

438
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,718
Well, far be it from me
to disrespect your bride.

439
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,086
Thank you.
And secondly,

440
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:30,221
Candy is a natural
at getting men to talk.

441
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:32,724
CHLOE:
Oh, I bet she is.

442
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:34,158
Awesome.

443
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,728
Lucifer has outdone himself.

444
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:39,697
Thanks.

445
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:41,265
Mm-hmm.

446
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:43,735
LUCIFER:
But, Detective,
the mediator

447
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:45,103
won't talk to you
without a warrant.

448
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:47,872
Which is why I so wisely made
an appointment for Candy and I

449
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:49,807
this afternoon, see?

450
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:50,875
You need me.

451
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:52,643
Let me think about that.
No.

452
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:54,512
Uh, Detective, if I
didn't know better,

453
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:57,181
I'd say you were prejudiced
against exotic dancers.

454
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,883
Okay, we're done here.

455
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:00,018
Good-bye.
But...

456
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,352
Come on, Candy.

457
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,154
Well, look,
if you change your mind

458
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:05,156
and wish to take me up
on this splendid lead,

459
00:17:05,158 --> 00:17:06,891
then, you know,
you can always text me,

460
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:08,526
or I'm on Wobble now as well.

461
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:11,763
You can get Candy
on Cottoncandy86.

462
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:20,304
♪ Take a good look
at the world around you ♪

463
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:24,575
♪ All the filth and hate
does it astound you? ♪

464
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:27,812
It was a marvelous idea.
I'm sure she'll come around.

465
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:29,013
MOM:
So it's true.

466
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:30,915
You're back.

467
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:34,285
Oh, invading my privacy,
as usual, I see.

468
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:36,821
Your brother and I
were worried sick.

469
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:39,724
You could have at least called.

470
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:42,794
Oh, my gosh, are you
Lucifer's sister?

471
00:17:42,796 --> 00:17:43,828
Oh!

472
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,530
Oh, Lucifer,
don't be rude.

473
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:48,032
Who is your
top-heavy friend?

474
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:52,070
Candy, darling,
this is my mother.

475
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:55,339
Mum, this is Candy,
my wife.

476
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:57,542
I'm sorry that we didn't
invite you to the wedding.

477
00:17:57,544 --> 00:17:58,576
We just decided

478
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:01,145
no enemies.

479
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:05,817
Well, lovely to meet you.

480
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:08,119
You're Lucifer's<i> mom?</i>

481
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:12,256
Oh, my gosh,
you look amazing!

482
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,058
I should start
using sunscreen.

483
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,560
A shame he kept you hidden.

484
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:17,695
I hate secrets.

485
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:22,433
Do you like shopping?

486
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:23,501
<i> Do</i> I?

487
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:28,339
I want to hear all
about you and Lucifer.

488
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:32,143
You two must have
so many plans.

489
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:33,978
So...

490
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:38,382
what do we
think of Candy?

491
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:44,322
Well, I think she's
perfect for Lucifer.

492
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:47,892
Her bra size equals
her IQ, huh?

493
00:18:47,894 --> 00:18:49,560
That's generous.

494
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,801
See that vein popping
out the side of your neck?

495
00:18:56,803 --> 00:19:00,271
Same thing happens when I
throw the dishes in the trash

496
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:03,641
instead of washing them.

497
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,143
You're mad.

498
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:08,279
I'm an idiot.

499
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:12,250
Look, I know Lucifer
better than anyone, okay,

500
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:13,684
and he does this sometimes.

501
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:17,255
Disappears, does stupid,
impulsive things.

502
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:20,725
But he always comes
back around, Chloe.

503
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:23,594
Yeah, but this time
I don't want him to.

504
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:27,331
I'm serious, I am done.
I'm done.

505
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,901
But he did get you an
in with that mediator.

506
00:19:29,903 --> 00:19:32,303
That's a good thing, right?

507
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:33,437
Yeah, well, I don't care.

508
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:34,639
There's no way
I'm letting him

509
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:37,909
and his exotic-dancer wife
on my case, or any case.

510
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:42,547
Maybe you and Lucifer
need a mediator.

511
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:45,917
(sighs)

512
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,252
Just saying.

513
00:19:57,597 --> 00:20:00,531
ANTHONY:
So, Mrs. Morningstar...

514
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:03,901
Oh, no, no, no, no,
you can call me Candy.

515
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:12,543
Candy, why do you want
to divorce Lucifer?

516
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,178
Um...

517
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:17,748
Well, I just feel like we're
supposed to have a partnership,

518
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:22,053
and it just totally feels
like it's not working anymore.

519
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:24,055
Mm-hmm. And you two have
been married for...

520
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:26,424
Five days.
Ever!

521
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:27,925
Forever.
Five days.

522
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:29,794
LUCIFER: Five days.
It feels like it.

523
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:30,895
But we've been through
a lot in that time,

524
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:32,396
and I say that we
work brilliantly together,

525
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:33,431
don't we, sweetie?

526
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:35,032
(laughs)
Well...

527
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:37,401
if you're talking
about the bedroom, yeah.

528
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:38,135
I mean, thank God

529
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:40,805
this bod is made
for pure sex,

530
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:42,106
because, clearly,

531
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:43,674
(whispering):
it's all he cares about.

532
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:46,143
I'm tired.

533
00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:47,345
Eh...

534
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:50,681
Would you say that's the, uh,
the crux of your issue?

535
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:51,782
Oh, the crux
of the issue?

536
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:53,217
Oh, no, no, no,
that would he Lucifer

537
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:55,353
disappearing, and
then popping back up

538
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:58,356
with zero explanation and
a ditzy bimbo on his arm.

539
00:20:58,358 --> 00:21:02,193
He's cheated on you
in five days of marriage?

540
00:21:02,195 --> 00:21:04,262
No, of course I didn't.
I've been completely faithful.

541
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:06,497
I take the vows of marriage
very seriously.

542
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:09,533
And that's why you chose
an idiotic, bedazzled<i> tweener</i>

543
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:10,735
as your partner.

544
00:21:10,737 --> 00:21:11,836
ANTHONY:
I'm sorry, Candy,

545
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:12,970
there's no name calling in here.

546
00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:15,573
Even if it's to yourself.

547
00:21:16,576 --> 00:21:17,808
Lucifer,

548
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,443
would you like to respond?

549
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:20,978
(scoffs)

550
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,181
This is gonna be hard for you
to understand, but...

551
00:21:24,183 --> 00:21:26,651
I've been through Hell recently.

552
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:28,919
Both figuratively and literally.

553
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:30,988
True torment,
my greatest fears realized.

554
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,624
Lucifer,
I am the one who almost died.

555
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:37,461
Yes, I know.
That is what I'm talking about.

556
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:39,897
(sighs)
Wow.

557
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:43,968
I almost believe you care.

558
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,337
Have you ever known me to lie?

559
00:21:49,776 --> 00:21:52,076
I don't know.

560
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:56,147
I don't know.

561
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:58,416
Why don't we take five?

562
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:07,792
(Anthony clears throat)

563
00:22:07,794 --> 00:22:09,927
Are you okay, Mrs. Morningstar?

564
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:13,564
(sighs)

565
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:17,635
Yeah, I'm...
yeah, thank you. I am.

566
00:22:17,637 --> 00:22:19,170
(chuckles)
Um...

567
00:22:20,473 --> 00:22:25,343
I, uh, I had heard
through a friend that...

568
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:31,282
you were open to
a little extra negotiation.

569
00:22:31,284 --> 00:22:34,919
Um, I'm not sure
what you mean by that.

570
00:22:34,921 --> 00:22:38,022
Um, well, my husband, you see,

571
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:39,890
has a lot of money.

572
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:42,059
And so, if you were to...

573
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:44,895
swing things my way,

574
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:48,265
then I'd make it
worth your while.

575
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:49,967
Wow...

576
00:22:51,504 --> 00:22:52,903
(chuckles)

577
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:55,172
You're really
something.

578
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:57,675
But that would be
crossing a line.

579
00:22:57,677 --> 00:22:59,110
And I can't do things like that.

580
00:22:59,112 --> 00:23:00,244
LUCIFER:
Why not?

581
00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:02,380
You did with
Ash Corrigan.

582
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:04,081
You two are in on this together?

583
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:06,417
No, we're...
Oh, yes.

584
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,686
(Chloe sighs)

585
00:23:08,688 --> 00:23:10,087
LAPD.

586
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:14,625
We know about your side deal
with Ash Corrigan.

587
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:16,527
Didn't pilfer enough money
from Ash's ex?

588
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:19,263
Had to go and kill Ash
to get the rest of the spoils?

589
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:22,500
Whoa.
I would never, ever hurt Ash.

590
00:23:22,502 --> 00:23:24,835
Then what did you want
to accomplish, Anthony?

591
00:23:24,837 --> 00:23:26,804
Hmm? Come on.

592
00:23:26,806 --> 00:23:28,205
Tell me.

593
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:31,175
What did you desire?

594
00:23:31,978 --> 00:23:33,444
I wanted...

595
00:23:33,446 --> 00:23:36,247
Yes?

596
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:39,950
I wanted the Heavy Woolies
to be the hugest band ever.

597
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:42,720
But... oh.
(chuckles)

598
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:44,588
ANTHONY:
Um...

599
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,490
Okay, yeah, yes,
I helped Ash in the divorce

600
00:23:46,492 --> 00:23:47,992
and I got him all
of Courtney's money.

601
00:23:47,994 --> 00:23:50,327
But there was no side deal,
'cause I did it for free.

602
00:23:51,564 --> 00:23:53,798
I did it for the band.

603
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,166
I did it for the music.

604
00:23:55,168 --> 00:23:56,267
(chuckles)
So,

605
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:57,168
you're a fan?

606
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:59,703
No, no, no. I was the manager.

607
00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:02,406
At least, Ash promised me...

608
00:24:02,408 --> 00:24:04,442
maybe I could be the manager
someday.

609
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:06,444
The point is,
I helped them a lot.

610
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:09,346
Ash and I
came up with a plan.

611
00:24:10,516 --> 00:24:12,883
(Lucifer laughs)
Buy all the albums himself

612
00:24:12,885 --> 00:24:15,186
using his ex-wife's money
to inflate sales.

613
00:24:15,188 --> 00:24:17,188
Talk about self-promotion.

614
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,889
All they needed
was a little nudge.

615
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:20,458
And it worked.

616
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,059
I mean, we got on the charts

617
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:24,462
and we started
getting radio play,

618
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:26,030
we were gonna be booked
for this big tour.

619
00:24:26,032 --> 00:24:28,299
I mean, we were gonna
make it so big.

620
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:31,202
We have a photo
linking you to the crime scene.

621
00:24:31,204 --> 00:24:32,336
Why were you there?

622
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:33,771
I was looking for them
after the gig,

623
00:24:33,773 --> 00:24:35,940
'cause Ash and Marla,
they were fighting.

624
00:24:35,942 --> 00:24:37,508
The bassist?
Why were they fighting?

625
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,742
When weren't they
fighting?

626
00:24:38,744 --> 00:24:40,878
I thought that Ash was gonna
kick Marla out of the band

627
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,314
that night after the gig,
so I went down there

628
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:44,782
to see how it went down.

629
00:24:46,586 --> 00:24:48,719
That's when I saw the police
standing there,

630
00:24:48,721 --> 00:24:50,921
across the street.

631
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:52,523
Over his dead body.

632
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:57,094
It was the night the music died.

633
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:00,331
(Lucifer scoffs)

634
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:04,401
Perhaps Marla didn't want to be
the fifth Beatle.

635
00:25:05,938 --> 00:25:07,905
Looks like we have
a new suspect.

636
00:25:07,907 --> 00:25:10,040
Oh, well, if that's the case,
then you're welcome, Detective.

637
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:11,542
It's nice to be needed.

638
00:25:11,544 --> 00:25:12,843
Look, go home.

639
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:14,445
Trust me.

640
00:25:14,447 --> 00:25:16,280
Candy needs you more than I do.

641
00:25:19,585 --> 00:25:21,619
(sighs)

642
00:25:21,621 --> 00:25:23,087
(chuckles awkwardly)

643
00:25:25,091 --> 00:25:26,490
Mine's bigger, right?

644
00:25:26,492 --> 00:25:29,827
Yes. Does that mean anything?

645
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:31,896
Just how much
Lucifer loves me.

646
00:25:31,898 --> 00:25:34,965
Ah, so these small ones are for
couples who don't really care.

647
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:36,100
Exactly.

648
00:25:36,102 --> 00:25:37,368
Tell me more

649
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,602
about you and Lucifer.

650
00:25:38,604 --> 00:25:41,305
What comes next for
you two lovebirds?

651
00:25:42,108 --> 00:25:43,407
Did he say anything

652
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:46,744
about-- oh, I don't
know... matricide?

653
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:49,880
No, I think the mattress
in the penthouse is pretty new.

654
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,649
Oh, come on, Candy.

655
00:25:51,651 --> 00:25:54,818
I know you two have
some kind of plan.

656
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:58,756
Well, you're right about that.

657
00:25:58,758 --> 00:26:00,224
So many plans.

658
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:02,726
Tell me everything.

659
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:08,299
Someday...

660
00:26:08,301 --> 00:26:10,000
...I want to open
my own juice bar.

661
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:11,168
Or a tanning salon.

662
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,903
Or a combo juice bar

663
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,204
and tanning salon.
(gasps)

664
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:15,406
You're speaking

665
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:18,275
and yet I don't
understand a single word.

666
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:20,511
I get that a lot.

667
00:26:20,513 --> 00:26:22,246
Why don't you talk
and I'll listen?

668
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:23,447
I'm a good listener.

669
00:26:23,449 --> 00:26:24,448
Like right now? I know exactly

670
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:25,683
what you're trying to say.

671
00:26:25,685 --> 00:26:27,318
But I didn't...
You want what's best

672
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,852
for your son
and you'll do anything

673
00:26:28,854 --> 00:26:31,238
to make sure he's happy.

674
00:26:31,239 --> 00:26:33,623
I want you to know,
I got Lucifer's back.

675
00:26:33,626 --> 00:26:34,792
And yours.

676
00:26:34,794 --> 00:26:35,993
Because...

677
00:26:35,995 --> 00:26:38,495
you're<i> my</i> mom now, too.

678
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:42,166
We're family.
(laughs)

679
00:26:43,002 --> 00:26:44,268
(giggles)

680
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,869
MOM:
<i> She's a sinister</i>

681
00:26:45,871 --> 00:26:46,904
genius.

682
00:26:46,906 --> 00:26:49,440
Mother, come on now.

683
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:51,742
Here I thought this "Candy"
was an insipid dullard.

684
00:26:51,744 --> 00:26:54,745
But she may be
the most formidable opponent

685
00:26:54,747 --> 00:26:56,513
I've ever faced.

686
00:26:57,316 --> 00:26:59,416
I came away
with nothing!

687
00:26:59,418 --> 00:27:01,051
Not a single crumb
of information

688
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:02,586
about Lucifer's real agenda.

689
00:27:02,588 --> 00:27:04,788
What if there is no
hidden agenda, Mom?
Oh...

690
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,423
What if this Candy's

691
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:08,058
exactly who she seems?

692
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,860
Then...
(scoffs)

693
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:12,129
...I don't understand
what Lucifer's doing.

694
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:14,465
Whatever he wants, as usual.
So he really just married

695
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:17,201
this preening mouth breather
because he likes her?

696
00:27:17,203 --> 00:27:18,736
Please.

697
00:27:18,738 --> 00:27:22,539
Only a deeply damaged soul
would make such a poor choice.

698
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:24,942
(sighs)

699
00:27:25,945 --> 00:27:28,345
Unless...

700
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:30,881
he really is that far gone.

701
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:34,084
Then that would mean
that my son

702
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:36,720
is really, truly broken.

703
00:27:36,722 --> 00:27:38,722
And I'm the one that broke him.

704
00:27:38,724 --> 00:27:39,823
Mom...

705
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:40,958
don't.

706
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,359
I manipulated him.

707
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:45,362
I pushed him too hard.

708
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:48,832
I did this.

709
00:27:51,404 --> 00:27:54,271
I'm a terrible mother.

710
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:01,211
DAN: Public intoxication,
vandalism.

711
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:02,913
Okay, Marla does have
a few priors.

712
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:05,416
But all par for the course
for a wannabe rock star.

713
00:28:06,252 --> 00:28:08,252
How'd you get the lead?

714
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,188
I got in to see the mediator.

715
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,923
Lucifer did a thing.

716
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:15,125
Yes, I knew you guys
would patch things up.

717
00:28:15,127 --> 00:28:16,260
Nope.

718
00:28:16,262 --> 00:28:17,628
Not even close.

719
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:18,962
(whispering):
Not even close.

720
00:28:18,964 --> 00:28:20,998
Well, it sounds like
he's trying to help.

721
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,266
Why are you rooting for him?

722
00:28:22,268 --> 00:28:23,400
I'm not rooting for him.

723
00:28:23,402 --> 00:28:24,635
Okay, anyhow,

724
00:28:24,637 --> 00:28:26,937
to me, Marla reads like
a troublemaker, not a killer.

725
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:30,774
Oh, unless you count crimes
against fashion.

726
00:28:30,776 --> 00:28:32,009
Yikes.

727
00:28:32,011 --> 00:28:33,010
(chuckles)

728
00:28:33,012 --> 00:28:34,311
Hey, guys.

729
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:37,614
Remember those marks
on Ash's head?

730
00:28:39,685 --> 00:28:41,618
You think they came from
the knobs on Marla's bass?

731
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,520
I mean, I still have to do
further tests,

732
00:28:43,522 --> 00:28:45,556
but it sure looks like<i> Tetris</i>
to me.

733
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:46,924
Okay, maybe Marla's our girl.

734
00:28:46,926 --> 00:28:49,359
We got to find her
and find that instrument.

735
00:28:50,162 --> 00:28:53,764
(electric guitar riff playing)

736
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:58,469
Yeah, I spoke to her roommate.

737
00:28:58,471 --> 00:29:00,637
She said Marla's here somewhere.

738
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:01,438
Yeah.

739
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,173

00:29:43,249 --> 00:29:46,116
This next song is for a,
uh, a special someone.

759
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:49,987

she doesn't need me anymore.

Yeah.

Well, I say she's wrong.

763
00:29:53,926 --> 00:29:57,327
And I'm gonna prove
just what I'm willing to do

764
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:58,629
for our partnership.

765
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:02,666

is Marla. Has
anyone seen Marla?

785
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:08,599
We're looking for
someone called Marla.

786
00:31:08,601 --> 00:31:10,701
I know she's here tonight.

787
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:12,402
She's the bass player.

788
00:31:12,404 --> 00:31:13,570
Ah, there she is!

789
00:31:13,572 --> 00:31:15,772
Marla! Will you bring
her up to the front?

790
00:31:17,676 --> 00:31:21,178
Come on. Marla, everybody.

791
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,679
(laughs)

792
00:31:22,681 --> 00:31:23,814
(song concludes)

793
00:31:23,816 --> 00:31:27,651
See? You need me.

794
00:31:32,892 --> 00:31:34,725
That better not be
Marla's bass.

795
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:36,059
It's already been processed.

796
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,928

Okay,

801
00:31:45,271 --> 00:31:47,271
it was wiped down pretty good,
but...

802
00:31:47,273 --> 00:31:50,107
I found traces of Ash's blood
on the tuning knobs.

803
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:51,608
LUCIFER: What, so
Marla's the killer?

804
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:53,510
Murder solved!
(laughs)

805
00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:54,912
And I believe that proves

806
00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:57,147
just how much
the department needs me.

807
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,349
Including you.

808
00:32:03,022 --> 00:32:05,522
Uh, we got a stalker,
which is normally bad,

809
00:32:05,524 --> 00:32:07,057
but makes me
very happy right now

810
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:09,059
'cause I was getting
very uncomfortable.

811
00:32:11,764 --> 00:32:14,898
What on Earth does he want?

812
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:17,935
You know I watched
over Chloe for weeks

813
00:32:17,937 --> 00:32:19,369
after you disappeared, right?

814
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:21,271
Angel or creeper, brother?

815
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,923
It's a fine line.

816
00:32:22,924 --> 00:32:24,574
You asked me to guard her,
so I did. Like an idiot!

817
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,977
You see, because I thought
that she meant something to you.

818
00:32:26,979 --> 00:32:27,911
(scoffs)

819
00:32:27,913 --> 00:32:29,379
We both know she's special.

820
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:32,015
Oh. That she is.

821
00:32:32,017 --> 00:32:34,151
A whoopee cushion sent from Dad.

822
00:32:34,153 --> 00:32:36,720
I'm sure he's having
a right old laugh at the moment.

823
00:32:36,722 --> 00:32:40,390
Right. So that means it's okay
to turn your back on Chloe?

824
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:42,426
Just ignore her feelings?

825
00:32:42,428 --> 00:32:44,161
Feelings she had
no control over.

826
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:45,696
Feelings that aren't real.

827
00:32:45,698 --> 00:32:46,797
But she doesn't know that.

828
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:50,400
Which is why I had
to save her from...

829
00:32:51,437 --> 00:32:53,737
From you.

830
00:32:57,209 --> 00:32:59,009
You're not ignoring Chloe,
you're protecting her

831
00:32:59,011 --> 00:33:00,544
because she had no choice.

832
00:33:00,546 --> 00:33:02,980
So I gave it back to her.

833
00:33:02,982 --> 00:33:05,916
By holding up a shield
made of Candy.

834
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,287
I'm sorry, Lucifer.

835
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:13,523
(sighs)

836
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:17,227
You should at least explain
some of this to Mom.

837
00:33:17,229 --> 00:33:18,996
She's upset.

838
00:33:18,998 --> 00:33:21,064
Good.

839
00:33:21,066 --> 00:33:24,368
She died and went to Hell
for you, Luci.

840
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:25,769
For you.

841
00:33:25,771 --> 00:33:27,371
She faced her greatest fears

842
00:33:27,373 --> 00:33:28,572
all because she loves you.

843
00:33:28,574 --> 00:33:29,706
Oh, come on.

844
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:31,408
Yes, she hurt you.

845
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:34,578
But she was just doing what
she thought was best for you.

846
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,246
And from what you just told me,

847
00:33:36,248 --> 00:33:38,615
I'm quite sure
you can relate to that.

848
00:33:38,617 --> 00:33:41,051
Come on.

849
00:33:41,854 --> 00:33:45,288
What more does it take?

850
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:54,898
(sighs)

851
00:33:56,035 --> 00:33:58,001
You really told Lucifer
where I was?

852
00:33:58,003 --> 00:34:00,137
Since when do you guys talk?

853
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:02,873
Since he helped me
save your life.

854
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:04,608
I didn't kill Ash.

855
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:06,009
Innocent people don't run.

856
00:34:06,011 --> 00:34:08,612
Or get a dead guy's blood
on their guitars.

857
00:34:08,614 --> 00:34:10,313
Whoa, what?

858
00:34:10,315 --> 00:34:11,782
Ash's blood
was all over your bass.

859
00:34:11,784 --> 00:34:13,116
I don't know anything
about that.

860
00:34:13,118 --> 00:34:14,918
I-I ran because of these.

861
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:20,290
What, you're making fake IDs?

862
00:34:20,292 --> 00:34:22,559
That's how I make rent, okay?

863
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:23,794
How come you didn't tell us
Ash wanted

864
00:34:23,796 --> 00:34:25,395
to kick you out of the band?

865
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:26,663
(chuckles softly)

866
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:27,731
You didn't know that?

867
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:30,967
S-Sure, we... bumped heads.

868
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:35,705
He... he was gonna kick me out?

869
00:34:35,707 --> 00:34:38,241
Look, even if I'd known,
I wouldn't have hurt him.

870
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:39,376
You have proof?

871
00:34:39,378 --> 00:34:40,444
Um... yeah, yeah.

872
00:34:40,446 --> 00:34:42,179
This kid, Hunter,
from Silver Lake.

873
00:34:42,181 --> 00:34:44,247
He's like 16, maybe less?

874
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:47,317
I, uh, made him an ID
that said he's 27.

875
00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:49,653
Anyway, he hung
around me all night.

876
00:34:49,655 --> 00:34:50,754
Actually, check Wobble.

877
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:52,189
He was live posting stuff
of us all night.

878
00:34:52,191 --> 00:34:55,826
His ID is
HunterSTomstoned.

879
00:34:57,529 --> 00:34:58,829
I'm legal!

880
00:34:58,831 --> 00:35:00,530
(whoops)

881
00:35:00,532 --> 00:35:02,432
There's a bunch more.

882
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:04,935
Looks like they cover
the time of death.

883
00:35:04,937 --> 00:35:06,369
Like I said, I didn't do it.

884
00:35:06,371 --> 00:35:08,238
Then how did Ash's blood
get all over your bass?

885
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,874
CHLOE:
Hold on, look at this.

886
00:35:12,077 --> 00:35:14,544
That's Doug,
our drummer.

887
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:16,379
He loaded our gear.

888
00:35:16,381 --> 00:35:18,348
Doug had the bass last.

889
00:35:19,685 --> 00:35:21,017
(clears throat)

890
00:35:23,722 --> 00:35:26,490
You know what?
I should just stay here.

891
00:35:26,492 --> 00:35:30,093
Finish up Marla's arrest
report, but, um...

892
00:35:30,095 --> 00:35:33,697
maybe your consultant is free.

893
00:35:33,699 --> 00:35:35,932
(sighs)

894
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:37,834
(knocking on door)

895
00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:40,704
Doug Kennedy, LAPD.

896
00:35:40,706 --> 00:35:43,306
Ugh. Typical youth of today,
leaving the door unlocked.

897
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:44,341
Shh!

898
00:35:44,343 --> 00:35:45,976
(phone ringing)

899
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:49,246
Uh, sorry, I...

900
00:35:49,248 --> 00:35:51,181
It's Candy.
(sighs)

901
00:35:51,183 --> 00:35:52,315
Just...

902
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:56,620
(whispering): Candy, darling,
I can't talk now.

903
00:35:56,622 --> 00:35:58,321
About to catch a killer.

904
00:35:58,323 --> 00:35:59,656
(grunts)

905
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,124
(choking)

906
00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:03,527
Gonna have to call you back!

907
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:10,000
(choking)

908
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:11,434
Let him go, Doug.

909
00:36:11,436 --> 00:36:12,736
DOUG:
You stay back!

910
00:36:12,738 --> 00:36:14,471
J-Just stay back!

911
00:36:14,473 --> 00:36:16,139
This is all Ash's fault!

912
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:17,374
We were gonna make it big,

913
00:36:17,376 --> 00:36:19,709
and then Ash said
he was gonna going solo.

914
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:21,545
He was gonna bail on all of us.

915
00:36:21,547 --> 00:36:23,580
I went to smack him
and I freaking lost it!

916
00:36:23,582 --> 00:36:25,382
You're making
this worse, Doug.

917
00:36:25,384 --> 00:36:27,551
Let him go.

918
00:36:27,553 --> 00:36:29,319
No. If you care about your
partner, you drop your gun, now!

919
00:36:29,321 --> 00:36:32,155
Oh, Go... You may as well just
yank the sucker, then, Dougie,

920
00:36:32,157 --> 00:36:34,758
'cause I'm useless
to her, you see?

921
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,327
What? That's not true, Lucifer.

922
00:36:37,329 --> 00:36:39,863
Isn't it? I mean,
you said as much yourself.

923
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:42,299
W-Wait, what the
hell's going on?

924
00:36:42,301 --> 00:36:44,734
LUCIFER: The detective
doesn't need me anymore.

925
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:46,503
So come on.

926
00:36:46,505 --> 00:36:47,904
Do your worst.

927
00:36:47,906 --> 00:36:49,439
Don't listen to him, Doug.

928
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:51,741
No, go on! Go on, go on.
Yank like it's your last wank.

929
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:55,078
Or better still, you shoot,
Detective. Come on.

930
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,381
Two birds, one bullet,
what do you say? Huh?

931
00:36:58,383 --> 00:36:59,649
(Lucifer grunts)

932
00:37:03,689 --> 00:37:04,888
(coughing)

933
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,056
You okay?

934
00:37:06,058 --> 00:37:07,157
I think so.

935
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:08,925
DOUG: Yeah, that's
because you shot me!

936
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:12,128
Doug Kennedy,
you're under arrest.

937
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:14,664
There's not a
scratch, Detective.

938
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:16,333
Impressive marksmanship.

939
00:37:16,335 --> 00:37:19,236
Actually, I was aiming for you.

940
00:37:19,238 --> 00:37:21,538
(chuckles)

941
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,340
(siren wailing)

942
00:37:27,312 --> 00:37:28,245
(gasps)

943
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:30,513
Oh, my God! Is Lucifer okay?

944
00:37:30,515 --> 00:37:32,215
We were on the phone
when he got cut off, and...
Candy.

945
00:37:32,217 --> 00:37:34,985
He's in the other room,
giving a statement.

946
00:37:34,987 --> 00:37:36,219
Don't worry.
He's fine.

947
00:37:36,221 --> 00:37:37,520
Did you save him?

948
00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:40,223
Thank you! Oh!

949
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:43,126
Oh. All... All righty. That's...

950
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:45,795
His job is way too dangerous.

951
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:47,497
I begged him to quit, but no.

952
00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:49,299
My hubby's all about his work.

953
00:37:49,301 --> 00:37:50,934
He is?

954
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:53,637
Oh, my God, it's "Detective
this," and "Detective that."

955
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:55,505
Working with you
means so much to him.

956
00:37:55,507 --> 00:37:57,841
Well, he's got a strange
way of showing it.

957
00:37:57,843 --> 00:37:58,975
Well, duh.

958
00:37:58,977 --> 00:38:00,644
Dude's totally messed up.

959
00:38:00,646 --> 00:38:03,113
But then, you probably
already know that, huh?

960
00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:05,582
'Cause you're kind of
the reason why?

961
00:38:05,584 --> 00:38:06,383
What? Uh...

962
00:38:06,385 --> 00:38:07,484
Didn't you two
just go

963
00:38:07,486 --> 00:38:09,753
through a super bananas
situation?

964
00:38:09,755 --> 00:38:11,488
With like, poison?

965
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,290
He kept saying
how he almost lost you,

966
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:15,292
and it was hell and stuff.

967
00:38:15,294 --> 00:38:17,160
Yeah, i-it was bananas.

968
00:38:17,162 --> 00:38:20,997
It, it, I... went
through a lot, and, um...

969
00:38:20,999 --> 00:38:23,400
And I... I guess he did, too.

970
00:38:23,402 --> 00:38:25,135
LUCIFER:
Great. Statement given...

971
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:27,437
Candy. Oh!
(grunts)

972
00:38:27,439 --> 00:38:28,638
Ow.

973
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,407
Uh, Candy darling,

974
00:38:30,409 --> 00:38:33,476
the detective's not
a big fan of PDA.

975
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:35,045
It's fine.

976
00:38:35,047 --> 00:38:37,213
I'm just glad
she's here for you.

977
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:40,483
See you tomorrow
at the precinct.

978
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:43,186
Detective.

979
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:47,757
Don't be late.

980
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:49,225
(Lucifer chuckles)

981
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:00,020
(footsteps approaching)

982
00:39:00,021 --> 00:39:01,471
Amenadiel seems to think
I owe you a chat.

983
00:39:01,473 --> 00:39:05,642
So I'll start by saying
I do not forgive you.

984
00:39:05,644 --> 00:39:08,378
I deserve that.

985
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,964
Hmm.

986
00:39:10,965 --> 00:39:13,549
However, you did make
quite a sacrifice for me.

987
00:39:13,552 --> 00:39:17,020
Despite your callous
manipulations,

988
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:20,023
maybe you were well-intentioned
somewhere,

989
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:22,592
deep, deep down.

990
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:24,794
Perhaps that counts
for something.

991
00:39:24,796 --> 00:39:27,931
I'm glad you think so, son.

992
00:39:27,933 --> 00:39:29,199
Besides,

993
00:39:29,201 --> 00:39:31,768
I'm far more pissed off at Dad.

994
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:34,537
I mean, you just tried to speed
up feelings I already had,

995
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:36,906
whereas he...

996
00:39:36,908 --> 00:39:38,441
Well.

997
00:39:38,443 --> 00:39:41,211
He made all those feelings
a lie.

998
00:39:42,647 --> 00:39:44,314
Anyway.

999
00:39:44,316 --> 00:39:47,250
Nice catching up.
I'll see you in a few millennia.

1000
00:39:48,086 --> 00:39:51,721
Lucifer, wait.

1001
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:54,424
I appreciate your honesty.

1002
00:39:54,426 --> 00:39:59,396
And now, I'd like
to be honest with you.

1003
00:39:59,398 --> 00:40:01,464
Oh. This'll be a hoot.

1004
00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:03,900
Since I escaped Hell,
all I've wanted is to get back

1005
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:06,870
to the Silver City,
to reunite our family.

1006
00:40:06,872 --> 00:40:09,339
You're still fantasizing
about heavenly rebellion?

1007
00:40:09,341 --> 00:40:11,441
Just let it go, Mum.

1008
00:40:11,443 --> 00:40:14,110
Been there, done that, big fall.

1009
00:40:14,112 --> 00:40:15,445
But that's just it.

1010
00:40:15,447 --> 00:40:17,747
Why do you think
you lost that fight?

1011
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:19,783
Oh, I don't know,
let's have a think, shall we?

1012
00:40:19,785 --> 00:40:21,702
Not enough cardio?

1013
00:40:21,703 --> 00:40:23,620
The fact that dear old
Dad's slightly almighty?

1014
00:40:23,622 --> 00:40:26,156
Because I was young,
woefully foolish and...

1015
00:40:26,158 --> 00:40:28,391
Unarmed?

1016
00:40:28,393 --> 00:40:30,226
You know that if you had
possessed the Flaming Sword,

1017
00:40:30,228 --> 00:40:32,529
the weapon that guarded Eden,

1018
00:40:32,531 --> 00:40:34,130
the weapon
that can cut through anything,

1019
00:40:34,132 --> 00:40:36,266
even the Gates of Heaven itself,

1020
00:40:36,268 --> 00:40:38,668
well, you would've won
that rebellion.

1021
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,203
Why are you dwelling
in the past?

1022
00:40:40,205 --> 00:40:41,771
The fact is,
I didn't have the sword,

1023
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:44,774
and Dad destroyed it
soon after, so...

1024
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:47,510
What if I told you that
the sword was right here,

1025
00:40:47,512 --> 00:40:48,878
on Earth?

1026
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,147
And it's already
in your possession.

1027
00:40:51,149 --> 00:40:52,549
What?

1028
00:40:52,551 --> 00:40:55,351
The Flaming Sword
is Azrael's blade.

1029
00:40:55,353 --> 00:40:58,755
We have everything we need
to go home.

1030
00:41:09,668 --> 00:41:14,037
Well, the Oscar
goes to Candy Morningstar.

1031
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:15,438
You think they bought it?

1032
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,173
Yes, my mother doesn't know
what hit her.

1033
00:41:17,175 --> 00:41:18,575
So, thank you.

1034
00:41:18,577 --> 00:41:21,578
For helping me peek inside
that scheming head of hers.

1035
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:24,280
Well, it's the least I could do.

1036
00:41:24,282 --> 00:41:26,149
After what you did
for me in Vegas?

1037
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:28,117
You saved my life.

1038
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:30,587
Pretty sure I'm gonna owe you
for the rest of it.

1039
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:32,188
Let's call it even, shall we?

1040
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,456
Yeah.

1041
00:41:33,458 --> 00:41:35,058
Oh, that reminds me

1042
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,326
Oh, no, no, no.

1043
00:41:36,328 --> 00:41:37,293
You keep that.

1044
00:41:37,295 --> 00:41:38,561
I hear divorce

1045
00:41:38,563 --> 00:41:40,129
is quite expensive
these days.

1046
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:41,464
In fact,

1047
00:41:41,466 --> 00:41:44,067
why don't you add
this one to the, uh, pot?

1048
00:41:44,069 --> 00:41:46,035
Thank you.

1049
00:41:46,037 --> 00:41:47,537
I'll put them both to good use.

1050
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:51,341
(ditzy voice):
'Cause, you know,
I totally have so many plans.

1051
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:52,675
(both laugh)
Oh, God.

1052
00:41:54,212 --> 00:41:56,112
Well, to making plans.

1053
00:41:56,114 --> 00:41:57,814
Yeah.

1054
00:41:59,818 --> 00:42:01,818
All right.

1055
00:42:07,058 --> 00:42:08,625
Lucifer.

1056
00:42:09,794 --> 00:42:11,794
I get why you had me
con your family.

1057
00:42:11,796 --> 00:42:15,598
But what is going on
with you and Detective Decker?

1058
