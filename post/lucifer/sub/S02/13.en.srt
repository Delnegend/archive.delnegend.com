00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:04,303
<i> Previously on</i> Lucifer...
Uriel didn't just die.

2
00:00:04,305 --> 00:00:06,805
<i> I killed him.</i>

3
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:07,873
Where's Uriel?

4
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:09,308
Oh.

5
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,844
You look really familiar.
Have we met?

6
00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:13,779
35 years ago, Father asked
me to come down here

7
00:00:13,781 --> 00:00:16,315
<i> to bless a couple who</i>
<i> was unable to have a child.</i>

8
00:00:16,317 --> 00:00:18,017
MOM:
<i> God put her in Lucifer's path.</i>

9
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:19,318
Why are you so upset?

10
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,887
Because I just don't
know if it's real.

11
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:23,856
<i> Why is it that sometimes</i>
<i> I'm immortal,</i>

12
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:26,492
<i> and other times</i>
<i> I'm all too human?</i>

13
00:00:26,494 --> 00:00:28,227
<i>Appears you make me vulnerable.</i>

14
00:00:28,229 --> 00:00:30,562
What's in that package is
far more valuable than drugs.

15
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:32,031
LUCIFER:
<i> You're a bad man.</i>

16
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:34,199
DAN:<i> Dr. Jason Carlisle.</i>
<i> He saved the dissertation</i>

17
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,668
<i> while an innocent</i>

18
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,138
(shouts)

19
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,040
Freeze!

20
00:00:41,042 --> 00:00:42,408
ELLA:
<i>We are talking designer poison,</i>
<i> here.</i>

21
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,309
So, how do we get an antidote?

22
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:45,878
Well, that right there
is the tricky part.

23
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,213
<i> Designer poisons need</i>
<i> designer antidotes.</i>

24
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:49,214
LUCIFER:
Detective!

25
00:00:50,818 --> 00:00:54,453
It won't stop.

26
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:03,595
(tires screech)

27
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:05,931
CHLOE:
<i> Lucifer.</i>

28
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:08,734
The bleeding stopped. You don't
have to drive like a maniac.

29
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:10,436
You've forgotten you've
been poisoned, Detective,

30
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:11,770
or has it already
reached your brain?

31
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:14,173
Maybe it's just a nosebleed.
I mean, I-I...

32
00:01:14,175 --> 00:01:15,774
How could the professor
have injected me?

33
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,843
I didn't get one
of his flu shots.

34
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:19,044
What about when
you went after him?

35
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:20,579
Well, I don't know.

36
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:24,283
I tackled him to the ground,
we-we struggled for a bit,

37
00:01:24,285 --> 00:01:26,785
and, God, I guess
if he injected me somehow,

38
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:28,754
it would have to be just...

39
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:32,291
Ugh.
Oh, God.

40
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:34,126
Everything's gonna be fine
once we get to the hospital.

41
00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:36,128
Okay?

42
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:39,198
We can't go to the hospital.

43
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,199
What?

44
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:41,433
Lucifer, going to the hospital

45
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:44,103
didn't help any
of the other victims.

46
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:46,638
The only thing that's
gonna save my life

47
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,040
is finding the antidote.

48
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,910
Otherwise, I'm...

49
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:54,980
All right. All right, very well.

50
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:56,982
(tires screech)

51
00:02:03,057 --> 00:02:05,257
No judgments, guys, okay?

52
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:08,560
You said come right away,
so I came right away.

53
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:10,229
You're lucky I remembered
to put on pants...

54
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:12,164
eventually.
So, what's up?

55
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:13,999
Well, um...
Well,
we're worried

56
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:16,835
that someone else, um,
out there might be poisoned.

57
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:18,170
Oh, I doubt it.

58
00:02:18,172 --> 00:02:20,506
I asked every hospital
in the area to report anything

59
00:02:20,508 --> 00:02:22,741
even resembling a poisoning.

60
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:24,009
So far, haven't heard a peep.

61
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:26,912
Well, just to be sure,
let's, uh, let's go over

62
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:28,680
what you found at
the professor's lab, okay?

63
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:30,149
Check it out.

64
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:31,150
(whispering):
Uh, Detective.

65
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:33,018
We should tell her.

66
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,586
(whispering):
No, we can't.

67
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:36,688
She'll freak out. It'll get
in the way of the investigation.

68
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,090
I really don't think
this is a good idea.

69
00:02:38,092 --> 00:02:39,858
ELLA: Are you guys done
having your whisper fight?

70
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,962
Uh, just make out already
and get it over with. Yeesh.

71
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:46,165
So... I did find

72
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:47,866
this syringe on the scene.

73
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:51,537
It had a tiny bit of poison
left in it, so, yeah, in theory,

74
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:53,005
someone out there
may have been dosed.

75
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:55,474
Hmm.
Okay, but the
other poisons

76
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:56,942
had corresponding
antidotes, yeah?

77
00:02:56,944 --> 00:02:59,211
Mm-hmm.
Did you find anything
to match this one?

78
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:00,546
I did.

79
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:05,684
Problem is, dude destroyed
whatever was inside.

80
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,053
Dick move, right?

81
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:09,855
I mean, that's why I'm glad no
one's reported to any hospitals,

82
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:11,223
'cause without the antidote,

83
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:13,692
ugh, they'd end up
just like the other victims.

84
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:16,662
You know, first
a bloody nose and then

85
00:03:16,664 --> 00:03:19,398
fainting spells,
followed by seizures...
We get the point.

86
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,067
...and then their guts
slowly start boiling,

87
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:23,569
like, literally boiling.

88
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:25,804
It's so gross and nasty,
and 24 hours later...
(exhales)

89
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:28,407
...bam, just like that,
dead as a doornail.
Got it.
Thank you. Yes.

90
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:30,075
You've painting quite
the picture, Miss Lopez.
CHLOE: Right.

91
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:32,311
Yeah, let's go
over everything else

92
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:34,813
from the professor's lab. Okay?
LUCIFER: Mm.

93
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:35,981
Just to see if we've
missed anything.

94
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:37,416
Okay?
Sure.

95
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:41,687
Okay. So...

96
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:42,654
Here we go.

97
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,427
I got your text.
What's so urgent?

98
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:50,662
Uh... this way.

99
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:51,930
Somewhere we can
speak in private.

100
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:02,541
(grunts)

101
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:04,376
Was this part
of Father's plan?

102
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:05,577
Hmm?

103
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:06,578
Answer me, brother,

104
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,746
before I rip your spine out

105
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:08,747
and beat you to death with it.

106
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,015
What are you talking about?

107
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:12,684
How long...

108
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:14,620
how long have you
been manipulating me?

109
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:16,188
Mom told you about Chloe?

110
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,623
Oh, that she did.

111
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:20,559
And that you put
the detective in my path.

112
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:22,361
No, I didn't.

113
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:24,263
Father did.

114
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,933
I was just another pawn
in His game.

115
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,301
I had no idea.

116
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:30,969
And the detective?

117
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:35,707
Is she simply another pawn
as well or is she...

118
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:36,775
Is she?

119
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,877
She doesn't know anything.

120
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:50,122
Listen.

121
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:52,958
Luci, we've been
played like puppets.

122
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,894
Father has manipulated us both.

123
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:58,797
Don't you dare
compare our situations.

124
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:04,169
All that I have ever wanted
to do for all of my existence

125
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:05,504
was make Father proud.

126
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,076
I thought I was doing
great works in His name.

127
00:05:11,078 --> 00:05:12,844
Instead, the very first
of His angels

128
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:15,447
was busy making you
a little girlfriend.

129
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:18,850
Oh. Well, my heart
bleeds for you.

130
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,252
We're on the same side here,
brother.

131
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:21,219
Are we?

132
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,991
Then be honest with me, brother.

133
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:28,260
How deep does
Father's plan go?

134
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:31,196
Is the detective's poisoning
part of it?

135
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:34,299
Poisoning?

136
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:35,734
I don't know
what you're talking about.

137
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:38,003
You really don't know?

138
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:39,538
No.

139
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,540
Then you...

140
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,577
...you can't help her.

141
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:49,715

142
00:05:49,717 --> 00:05:51,550
I'm sorry.

144
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:57,289
There you are. I've been looking
all over for you.

145
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,024
Amenadiel.

146
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,459
Give us a minute.

147
00:06:00,461 --> 00:06:03,195
I... have an idea.
I need to talk to you.

148
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:09,234
Okay, so the professor's
been using this Burt guy

149
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:11,036
(whispering):
to smuggle in the poisons.

150
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,204
What, so you think that Burt

151
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:13,405
might have smuggled
the antidotes as well?

152
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:15,340
Yes.
All right.

153
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:16,575
Point me to his prison cell.

154
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:18,877
Perhaps some toilet wine
waterboarding or...

155
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,212
(whispering):
Well, he's already out on bail,

156
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:22,147
but the good news is,
he does have an ankle bracelet

157
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:24,149
so he can't get far.

00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:15,787
We need to know the amounts

359
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:16,955
of each ingredient he used.

360
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:18,523
If we get it wrong,
it could be lethal.

361
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:21,159
The professor kept the
formula all to himself.

362
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:22,894
He liked to
brag about

363
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:25,129
how the only place it
existed was in his head.

364
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:26,364
You'd... you'd have to ask him.

365
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,732
Yeah, well, we can't do that.

366
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:29,033
He's dead.

367
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,902
Oh.

368
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:33,504
Um...

369
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:35,039
you still want
the painting though, right?

370
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,375
Uh...

371
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:49,420
Amenadiel told me
about your detective.

372
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:51,756
I'm sorry, son.

373
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:54,492
(scoffs)

374
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:57,395
I can't even
go in there.

375
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:01,165
I'd have to tell her how
monumentally screwed she is.

376
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:03,701
(laughs)
Or... or lie.

377
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:06,104
And we both know
I can't do that.

378
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:08,940
Well, if it's
any consolation,

379
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:10,275
you of all people
should know

380
00:15:10,277 --> 00:15:13,044
that the man that did this
is right where he belongs:

381
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:14,679
suffering in Hell.

382
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,783
You're right.
That... that's it.

383
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:21,552
Well, I'm glad I was
able to comfort you.

384
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:22,687
No, no, Mum,
you figured it out.

385
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:24,222
How I'm gonna
save the detective.

386
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:26,524
Um, I'm not sure
I understand.

387
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:28,960
I'm gonna pop down to Hell and
have a chat with the professor.

388
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:30,628
What? How?

389
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,030
Well, it's simple.
(chuckles)

390
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:34,966
All I need to do is die.
(Mom gasps)

391
00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:41,439
The plan is simple:

392
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,374
you kill me, I
go down to Hell,

393
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:44,575
interrogate
the professor,

394
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:46,477
get the formula
and then you bring me back.

395
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:49,547
Well, come on! Who's in?

396
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:52,317
This is a terrible idea.
I absolutely forbid it.

397
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,619
MAZE: I hate to agree
with Her Highness,

398
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:55,787
but she's right.

399
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,155
You'd be on your own.

400
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:58,389
We both know

401
00:15:58,391 --> 00:15:59,657
I can't go down with you.

402
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:01,326
Well, I went down and
came back once before,

403
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:02,560
it wasn't a problem.

404
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:04,295
That's because Father
brought you back.

405
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,798
MAZE: And you didn't
go through any of the doors.

406
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,567
Once you do,
you could be trapped... forever.

407
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:11,069
Well, that won't
happen, will it?

408
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:12,971
I'm the Lord of Hell,
for crying out loud.

409
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:14,305
You<i> were</i> the Lord of Hell.

410
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,240
You've been away

411
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:17,508
quite a long time.

412
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,444
You can't be certain
that this will work.

413
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:20,345
(scoffs)

414
00:16:20,347 --> 00:16:22,113
(chuckles, sighs)

415
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:23,581
What do you think?

416
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:28,586
I think...

417
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:32,657
that I followed
about half of that.

418
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:37,996
Do you guys do this a lot?

419
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:41,366
Like, celestial
planning sessions?

420
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:43,334
AMENADIEL: Oh,
apparently not. Otherwise,

421
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,003
we would have had a meeting
about carelessly revealing

422
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,371
our true nature
to a human.

423
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:47,805
Oh...
Which...

424
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:50,675
she has apparently known about
for a while and kept from me.

425
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,110
Yeah, well,
turnabout's fair play.

426
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:53,111
Hmm.

427
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:54,712
LINDA: Okay,
wrapping my brain

428
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:55,947
around this...

429
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:57,448
Lucifer, what makes you so sure

430
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,616
you'd go to Hell?

431
00:16:58,618 --> 00:16:59,784
In case you've
missed it, doctor,

432
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:00,952
I've been banned from Heaven.

433
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:02,353
There's no where else
for me to go.

434
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,722
And you're sure there's
no other way to get there?

435
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:06,157
I mean--
(scoffs)

436
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:07,492
I mean, dying?

437
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:09,394
Well, if anyone
has a better suggestion,

438
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:11,462
by all means,
speak up now.

439
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:12,697
Quite frankly,
I'd prefer to Uber there.

440
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,465
But...

441
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:17,502
look, I am doing this
with or without you.

442
00:17:17,504 --> 00:17:19,337
Well, I'm sorry.

443
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:22,840
Having spent millennia
in that terrible place,

444
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:25,176
I can't be part
of you going back.

445
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:26,878
Not even
for a moment.

446
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,646
Fine.

447
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:31,416
(sighs)
Amenadiel?

448
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:33,918
Are you coming?

449
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:37,755
No, Mom, I'm gonna help.

450
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:41,259
Chloe, she doesn't deserve this.

451
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:42,894
MAZE: This is
the craziest plan

452
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,095
I've ever heard.

453
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:46,264
I'm in.

454
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:49,767
Doctor, surely you
have some sensible advice.

455
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:51,002
Um, he's the Devil.

456
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:53,671
Nothing's really been sensible

457
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:55,873
since I found that out.

458
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,609
I will not help you
get trapped down there.

459
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:01,779
Not for some insignificant
human's life.

460
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:04,215
(footfalls receding)

461
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:05,850
LUCIFER:
Okay.

462
00:18:05,852 --> 00:18:08,719
Now that party pooper's gone,
let's get started, shall we?

463
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:10,054
So, um,

464
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:13,624
what's my part in all of this?

465
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:15,860
Well, you went to medical
school, correct?

466
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:18,930
Many... many, many, many
years ago.

467
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:21,199
Good. So you'll be the one
bringing me back from the dead.

468
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:24,635
Okay, who wants
to kill me?

469
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:27,538
(scoffs)

470
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:32,910
LUCIFER: Ah, Daniel,
there you are. Have you gathered

471
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:34,812
the ingredients
for the antidote yet?

472
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:37,415
What? No, I've just been
spending time with Chloe.

473
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:40,451
Besides, those ingredients are
useless without the formula.

474
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:41,619
Well,
you might want to hop on it,

475
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,054
because I'm about
to get the formula.

476
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:44,288
What? How?

477
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,957
Fairly certain
you don't want to know.

478
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,759
Well, you--
you do what you have to.

479
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:50,161
Ella and I
will get those ingredients.

480
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:51,963
Right.

481
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:04,142
LINDA:
<i> This is crazy.</i>

482
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:05,176
I can't do this.

483
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:06,277
Yeah,
and neither can I.

484
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,412
These scrubs
are so boxy.

485
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:10,681
Even I can't
pull 'em off.

486
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,317
Scratch that.

487
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,620
I can pull off
anything.

488
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:17,121
Yes, you're right.
We can do this.

489
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:18,256
We can do this, right?

490
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:19,490
We have to.

491
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,659
Chloe's life depends on it.
This is it.

492
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:24,028
This is the room
directly below Chloe's.

493
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:26,631
LUCIFER:
<i> Make sure no one</i>

494
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:27,665
moves the detective.

495
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,100
I'll be in the
room below,

496
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:30,668
but she needs to remain
in there for this to work.

497
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,503
Because being close to her
makes you vulnerable.

498
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:35,273
Well, killable, in
this case, but yes.

499
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:36,908
So I keep her here
until you're dead?

500
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:39,677
No, no, no.
The entire time.

501
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,045
Even after you've
already been killed?

502
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:42,647
Well, who knows what happens
if I become invulnerable

503
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:43,814
when I'm already dead.

504
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:45,383
There's a good chance

505
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:46,784
the doctor won't be able
to revive me.

506
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:48,619
And we don't want me
to stay dead, do we?

507
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:50,821
That was a rhetorical question.

508
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:52,323
Right.
Right.

509
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:53,891
And you trust
me with this?

510
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:54,959
Brother,

511
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:56,494
you're the most
stubborn,

512
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:57,828
bullheaded person I know.

513
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,031
If anyone can prevent
the detective

514
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,399
from being moved, it's you.

515
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:03,701
Luci?

516
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:06,137
What? What?

517
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:07,672
Good luck.

518
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:10,007
Don't worry,
brother.

519
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:11,909
It feels like a good day to die.

520
00:20:14,514 --> 00:20:19,417
♪ ♪

521
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:20,851
DAN:
Ella?

522
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:22,687
We got a package
from CDC.

523
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:24,355
How many more ingredients
do we need?

524
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:26,424
Well, based off the list
from that middleman dude,

525
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:27,892
we've gathered all but one:

526
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:29,527
a chemical called ZX3.

527
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:31,329
Super rare, super illegal.

528
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:32,263
How rare?

529
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:33,497
Let's put it this way:

530
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:35,032
all my legal contacts
are out of this stuff.

531
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:36,767
Wait, you have illegal contacts?

532
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:39,203
You don't? Whatever.

533
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:42,873
Some street racers secretly add
drops of ZX3 to their fuel

534
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:43,908
for a super shady
advantage.

535
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:44,909
How do you know that?

536
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:47,211
I used to steal cars.

537
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:49,180
It's not fun if you don't
drive 'em really, really fast.

538
00:20:49,182 --> 00:20:51,549
Anyway,

539
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:54,051
I know where some black
market ZX3 is locked up:

540
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:55,553
a chop shop in NoHo.

541
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:58,389
Problem is, I'm not sure I can
get the owner to hand it over.

542
00:20:58,391 --> 00:20:59,890
And we don't have time
for a warrant.

543
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:02,226
Well, desperate times...

544
00:21:02,228 --> 00:21:03,728
Call for a little B&E.

545
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:04,929
Mm-hmm.
Let's go.

546
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:08,065
(monitor beeping)
Right, so one zap

547
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:09,934
of this doohickey
will stop my heart?

548
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:12,903
Uh, the defibrillator
wasn't made for that, but yes.

549
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:15,239
Not what I thought I'd
be doing with my day.

550
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:17,041
I'm gonna give you
60 seconds,

551
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:18,809
then restart your heart
to bring you back.

552
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:21,212
60 seconds? I've had orgasms
that last longer.

553
00:21:21,214 --> 00:21:23,447
Time moves much slower
down there. Remember?

554
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:24,782
Yes, but we only get one shot
at this.

555
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,584
What if you yank me out
before I get the formula?

556
00:21:26,586 --> 00:21:28,986
60 seconds is already cutting
it closer than I'd like.

557
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:31,122
The brain only lasts
three minutes after death.

558
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:32,757
(sighs)
Or so I read.

559
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:35,226
Just now.
Like, on the ride over.

560
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:37,762
Why am I doing this again?

561
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:39,063
Because you care about

562
00:21:39,065 --> 00:21:40,765
saving the detective's life
almost as much as I do.

563
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:42,133
Now, come on!

564
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:43,567
I also care about your life,
Lucifer!

565
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:49,106
Okay, ice to slow your
brain cells from dying,

566
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:50,641
and painkillers to,
well, kill the pain.

567
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,443
Got it covered, thanks.

568
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:54,178
LINDA: Okay, Maze,
just like I showed you.

569
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,280
Yeah, got it.

570
00:21:56,282 --> 00:21:57,748
(exhales)

571
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,153
Okay.
You ready?

572
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,960
I can't! You do it.
No, no, no, no.

573
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:11,329
No, the deal was you kill him,
I bring him back.

574
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:13,431
But you're the doctor!
And you're the demon from Hell!

575
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:14,699
Goodness sake.

576
00:22:14,701 --> 00:22:17,968
(thump, then flatline)
Whoa!

577
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,004
Oh, my God.

578
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:21,005
He's dead.

579
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:24,508
He's really dead.

580
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:41,392
(echoing footsteps)

581
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,070
Who are you?

582
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:54,538
I'm Amenadiel.

583
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,573
I'm Lucifer's brother.

584
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,877
He, uh, asked me to watch over
your mom.

585
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:02,246
Like a guardian angel?

586
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:03,581
(chuckles)

587
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:05,750
I like your necklace.

588
00:23:05,752 --> 00:23:07,084
Thanks.

589
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:09,487
I, um, I like yours too.

590
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:14,658
A bad man did this
to my mommy.

591
00:23:16,763 --> 00:23:19,263
Why are there bad people
in the world?

592
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,933
I really don't know.

593
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:27,104
There might be bad people in
the world, but you know what?

594
00:23:27,106 --> 00:23:29,006
There's a lot more
good people in it.

595
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:30,207
Really?

596
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:31,909
Yeah.

597
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,778
Like all the good people
helping out your mom.

598
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:37,281
Like you?

599
00:23:37,283 --> 00:23:40,217
Well, I'm, uh...

600
00:23:40,219 --> 00:23:41,685
I'm trying to be good.

601
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:43,754
I think you're good.

Killer.
Coward!

No, you don't understand.
(crowd yelling louder)

620
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:01,265
I had no choice.

621
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:05,135
Leave me alone!

Remember me?

626
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:16,046
It keeps happening.
Over and over.

627
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:17,348
It's like I'm in Hell!

628
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,616
There's no "like"
about it.

629
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:21,652
What is this?

630
00:25:21,654 --> 00:25:25,189
This is a torture
of your own making.

631
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:26,390
Fueled by guilt.

632
00:25:26,392 --> 00:25:28,125
With a little bit of flair
thrown in for fun.

633
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:29,793
Please.

634
00:25:29,795 --> 00:25:31,195
I need to get out of here.

635
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:32,329
How do I get out?

636
00:25:32,331 --> 00:25:33,731
Well, it's quite simple,

637
00:25:33,733 --> 00:25:35,232
you can't.

638
00:25:35,234 --> 00:25:38,569
What?
Not until you no longer
believe you deserve it.

639
00:25:38,571 --> 00:25:40,905
And I have never seen anyone
pull themselves out of here.

640
00:25:40,907 --> 00:25:42,339
Oh, God, no, no, no.

641
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:44,542
No, no...
However,

642
00:25:44,544 --> 00:25:46,677
perhaps making some
amends for your misdeeds

643
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:48,012
might do the trick.

644
00:25:48,014 --> 00:25:49,480
Anything. Please.

645
00:25:49,482 --> 00:25:50,681
How do I make amends?

646
00:25:50,683 --> 00:25:54,184
Well, before you so rudely
ended your own life,

647
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:55,553
you poisoned a detective.

648
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:57,421
Someone who I care about
very much.

649
00:25:57,423 --> 00:26:00,491
There's still time
to save her.

650
00:26:00,493 --> 00:26:02,593
So, if you give me the formula
to her antidote,

651
00:26:02,595 --> 00:26:05,329
perhaps your guilt
might be alleviated.

652
00:26:05,331 --> 00:26:06,664
Yeah?

653
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:09,233
(panting)

654
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:11,101
Tick tock, Professor!

655
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:15,573
There.

656
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:16,740
The formula.

657
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:18,342
Does that make us good?

658
00:26:18,344 --> 00:26:21,412
(soft chuckle)

659
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:22,413
You tell me.

660
00:26:25,685 --> 00:26:28,385
(sighs)

661
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:29,353
I didn't think so.

662
00:26:31,891 --> 00:26:33,457
No.

663
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:35,025
No, please!

664
00:26:35,027 --> 00:26:36,060
No!

665
00:26:36,062 --> 00:26:38,028
<i> No! No!</i>

666
00:26:49,976 --> 00:26:52,209
Where's a resurrection
when you need one?

667
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,215
Could really use my flask
right about now.

00:27:32,618 --> 00:27:35,419
I never could play as
well as you, brother.

673
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:44,194
Uriel...

674
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:45,195
I...

675
00:27:45,197 --> 00:27:46,697
I know.

676
00:27:46,699 --> 00:27:48,332
It's a lot to take in,
isn't it?

677
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:51,035
I don't...

678
00:27:51,037 --> 00:27:53,504
(laughs)

679
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:56,807
I-I don't understand,
Azrael's blade,

680
00:27:56,809 --> 00:27:58,876
it should've destroyed you,
not sent you to Hell.

681
00:27:58,878 --> 00:28:00,678
You don't deserve
to be here, brother.

682
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,446
You're right, I don't.

683
00:28:02,448 --> 00:28:03,781
But you do.

684
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:09,520
(gasps)

685
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:10,921
You think it's
that easy to let go?

686
00:28:12,058 --> 00:28:13,090
Think again, brother.

687
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:15,592
(knife unsheaths)

688
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:20,731
(Lucifer yells, Uriel grunts)

689
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:23,901
No. No, no, no, no, no,
no, what's happening?

690
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:25,469
What's happening?

691
00:28:25,471 --> 00:28:27,805
I need to save
the detective.

692
00:28:27,807 --> 00:28:30,741
But you just can't
help yourself, can you?

693
00:28:30,743 --> 00:28:32,810
(Lucifer whimpers,
knife unsheaths)

694
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,346
You have to believe me,

695
00:28:36,348 --> 00:28:37,981
I didn't want this.

696
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:39,950
And yet...

697
00:28:42,655 --> 00:28:43,887
(yells)

698
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:45,055

699
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:47,391
60 seconds!
Clear!

(thump, flatline continues)

701
00:28:52,665 --> 00:28:54,264
I thought you said
this would work, Linda!

702
00:28:54,266 --> 00:28:55,966
Shh! Clear!

703
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:01,538
No, no, no!

704
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,973
What was I thinking?

705
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,477
This was always
a terrible idea.

706
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:13,283
You know, we are not
cat burglars.

707
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:14,952
We are totally
gonna get caught.

708
00:29:14,954 --> 00:29:16,220
"Cat burglars"?

709
00:29:16,222 --> 00:29:18,055
What are you,
an old-timey desperado?

710
00:29:18,057 --> 00:29:20,357
I'm just saying we're a
little out of our element.

711
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:22,025
Speak for yourself.

712
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:23,193
Yeah, I noticed.

713
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:25,028
Where'd you learn to
pick a lock like that?

714
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,096
My grandma.

715
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,397
Wow.

716
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:29,199
And what exactly
are we looking for again?

717
00:29:29,201 --> 00:29:30,868
MAN:
Hey!
(rifle cocks)

718
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,503
You picked the wrong
place to rob.

719
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:35,973
(yells)
I'm sorry.

720
00:29:35,975 --> 00:29:38,375
I'm sorry, I can't
make it stop.

721
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:39,376
"It?"

722
00:29:39,378 --> 00:29:41,879
As if you had
no part in it.

723
00:29:41,881 --> 00:29:43,781
I don't! I didn't.

724
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:44,882
I-I don't want this!

725
00:29:44,884 --> 00:29:45,949
Look at you.

726
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,818
So pitiful.

727
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,753
Stuck in the very Hell
you once ruled.

728
00:29:49,755 --> 00:29:51,955
Trapped by
your own guilt.

729
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:53,824
And while we're pointing out
how lame you are,

730
00:29:53,826 --> 00:29:56,393
you didn't even follow up on
that thing I told you.

731
00:29:57,897 --> 00:30:00,230
What I whispered in
your ear before I died.

732
00:30:00,232 --> 00:30:01,932
What?

733
00:30:01,934 --> 00:30:04,401
<i> "The peace is here"?</i>

734
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:06,603
The peace is here.

735
00:30:06,605 --> 00:30:09,406
I... I thought that
was just nonsense.

736
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:12,743
The... the final ramblings
of a dying brain. I...

737
00:30:12,745 --> 00:30:17,014
Unless you're saying you found
peace in that moment, brother.

738
00:30:17,016 --> 00:30:18,248
Oh, Luci, Luci, Luci.

739
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,616
You should know
better than that.

740
00:30:19,618 --> 00:30:21,752
I'm all about patterns,

741
00:30:21,754 --> 00:30:23,587
predicting the future.

742
00:30:23,589 --> 00:30:25,255
My last words were a clue.

743
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:26,757
A clue? A clue to what?

744
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:28,826
Well, you're the one who has
to figure that out, aren't you?

745
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:29,993
After all,

746
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:32,029
I'm just in your head.

747
00:30:32,031 --> 00:30:36,266
I'm just a manifestation of
your own guilty conscience.

748
00:30:36,268 --> 00:30:38,168
Speaking of...

Ouch.

00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,876
No.
(panting)

752
00:30:45,878 --> 00:30:47,010
I hope you didn't leave any

753
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:48,979
unfinished business
up on Earth...
What?

754
00:30:48,981 --> 00:30:50,514
...'cause you're never
getting out of here.

755
00:30:52,885 --> 00:30:54,885
(monitor alarm beeping rapidly)

756
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,456
What's happening?
(door opens)

757
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,124
Doctor just paged us.
She's in V-tach.

758
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:02,659
I don't know.

759
00:31:02,661 --> 00:31:04,995
Let's go wait
outside, okay?
Crash cart's on its way.

760
00:31:04,997 --> 00:31:07,998
It's okay, I'm gonna
stay with your mom.

761
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,199
Go with the nurse.

762
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,201

763
00:31:14,673 --> 00:31:16,406

Go ahead and turn her
on her side.

765
00:31:19,645 --> 00:31:20,644
NURSE 2:
She's seizing.

766
00:31:20,646 --> 00:31:22,012
MAZE:
<i> This isn't right.</i>

767
00:31:22,014 --> 00:31:24,047
Something's wrong in Hell.
(flatline)

768
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,048
What?

769
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,149
He's stuck.

770
00:31:26,151 --> 00:31:27,384
Trapped in one of
those cells.

771
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:28,819
That's why we can't
revive him.

772
00:31:28,821 --> 00:31:30,654
Okay, so then what do we
have to do to bust him out?

773
00:31:30,656 --> 00:31:32,923
Someone needs to go down there
and pull him out.

774
00:31:32,925 --> 00:31:35,092
I'd go, but I can't.

775
00:31:35,094 --> 00:31:36,760
Why not?

776
00:31:36,762 --> 00:31:38,562
Demons don't have a soul.

777
00:31:38,564 --> 00:31:39,997
If I die,

778
00:31:39,999 --> 00:31:41,498
I just... die.

779
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,567
Okay, that's definitely
a discussion topic

780
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:46,336
for another time, but right now,
every second counts.

781
00:31:46,338 --> 00:31:49,773
And I can't believe
I'm saying this, but...

782
00:31:49,775 --> 00:31:51,775
what if I go?
What?

783
00:31:51,777 --> 00:31:54,411
You? What makes you think
you'd go to Hell and not Heaven?

784
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:56,046
There are things
you don't know about me.

785
00:31:56,048 --> 00:31:58,415
No. No way.
But Maze...

786
00:31:58,417 --> 00:31:59,549
MOM:
Send me.

787
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:01,218
MAZE:
Well.

788
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,920
Look who decided
to show up.

789
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:04,254
I'll go down and get him.

790
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:05,856
You said
you'd never go back.

791
00:32:05,858 --> 00:32:07,958
Yes, I have a paralyzing fear
of the place.

792
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,227
But I would face a thousand
Hells to save my son.

793
00:32:10,229 --> 00:32:11,929
Ever since I escaped,

794
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:14,398
Hell's been constantly
trying to pull me back.

795
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,267
It's only my resistance
that allows me

796
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:18,769
to fight its pull.

797
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:20,103
So, I just...

798
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:23,573
won't resist.

799
00:32:23,575 --> 00:32:24,908
So, how do we do this?

800
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,643
It appears

801
00:32:26,645 --> 00:32:28,111
that we need to attach
these little wires

893
00:36:12,638 --> 00:36:16,306
I pushed you and
that human closer,

894
00:36:16,308 --> 00:36:18,608
knowing it
would crush you

895
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:21,044
when you learned the truth.

896
00:36:21,046 --> 00:36:23,613
And now
look at us.

897
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:25,282
Stuck in this prison

898
00:36:25,284 --> 00:36:28,018
while Chloe is dying.

899
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,487
Chloe.

900
00:36:30,489 --> 00:36:33,957
No. I killed Uriel because
I had to. To save you.

901
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:35,625
To save the detective.

902
00:36:35,627 --> 00:36:38,061
And I need to save her now.

903
00:36:38,063 --> 00:36:40,263
Mum. Mum?
We need to leave.

904
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:43,733
Mum?

905
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:46,136
Why would we leave?

906
00:36:46,138 --> 00:36:48,471
Uriel is right here.

907
00:36:48,473 --> 00:36:51,041
We can stay.

908
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:52,876
Be a happy family.

909
00:36:53,912 --> 00:36:56,646
I've missed you so much, Mother.

910
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:58,715
Mum?

911
00:36:58,717 --> 00:36:59,816
Mum.

912
00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:02,085
Mum!

913
00:37:02,087 --> 00:37:03,820
Come on. You pulled
me out of my guilt,

914
00:37:03,822 --> 00:37:06,089
there's no time to get
stuck in yours. Come on.

915
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:08,558
Come on!
Please, don't abandon me.

916
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,860
Not again. Please.
Mum. Mum.

917
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:11,928
MOM:
No...

918
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,597
No. Lucifer...

919
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:14,998
No, please.

920
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,333
Shh.
Uriel!

921
00:37:16,335 --> 00:37:17,834
My sweet boy!

922
00:37:17,836 --> 00:37:19,436

Look who's back.

958
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:13,616
You didn't die
after all.

959
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:14,851

00:39:20,292 --> 00:39:21,558

Well...

962
00:39:23,562 --> 00:39:25,295
much as I'd like to take
all the credit,

963
00:39:25,297 --> 00:39:27,263
this one was a... a team effort.

964
00:39:30,135 --> 00:39:33,103
You know, this whole
poisoning thing has just...

965
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,740
...really put a pause
on everything

966
00:39:36,742 --> 00:39:39,342
that's been going on
with you and I, so...

967
00:39:39,344 --> 00:39:42,879
should we just pick up
where we left off?

968
00:39:46,017 --> 00:39:48,685
I think, right now,
you just need to focus

969
00:39:48,687 --> 00:39:50,220
on feeling better, Detective.

970
00:39:51,656 --> 00:39:54,157
Would you have someone
bring Trixie in?

971
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,725
Yes. Yes, of course.

972
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:57,494
And we'll talk.

973
00:39:57,496 --> 00:39:59,329
We'll talk later, yeah?

974
00:40:07,873 --> 00:40:09,172

975
00:40:09,174 --> 00:40:11,074
(sighs)

976
00:40:15,781 --> 00:40:17,614
MOM:
How is the detective?

977
00:40:17,616 --> 00:40:19,916
She'll be fine.

978
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:21,284
And...

979
00:40:21,286 --> 00:40:23,353
what about the two of you?

980
00:40:23,355 --> 00:40:24,554
(laughs)

981
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:26,356
Well, it was never real, was it?

982
00:40:26,358 --> 00:40:28,458
Lucifer, I am so sorry.

983
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,460
Father brought her
into existence

984
00:40:30,462 --> 00:40:33,029
just to put her in my path.
Yes.

985
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:35,064
The whole thing's
been a sham, Mum.

986
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:36,533
Long con.

987
00:40:36,535 --> 00:40:38,368
And I fell for it.

988
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:40,036
You can't blame yourself.

989
00:40:40,038 --> 00:40:43,973
This is all His doing. And
He should be punished for it.

990
00:40:43,975 --> 00:40:46,042
Oh, make no mistake,
I plan on that.

991
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:48,144
I mean, how can I trust
anything, anyone,

992
00:40:48,146 --> 00:40:51,147
now that I know He might be
behind it all?

993
00:40:51,149 --> 00:40:52,715
Well, you can trust me.

994
00:40:52,717 --> 00:40:53,817
Can I, Mum?

995
00:40:53,819 --> 00:40:55,618
Yeah.
You're as bad as He is.

996
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,220
Worse, maybe.

997
00:40:57,222 --> 00:40:59,289
At least He doesn't
pretend to love me.

998
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:00,457
Lucifer.

999
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:02,926
I<i> do</i> love you.

1000
00:41:02,928 --> 00:41:04,227
(laughs)

1001
00:41:04,229 --> 00:41:06,062
I went back to Hell for you.

1002
00:41:06,064 --> 00:41:08,331
I helped save the
detective, for you.

1003
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:10,266
Doesn't that count for anything?

1004
00:41:10,268 --> 00:41:12,302
It's too little too late,
Mother.

1005
00:41:13,939 --> 00:41:17,841
You set out to break
my heart. Well...

1006
00:41:17,843 --> 00:41:19,008
mission accomplished.
