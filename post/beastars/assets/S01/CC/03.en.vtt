00:01:46.023 --> 00:01:50.944
A WOLF IS BORN

00:01:56.742 --> 00:01:59.745
This isn't your hair, is it?

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.081
Well, last night,

00:02:03.165 --> 00:02:06.668
I went on a date
with this really cute dwarf rabbit.

00:02:07.336 --> 00:02:09.671
What if your scary girlfriend finds out?

00:02:09.755 --> 00:02:11.423
She was fricking cute!

00:02:11.506 --> 00:02:13.050
I'm speechless.

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:16.928
She's funny, straight-forward,
and really sexy.

00:02:17.012 --> 00:02:20.932
Wait a minute.
Is she in the gardening club?

00:02:21.016 --> 00:02:23.685
I think so. You know her?

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.563
No patterns on her body,

00:02:27.314 --> 00:02:28.315
all white?

00:02:29.524 --> 00:02:32.611
A restless sleeper

00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:36.573
and tidies the room up after she's done?

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:40.494
So you've hooked up with her, too?

00:02:41.787 --> 00:02:43.372
I see.

00:02:45.582 --> 00:02:49.044
There must be more males
who fell prey to her.

00:02:49.127 --> 00:02:52.130
Prey? She's just a rabbit.

00:02:52.214 --> 00:02:53.215
Better watch out.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.970
In your case, she's going to gobble you up
and spit out your bones.

00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:04.101
Females like her may be
more ferocious inside than any carnivore.

00:03:05.352 --> 00:03:06.311
GARDENING CLUB

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:12.734
<i>Well, I'm sure nothing would happen</i>
<i>between a wolf and a rabbit.</i>

00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:15.737
<i>Especially Legoshi.</i>

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:20.033
Are you nervous? Just relax.

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:24.871
It's my first time, too, with a carnivore.

00:03:25.414 --> 00:03:27.124
<i>Is this a kind of greeting?</i>

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:31.503
Your belly hair's the same color
as your face.

00:03:31.586 --> 00:03:35.048
<i>This is how small animals greet</i>
<i>each other?</i>

00:03:35.757 --> 00:03:37.426
Such a beautiful cream color.

00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:40.721
I want to know...

00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:42.597
where it leads to.

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:46.476
What?

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.855
I need you to be cooperative
to create a romantic atmosphere.

00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:52.023
Isn't that what you came here for?

00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:54.776
-What do you mean?
-I'm saying...

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.948
<i>Oh, gosh.</i>

00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:02.743
<i>Did I jump to conclusions?</i>

00:04:02.826 --> 00:04:04.536
<i>But still, he refuses after</i>

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:06.371
<i>-I took off his belt?</i>
-You'll catch a cold.

00:04:08.206 --> 00:04:10.083
You may also get bug bites.

00:04:10.584 --> 00:04:12.169
You should get dressed.

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:13.462
I'm going back.

00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:14.838
Sorry to bother you!

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:21.636
He's gone.

00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:27.350
<i>So he really didn't come here for that.</i>

00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:29.978
<i>I feel guilty.</i>

00:04:30.604 --> 00:04:32.439
<i>Of course he'd run away.</i>

00:04:35.317 --> 00:04:36.735
<i>Wait, really?</i>

00:04:36.818 --> 00:04:39.821
<i>How come a big carnivore like him</i>
<i>would want to run away?</i>

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.950
<i>He was seduced</i>
<i>and all he did was to cover me up?</i>

00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:48.997
<i>That's ridiculous.</i>

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:52.459
<i>What a weirdo.</i>

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.390
<i>What was that?</i>

00:05:07.933 --> 00:05:10.560
<i>What just happened to me?</i>

00:05:10.644 --> 00:05:11.853
Legoshi.

00:05:15.106 --> 00:05:16.441
I'm sorry about that.

00:05:16.525 --> 00:05:18.360
I was waiting for you to return.

00:05:18.443 --> 00:05:20.320
Hey, why did you leave--

00:05:20.403 --> 00:05:22.864
Anyway, nothing happened to you?

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:26.743
Nothing in particular.

00:05:28.578 --> 00:05:30.831
-What should we do?
-Let me see.

00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:33.416
I see. I'm relieved.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.044
You were running down the stairs
four at a time,

00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:38.213
so I thought you were in a fix.

00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:41.007
What do you mean by... a fix?

00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:46.054
There's a buzz among the herbivores

00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:47.931
about that rabbit.

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:52.978
Apparently, she's sleeping around
with so many males.

00:05:53.603 --> 00:05:55.605
I mean, that's a slut.

00:05:56.606 --> 00:05:59.651
Can you believe it? She looks so innocent.

00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:03.697
I guess even she couldn't do anything
to a wolf, though.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.740
So, did you get roses?

00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:11.037
Flowers...

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.500
She said she tends flowers thoroughly

00:06:16.334 --> 00:06:18.545
as if they're her children.

00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:23.842
I'll talk to everyone and scratch the plan
of getting roses from the garden.

00:06:25.552 --> 00:06:27.971
You might be hearing
a lot of things about her,

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.140
but I think she's nice.

00:06:33.268 --> 00:06:34.477
What a weirdo.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.279
<i>So she's called a slut.</i>

00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:48.950
<i>But you can't describe her in one word.</i>

00:06:50.201 --> 00:06:53.788
<i>Well, I tried to eat her before,</i>
<i>so I shouldn't be the one saying that.</i>

00:06:55.874 --> 00:06:59.002
<i>I don't really know about girls.</i>

00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:03.006
<i>Come to think of it,</i>

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:05.592
<i>I've never had a girlfriend in my life.</i>

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:12.390
You have overcome species differences

00:07:12.474 --> 00:07:15.894
and achieved outstanding results
in various competitions.

00:07:16.728 --> 00:07:22.651
You have also contributed immensely
to the prosperity of Cherryton School.

00:07:22.734 --> 00:07:25.904
To praise your achievement,

00:07:25.987 --> 00:07:29.240
I hereby grant you
the Cherryton School Honor Award.

00:07:30.533 --> 00:07:34.371
I'm also looking forward to
the drama club's performances this year.

00:07:34.955 --> 00:07:37.248
We'll do our best.

00:07:45.382 --> 00:07:47.092
Coexistence and coprosperity.

00:07:47.676 --> 00:07:53.765
Our drama club will continue
to prove its importance on stage.

00:07:57.852 --> 00:07:59.604
<i>What an inspiring speech.</i>

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:01.773
<i>Amazing.</i>

00:08:03.692 --> 00:08:05.902
<i>To hell with coexistence and coprosperity.</i>

00:08:05.986 --> 00:08:07.320
Lower your voice.

00:08:07.404 --> 00:08:10.323
He got rid of me from the acting team.

00:08:10.407 --> 00:08:12.200
Music, please.

00:08:12.283 --> 00:08:14.995
I've gotten used to this, though.

00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:16.579
That's good to know.

00:08:17.122 --> 00:08:21.292
Have you ever wanted to become an actor?

00:08:21.376 --> 00:08:22.335
No.

00:08:22.961 --> 00:08:24.129
Not even once.

00:08:24.212 --> 00:08:25.922
I'll adjust the other side, too.

00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:29.801
So were you surprised
when the supervisor headhunted you?

00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:32.679
All our members are headhunted.

00:08:33.263 --> 00:08:36.975
Only those appropriate for
this long-established club are recruited.

00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:38.685
But what are the criteria?

00:08:39.477 --> 00:08:40.478
What?

00:08:41.271 --> 00:08:44.649
You really don't know anything
about this club, do you?

00:08:45.442 --> 00:08:46.776
For example,

00:08:47.402 --> 00:08:49.529
Sheila from the dance team.

00:08:50.113 --> 00:08:55.994
That cheetah was working as a dominatrix
at a carnivore club for money from age 14

00:08:56.077 --> 00:08:57.620
and got headhunted.

00:08:58.663 --> 00:09:03.460
<i>Mina, a giraffe, has trypophobia</i>
<i>and can't stare at her own body.</i>

00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:08.590
<i>Moro, a rhino, believes that her horn,</i>
<i>always in sight, is her guardian angel.</i>

00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:12.802
And I, a mongoose, was abandoned
by my parents the moment I was born

00:09:12.886 --> 00:09:15.889
and raised by a family of hyenas.

00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:19.476
I can just keep talking.

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:24.064
Members of this club
all have unique backgrounds.

00:09:24.147 --> 00:09:27.150
Only those who have
gone through hardships can join.

00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:32.072
Our hidden motto, apparently,
is to show our philosophy of life.

00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:37.452
So, Legoshi, what's your secret?

00:09:38.912 --> 00:09:40.371
A secret...

00:09:41.164 --> 00:09:42.082
Does that mean...

00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:47.587
<i>Rouis also has</i>
<i>a secret he can't tell anyone?</i>

00:09:48.838 --> 00:09:50.465
<i>An infallible,</i>

00:09:51.049 --> 00:09:52.383
<i>solitary deer.</i>

00:09:55.178 --> 00:09:57.972
Hey, you useless PR team!

00:09:58.056 --> 00:10:00.266
What is this article?

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:04.687
Why isn't the photo
a close-up of the star?

00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:06.898
And you call yourselves PR?

00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:10.527
Go sell these school newspapers
to the students for 50 yen each!

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:14.280
We won't pay you for the hours,
nor for the ink, if you don't try harder.

00:10:14.364 --> 00:10:17.325
But he was on stage, and...

00:10:17.408 --> 00:10:20.370
Stop making excuses
and go find some scoops.

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:21.788
You should know by now.

00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:24.916
<i>Girls love that small face and big eyes.</i>

00:10:24.999 --> 00:10:30.672
<i>Having his close-up on the paper</i>
<i>would double the sales!</i>

00:10:31.256 --> 00:10:33.299
It's all about money in the end.

00:10:33.383 --> 00:10:35.802
Exploit him to the fullest. Understand?

00:10:35.885 --> 00:10:39.055
The drama club's welcome event
starts tomorrow.

00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:43.768
Tomorrow! You must get a close-up
of Rouis on stage.

00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:45.645
Okay.

00:10:47.397 --> 00:10:51.818
The club president was as cute as always.

00:10:54.195 --> 00:10:55.071
What's wrong?

00:10:55.905 --> 00:10:59.284
The camera's not working.
It's probably the battery.

00:10:59.367 --> 00:11:01.619
Oh, no! What about tomorrow?

00:11:02.162 --> 00:11:05.582
I'll just go on the second day.

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:09.377
But the paper would
probably be finished by then.

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.588
It's better than nothing.

00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:16.342
I have a feeling I can get a good shot.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.847
Usually you're more relaxed
on the second day.

00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:25.810
If Rouis makes a mistake
or passes out on stage,

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:28.062
that'll be a great scoop.

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:31.566
<i>It'll be a scandal.</i>

00:11:36.988 --> 00:11:39.949
STUDENT ID - NAME: ROUIS
CLASSIFICATION: RED DEER

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:42.201
MEDICINE

00:11:42.285 --> 00:11:44.579
<i>I've been deceiving myself until now,</i>

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:49.876
<i>but the more I train,</i>
<i>the more I'm breaking down.</i>

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.923
<i>I'm finally being confronted</i>
<i>by the harsh reality.</i>

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:58.718
<i>My body's not made for fighting.</i>

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.012
<i>I've known that since I was born.</i>

00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:05.516
<i>In the end, I'm one of the preys.</i>

00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:09.729
Excuse me.

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:14.609
-I...
<i>-No matter how hard I try...</i>

00:12:14.692 --> 00:12:16.235
<i>I'll never be a predator.</i>

00:12:19.614 --> 00:12:21.532
I've told you to knock.

00:12:22.367 --> 00:12:25.203
I'm sorry. I did, but you didn't answer.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:26.996
So I got worried.

00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:28.790
What do you want?

00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:32.502
I wanted to do a final check
on tomorrow's lighting.

00:12:34.295 --> 00:12:35.463
That was you?

00:12:35.546 --> 00:12:40.301
During the rehearsal, I took more time
to lower the light for the last scene.

00:12:41.344 --> 00:12:42.387
I noticed.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:43.972
Which was better for you?

00:12:44.681 --> 00:12:47.100
Since it's the last scene,
I personally think

00:12:48.393 --> 00:12:51.145
we should emphasize the afterglow.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:53.398
Well, I don't know.

00:12:53.982 --> 00:12:57.151
I wanted to hear your advice on this.

00:12:58.277 --> 00:13:01.155
You fidget a lot when you talk.

00:13:01.239 --> 00:13:03.449
-Gosh.
-I'm sorry.

00:13:03.533 --> 00:13:05.702
I cut my claws often,

00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:08.329
but they grow sharp again the next day.

00:13:09.163 --> 00:13:12.917
Are you saying you can't do anything
about your aggressive nature?

00:13:14.168 --> 00:13:16.129
That you're bothered by

00:13:16.713 --> 00:13:19.298
your undeniable aggressive nature?

00:13:22.301 --> 00:13:24.804
I've always wanted to ask you this.

00:13:25.888 --> 00:13:29.142
Why don't you take responsibility
for your own strength?

00:13:29.684 --> 00:13:32.562
Show it to me,
rather than holding it back.

00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:36.107
Go ahead, show me your fangs.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.402
<i>What are you saying, Rouis?</i>

00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:42.989
It's against the law for a carnivore
to show his fangs to an herbivore--

00:13:43.072 --> 00:13:44.991
Don't just call me an herbivore!

00:13:46.576 --> 00:13:48.411
Don't be so sneaky.

00:13:49.037 --> 00:13:53.041
A large carnivore like you is
what I loathe the most.

00:13:54.208 --> 00:13:55.376
Stop acting cool

00:13:56.169 --> 00:13:58.504
and be real for once.

00:14:00.006 --> 00:14:01.841
Bite, Legoshi.

00:14:01.924 --> 00:14:03.092
Bite me!

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.435
I'm... sorry.

00:14:14.187 --> 00:14:15.063
I...

00:14:16.147 --> 00:14:17.565
need to be sneaky.

00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:19.776
There's...

00:14:21.319 --> 00:14:23.196
nothing good about

00:14:24.197 --> 00:14:25.406
wolves being strong.

00:14:27.116 --> 00:14:28.368
But...

00:14:29.243 --> 00:14:30.828
you're different.

00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:36.167
You being strong bears a great meaning.

00:14:38.169 --> 00:14:40.963
Everyone's coming to see that tomorrow.

00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:44.550
To see the righteous strength.

00:14:50.264 --> 00:14:52.225
Sorry, I talked too much.

00:14:53.309 --> 00:14:54.811
I'll come back later.

00:14:59.816 --> 00:15:02.360
I didn't want to hear that from you.

00:15:06.531 --> 00:15:07.824
<i>Rouis.</i>

00:15:08.991 --> 00:15:10.243
<i>I'm...</i>

00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:14.539
<i>To all students.</i>

00:15:14.622 --> 00:15:16.833
<i>Today is "Biology Day."</i>

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.502
<i>If you haven't done it yet...</i>

00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:21.212
BIOLOGY HOUR FOR COMFORTS
ONE HOUR EVERY TWO DAYS

00:15:21.295 --> 00:15:23.423
<i>...please go to the basement immediately.</i>

00:15:29.387 --> 00:15:31.514
-Hey, Legoshi. Starting now?
-Yeah.

00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:32.849
-Take care.
-Thanks.

00:15:35.059 --> 00:15:37.687
What? I can't see because of the mist.

00:15:39.355 --> 00:15:42.275
It feels so good to blend in.

00:15:42.859 --> 00:15:45.903
-Isn't it hot in here today?
-You think so?

00:15:54.078 --> 00:15:56.831
<i>Rouis smelled of pain relief patches.</i>

00:15:58.082 --> 00:16:00.001
<i>He was acting weird, too.</i>

00:16:01.627 --> 00:16:04.505
Do rabbits really live on the moon?

00:16:04.589 --> 00:16:06.507
How would they breathe there?

00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:16.684
<i>That was probably the first time</i>
<i>I've ever been treated as a male.</i>

00:16:18.019 --> 00:16:20.188
<i>Can it be?</i>

00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:23.274
<i>I gave a speech to Rouis, but...</i>

00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:27.778
<i>I may not be just a monster</i>
<i>hidden in the dark.</i>

00:16:28.529 --> 00:16:32.617
<i>I'm a mammal, a carnivore, a canine,</i>

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:34.243
<i>and...</i>

00:16:36.162 --> 00:16:37.705
<i>a male wolf.</i>

00:16:39.415 --> 00:16:40.500
<i>I can...</i>

00:16:57.141 --> 00:16:59.185
<i>What do I call this feeling?</i>

00:17:00.603 --> 00:17:02.813
<i>It's like I can vaguely see myself,</i>

00:17:03.898 --> 00:17:05.858
<i>like I'm finally under the light,</i>

00:17:06.776 --> 00:17:08.319
<i>and can finally move forward.</i>

00:17:14.825 --> 00:17:16.160
<i>I see.</i>

00:17:16.702 --> 00:17:18.371
<i>I'm happy.</i>

00:17:19.622 --> 00:17:21.874
<i>I should accept this feeling, then.</i>

00:17:23.292 --> 00:17:25.920
<i>I want to see her again.</i>

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:34.303
ADLER

00:17:39.934 --> 00:17:42.395
<i>Mistakes are unacceptable.</i>

00:17:43.604 --> 00:17:45.856
<i>Screwing up on stage means...</i>

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.441
<i>death.</i>

00:17:51.445 --> 00:17:55.616
<i>I'll go to the hospital</i>
<i>once the show's over tomorrow.</i>

00:17:56.284 --> 00:17:57.868
<i>I'm used to being under pressure.</i>

00:17:58.578 --> 00:18:00.663
<i>I just focus only on myself.</i>

00:18:01.914 --> 00:18:02.999
<i>One.</i>

00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:04.625
<i>Just one.</i>

00:18:05.501 --> 00:18:08.546
<i>The only one I can trust...</i>

00:18:10.798 --> 00:18:12.425
<i>is myself.</i>

00:18:14.635 --> 00:18:17.972
<i>There are freshmen beyond this curtain,</i>

00:18:18.055 --> 00:18:22.226
<i>excited to watch our show</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:25.896
Don't worry. Do as you rehearsed.

00:18:26.439 --> 00:18:28.566
The rehearsal was good.

00:18:28.649 --> 00:18:30.026
<i>No way.</i>

00:18:30.651 --> 00:18:32.320
<i>It was terrible.</i>

00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:38.367
Our bond stayed firm
even after that incident.

00:18:39.702 --> 00:18:42.079
<i>Who cares about bonds now?</i>

00:18:42.705 --> 00:18:43.956
<i>I'm all that matters.</i>

00:18:44.665 --> 00:18:46.500
This is a special club.

00:18:47.043 --> 00:18:50.254
What we show on stage
is how both carnivores and herbivores

00:18:50.338 --> 00:18:52.882
live to the full extent.

00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:53.841
Understand?

00:18:53.924 --> 00:18:55.176
<i>Devote...</i>

00:18:55.259 --> 00:18:56.427
<i>to me.</i>

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:57.345
Yes!

00:19:00.264 --> 00:19:01.557
<i>That's right.</i>

00:19:02.266 --> 00:19:03.851
<i>Nobody can interfere.</i>

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.520
<i>This is my battle.</i>

00:19:08.064 --> 00:19:10.566
<i>Rouis' words just now</i>

00:19:11.275 --> 00:19:14.028
<i>sounded like he was telling himself.</i>

00:19:15.363 --> 00:19:18.115
<i>Rouis' makeup is almost done.</i>
<i>How's the lighting?</i>

00:19:19.033 --> 00:19:21.285
Spotlight one is ready.

00:19:23.412 --> 00:19:25.456
Rouis, you're ready for the stage.

00:19:29.418 --> 00:19:32.546
<i>I'll show you something worthy.</i>

00:19:33.547 --> 00:19:34.882
<i>Watch this!</i>

00:19:37.551 --> 00:19:39.804
<i>Here comes the wounded Reaper.</i>

00:19:45.226 --> 00:19:48.521
<i>This is my philosophy of life.</i>

00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:53.859
<i>Rouis' performance was terrific.</i>

00:19:54.777 --> 00:19:56.320
<i>It was breathtaking</i>

00:19:56.404 --> 00:19:59.281
<i>to watch the hero Reaper tremble</i>

00:19:59.365 --> 00:20:01.409
<i>and gasp for breath.</i>

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:06.706
<i>He held the stage</i>
<i>throughout the whole show.</i>

00:20:10.292 --> 00:20:12.378
You followed me here?

00:20:12.461 --> 00:20:15.381
My goodness, Ellen.

00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:19.343
I shall be happy to be by your side.

00:20:20.302 --> 00:20:21.846
I'm the Reaper.

00:20:22.555 --> 00:20:25.891
I'll prove my love with death.

00:20:35.401 --> 00:20:36.444
Ellen.

00:20:37.069 --> 00:20:38.654
Have you bid adieu

00:20:39.405 --> 00:20:40.489
to this world?

00:20:48.247 --> 00:20:49.415
<i>It's over.</i>

00:20:51.625 --> 00:20:53.252
<i>The curtain is closing.</i>

00:20:53.836 --> 00:20:55.212
<i>I hear the applause.</i>

00:20:56.088 --> 00:20:57.548
<i>What a great finale.</i>

00:20:58.632 --> 00:21:00.050
<i>I made it.</i>

00:21:01.469 --> 00:21:04.513
<i>I can't feel my legs at all.</i>

00:21:05.931 --> 00:21:09.226
<i>How am I even... standing?</i>

00:21:11.562 --> 00:21:13.355
<i>I made it.</i>

00:21:13.981 --> 00:21:15.566
<i>Did you all see that?</i>

00:21:16.358 --> 00:21:17.651
<i>I made it!</i>

00:21:18.319 --> 00:21:19.403
<i>I made it this far!</i>

00:21:20.571 --> 00:21:23.240
-Rouis?
-Rouis!

00:21:25.701 --> 00:21:26.786
<i>What?</i>

00:21:27.369 --> 00:21:29.580
<i>What's all this fuss?</i>

00:21:30.247 --> 00:21:31.874
<i>It's an ovation.</i>

00:21:32.917 --> 00:21:35.294
<i>Let's do the curtain call.</i>

00:23:03.966 --> 00:23:05.968
