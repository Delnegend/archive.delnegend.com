WEBVTT

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:20.938
BELOW THE FUR COAT

00:00:21.605 --> 00:00:25.734
This is how the marine language uses

00:00:25.817 --> 00:00:28.820
sound and bubbles
rather than words to communicate.

00:00:29.613 --> 00:00:31.990
<i>I'm Legom, a hen.</i>

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.868
<i>Because we're seated alphabetically,</i>

00:00:34.952 --> 00:00:37.704
<i>I'm sitting next to a dull male wolf.</i>

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:42.334
<i>He always looks stumped</i>
<i>with drooping brows,</i>

00:00:42.417 --> 00:00:45.712
<i>so I call him a brow-knitter.</i>

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.387
<i>The brow-knitter and I are not that close,</i>

00:00:54.096 --> 00:00:57.766
<i>but I know one of his secrets.</i>

00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:03.689
Class dismissed.
Review today's lesson thoroughly.

00:01:09.945 --> 00:01:12.072
You really like egg sandwiches.

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:14.366
It tastes the best on Wednesday.

00:01:14.449 --> 00:01:16.618
No way. They're all the same.

00:01:16.702 --> 00:01:19.997
No, they're different.
I can't explain it, though.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.792
It's too good to be sold at school.

00:01:25.377 --> 00:01:28.547
<i>Right? Of course it is.</i>

00:01:29.214 --> 00:01:33.427
<i>The egg sandwich he snacks on</i>
<i>every Wednesday,</i>

00:01:34.136 --> 00:01:38.056
<i>those eggs are, in fact, laid by me.</i>

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.933
EGG SUPPLY ROSTER (LEGOM)

00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:45.939
<i>I sell my eggs to restaurants on campus</i>
<i>as a part-time job.</i>

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.987
<i>I take great pride in this job.</i>

00:01:52.613 --> 00:01:54.031
Hey, Legom.

00:01:55.532 --> 00:01:59.161
I'm having a movie night tonight.
Do you want to come?

00:01:59.244 --> 00:02:01.913
Thanks for the invite, but I'll pass.

00:02:02.497 --> 00:02:05.167
Staying up too late would be
bad for my eggs.

00:02:05.751 --> 00:02:09.630
What? It's just a part-time job,
take it easy.

00:02:09.713 --> 00:02:11.256
You're wrong.

00:02:12.883 --> 00:02:16.595
Laying eggs is not a mere part-time job.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.975
I'm doing this for our dignity
and pride of all henkind.

00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:24.603
Excuse me.

00:02:24.686 --> 00:02:28.398
I even started exercising, which is my
least favorite, for a mere part-time job.

00:02:29.274 --> 00:02:31.777
Don't worry. I'm not upset.

00:02:33.195 --> 00:02:34.404
Legom.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.827
<i>I'm not doing this to provide</i>
<i>carnivores with necessary protein.</i>

00:02:41.536 --> 00:02:44.289
<i>It's for nobody else but me.</i>

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.418
<i>I'll keep laying high-quality eggs.</i>

00:02:49.336 --> 00:02:53.632
<i>That, for sure, is my beautiful life.</i>

00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:05.977
JUNE 16, WEDNESDAY

00:03:06.061 --> 00:03:08.021
Hey, Legoshi.

00:03:08.105 --> 00:03:10.774
Today's Wednesday,
where's your egg sandwich?

00:03:12.317 --> 00:03:15.320
It tastes different these days.

00:03:16.613 --> 00:03:19.324
I told you, they're all the same.

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:21.952
Maybe...

00:03:29.668 --> 00:03:31.336
That's too bad.

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:34.131
It tastes so bad

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:36.133
that I lost one customer.

00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:38.760
<i>Awareness as a hen.</i>

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:42.597
<i>Everything I did for my eggs...</i>

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:44.725
<i>what was it all for?</i>

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.643
OPEN

00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:51.481
This is for this week.

00:03:51.565 --> 00:03:55.819
-And I wanted to ask--
-Oh, yes, I forgot to tell you

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:58.739
that your eggs have a good reputation,

00:03:58.822 --> 00:04:01.783
so I decided to sell them
on our busiest day, Friday.

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:06.204
You really are a great fit for this.
Everyone's enjoying your eggs.

00:04:06.747 --> 00:04:08.457
Keep up the good work.

00:04:14.296 --> 00:04:16.173
Everyone, get to your seats.

00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:18.175
Don't be lazy just because it's Friday.

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:26.641
Excuse me, do you have an eraser?

00:04:26.725 --> 00:04:30.228
Unfortunately, I only have one.

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:33.190
Okay.

00:04:34.065 --> 00:04:37.694
<i>The brow-knitter still hasn't realized</i>

00:04:37.778 --> 00:04:41.031
<i>that my eggs are now sold on Friday.</i>

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:43.533
<i>My eggs...</i>

00:04:44.493 --> 00:04:47.954
<i>are so much tastier now.</i>

00:06:26.761 --> 00:06:28.471
<i>I'm here again.</i>

00:06:29.556 --> 00:06:31.308
<i>I always get lost.</i>

00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:33.810
<i>The solemn, quiet,</i>

00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:36.146
<i>beautiful and cold forest.</i>

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:41.318
<i>I've walked around here so much</i>
<i>so I already know</i>

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:45.488
<i>there's nowhere warm here.</i>

00:06:47.616 --> 00:06:50.035
<i>No matter how much</i>
<i>I push through the branches,</i>

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.370
<i>I can't find the exit.</i>

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:54.456
<i>It's a lonely forest.</i>

00:06:58.043 --> 00:06:59.252
Sorry.

00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:04.758
Hurry.

00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:08.053
Haru.

00:07:08.136 --> 00:07:09.721
<i>This male deer</i>

00:07:10.305 --> 00:07:13.308
<i>looks somewhat sad</i>
<i>even at a time like this.</i>

00:07:14.476 --> 00:07:16.519
<i>He looked the same when we first met.</i>

00:07:19.481 --> 00:07:21.691
<i>It was the spring of tenth grade.</i>

00:07:27.238 --> 00:07:28.907
Sorry to surprise you.

00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:32.577
I shed my antlers
earlier than I expected.

00:07:35.705 --> 00:07:38.166
You're in the gardening club?

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:40.835
Well, yes.

00:07:42.253 --> 00:07:44.756
Promise me that you'll keep this a secret.

00:07:46.716 --> 00:07:48.885
Promise me you'll never tell anyone

00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:51.096
that Rouis' antlers are shed.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.140
Who's Rouis?

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:57.060
You don't know?

00:07:57.936 --> 00:07:59.062
Nope.

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:02.357
You seem very self-conscious.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.610
I'm really busy because
I'm the only active member here.

00:08:08.238 --> 00:08:10.991
That's convenient, then.

00:08:11.074 --> 00:08:12.409
Look.

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:15.745
It takes around ten days
to get fake antlers.

00:08:16.871 --> 00:08:19.374
Lend me this place for ten days.

00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:26.256
I'm not that broke to receive cash
from a bloody deer.

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:29.259
How pathetic. I don't need any money.

00:08:29.968 --> 00:08:31.928
I'll let you stay
under different conditions.

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:34.347
What are the conditions?

00:08:34.431 --> 00:08:36.016
Treating those scars.

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:37.350
TWO DAYS LATER

00:08:37.434 --> 00:08:40.145
No, I have to disinfect it.

00:08:40.228 --> 00:08:41.563
I'll do it myself, then.

00:08:42.564 --> 00:08:45.316
No point acting cool in front of me.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.236
The first time I met you,
you were a blood-soaked Bambi.

00:08:48.319 --> 00:08:49.821
Bambi...

00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:51.364
Come on, stay still.

00:09:00.123 --> 00:09:02.083
Sorry. What am I doing?

00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:04.753
My apologies.

00:09:07.047 --> 00:09:08.256
<i>How many animals...</i>

00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:12.135
<i>have expected perfection from you?</i>

00:09:17.849 --> 00:09:20.518
<i>Our bright, yet pitiful...</i>

00:09:29.319 --> 00:09:32.155
<i>priceless memories</i>
<i>that we made together.</i>

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:34.032
<i>Where would they disappear?</i>

00:09:39.204 --> 00:09:41.081
Will you be at the festival, too?

00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:47.796
I'll sell flowers and plants.
Gotta earn some money for the club.

00:09:47.879 --> 00:09:49.881
I can collect money for you.

00:09:51.382 --> 00:09:53.551
Give me love, not money.

00:09:59.891 --> 00:10:02.727
It's the young one's responsibility
to continue the lineage.

00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:07.607
My fiancÃ©e has already been arranged,
to carry our family name.

00:10:12.403 --> 00:10:14.239
You said you understood.

00:10:16.407 --> 00:10:17.367
I'm going.

00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:21.788
Return to your room by night.

00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:23.832
Fine. See you.

00:10:24.415 --> 00:10:26.000
I'll call you again.

00:10:29.587 --> 00:10:30.797
Rouis?

00:10:33.925 --> 00:10:36.928
STUDENT ID - NAME: LEGOM
CLASSIFICATION: HEN

00:10:39.597 --> 00:10:40.431
Hey.

00:10:42.016 --> 00:10:43.518
Why are you here?

00:10:44.185 --> 00:10:46.396
Same goes for you.

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:49.691
I need to talk to the girl
in the gardening club.

00:10:49.774 --> 00:10:50.775
Haru's not here.

00:10:50.859 --> 00:10:52.026
Haru?

00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:56.197
<i>Calm down. Don't get rattled.</i>

00:10:56.948 --> 00:10:58.783
The gardening club
will be in the festival.

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:01.786
It's the seniors' job to check on them.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:04.247
-I keep her company.
<i>-Company?</i>

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:05.915
I see.

00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:09.460
Sorry. I would've done it
if you'd told me.

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:13.339
So you know Haru, too?

00:11:13.923 --> 00:11:16.885
Yes, kind of. Just a little.

00:11:16.968 --> 00:11:19.429
<i>Why did you come here, Legoshi?</i>

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:21.639
<i>How did this happen?</i>

00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:24.183
You're really...

00:11:24.976 --> 00:11:27.687
You always hang out with the herbivores.

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:30.523
What's your business? I'll tell her.

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:33.443
No, it's fine.

00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:35.737
I just wanted to see her.

00:11:37.113 --> 00:11:40.533
I came here because I wanted to see her.

00:11:41.284 --> 00:11:43.202
<i>What did he just say?</i>

00:11:43.286 --> 00:11:44.662
Are you heading back, too?

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.627
Legoshi.

00:11:56.674 --> 00:12:00.011
<i>Is this for real? A wolf and a rabbit?</i>

00:12:01.512 --> 00:12:05.099
<i>But I don't think</i>
<i>they're sleeping together.</i>

00:12:06.142 --> 00:12:09.562
<i>I assume he's just getting played.</i>

00:12:09.646 --> 00:12:11.105
<i>How unfortunate for him.</i>

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:15.735
<i>What's Haru thinking? Just because</i>
<i>I don't pay enough attention...</i>

00:12:16.861 --> 00:12:18.988
-What are you doing? That's sick.
-Sorry.

00:12:22.367 --> 00:12:23.493
So...

00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:27.163
are you and Haru friends?

00:12:28.498 --> 00:12:31.918
-What did she say?
-Nothing in particular.

00:12:32.543 --> 00:12:34.337
-We're friends, then.
<i>-"Then"?</i>

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.674
Don't you have any crushes?

00:12:38.508 --> 00:12:42.053
I don't know much about those things.

00:12:42.136 --> 00:12:45.139
Why don't you support Juno then?

00:12:46.057 --> 00:12:49.060
Show more affection to your own species.

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:53.982
<i>Poor her, she's been envied</i>
<i>by her peers for her looks.</i>

00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:56.275
<i>Have a talk with her.</i>

00:13:03.157 --> 00:13:06.244
Did I get taller again?

00:13:07.745 --> 00:13:10.123
<i>I don't want to grow anymore.</i>

00:13:11.499 --> 00:13:13.793
<i>Ever since that day at the Black Market,</i>

00:13:13.876 --> 00:13:16.629
<i>I look at mirrors cautiously.</i>

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:21.801
<i>I'm afraid I'm getting</i>
<i>further away from Haru in every way.</i>

00:13:21.884 --> 00:13:24.053
<i>What you're feeling</i>

00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:27.473
<i>is hunting instincts</i>
<i>transformed into love.</i>

00:13:28.891 --> 00:13:32.353
<i>I want to satisfy myself</i>
<i>by forcing her to get closer.</i>

00:13:33.062 --> 00:13:35.857
<i>I guess I do think like a wolf.</i>

00:13:38.067 --> 00:13:39.902
<i>My nails are long.</i>

00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:45.825
Is this some kind of a good luck ritual?

00:13:46.409 --> 00:13:47.952
Juno.

00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:49.954
You're early, Legoshi.

00:13:50.038 --> 00:13:52.415
I have a lot of free time.

00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:54.584
<i>Have a talk with her.</i>

00:13:55.084 --> 00:13:56.085
So...

00:13:57.128 --> 00:13:59.380
are you enjoying the club?

00:14:00.715 --> 00:14:03.760
Are we feared because we're wolves?

00:14:05.303 --> 00:14:09.849
I feel like everyone's avoiding me.
In fact, they chose my role

00:14:09.932 --> 00:14:12.977
for the festival's dance
without my consent.

00:14:13.728 --> 00:14:15.229
I'm a carnivorous dinosaur.

00:14:17.732 --> 00:14:20.068
I guess they're being sarcastic,

00:14:20.985 --> 00:14:24.822
but I promised myself
to dance beautifully until the end.

00:14:25.406 --> 00:14:27.992
<i>Looking at her makes me think</i>

00:14:29.118 --> 00:14:32.372
<i>that the gray wolf is a beautiful animal.</i>

00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:35.583
Would you mind looking at my dance?

00:14:37.001 --> 00:14:40.088
I saw it last year,
so I could give you a bit of advice.

00:14:40.171 --> 00:14:42.840
-Can we do it now?
-Now?

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:47.637
One, two, three.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.555
One, two, three...

00:14:54.143 --> 00:14:55.895
I always get stuck here.

00:14:57.563 --> 00:15:00.024
I've never danced so I'm not so sure.

00:15:08.449 --> 00:15:09.784
<i>Legoshi.</i>

00:15:10.952 --> 00:15:13.955
Pull your wrist a little more
and raise your elbow.

00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:20.044
<i>I was right. He's really handsome.</i>

00:15:21.796 --> 00:15:25.216
<i>Legoshi, do you feel it, too?</i>

00:15:27.593 --> 00:15:32.932
<i>We'd make a perfect gray wolf couple.</i>

00:15:37.979 --> 00:15:39.730
What's this feeling?

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.734
My heart beats faster, but I feel calmer

00:15:43.818 --> 00:15:45.653
every time I touch you.

00:15:46.237 --> 00:15:48.030
I've never felt this way before.

00:15:48.823 --> 00:15:50.741
Is it just me?

00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:53.911
You don't feel anything, Legoshi?

00:15:54.579 --> 00:15:56.747
I know that feeling.

00:15:58.082 --> 00:16:00.543
You will learn about it
in biology next year.

00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:05.715
It's proven that touching animals
of the same species makes you relax.

00:16:06.757 --> 00:16:09.177
You can hold my tail
whenever you're anxious.

00:16:10.511 --> 00:16:13.264
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

00:16:13.347 --> 00:16:16.017
You're both early.

00:16:17.768 --> 00:16:20.730
What?

00:16:23.107 --> 00:16:26.277
<i>I have no idea what to do.</i>

00:16:27.612 --> 00:16:30.114
<i>I have a childhood friend.</i>

00:16:30.198 --> 00:16:35.036
<i>We've been friends for a long time</i>
<i>and I thought I understood him.</i>

00:16:35.953 --> 00:16:39.040
<i>That innocent wolf</i>
<i>who has always been by my side--</i>

00:16:39.582 --> 00:16:42.251
I bumped into a hedgehog in the hallway

00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:43.503
and he stung my shank.

00:16:43.586 --> 00:16:47.423
<i>You'd think he grew</i>
<i>into a mature, young man.</i>

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.512
<i>Who knew he became a total perv!</i>

00:16:53.471 --> 00:16:56.057
<i>Why a rabbit porn mag?</i>

00:16:57.099 --> 00:16:59.727
<i>What do you call this, paraphilia?</i>

00:17:03.272 --> 00:17:04.524
Legoshi.

00:17:05.816 --> 00:17:07.527
We've been...

00:17:08.194 --> 00:17:11.572
friends for a long time, right?

00:17:13.449 --> 00:17:15.701
Yeah. Why are you asking this
out of the blue?

00:17:17.745 --> 00:17:18.996
Well...

00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:22.583
I promise I'll never doubt you

00:17:22.667 --> 00:17:26.128
or think you're gross.

00:17:26.212 --> 00:17:29.632
You just like it, right? Whether
it's a female rabbit or an insect...

00:17:34.428 --> 00:17:37.557
I'm so sorry, I saw it without permission.

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.601
Please, if you're going to be speechless,
close your mouth.

00:17:43.854 --> 00:17:47.900
I wanted to read the manga I lent you,

00:17:48.568 --> 00:17:49.860
and I was looking for that.

00:17:51.362 --> 00:17:54.282
I promise I won't tell anyone.

00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:57.159
But...

00:17:58.244 --> 00:18:01.789
To be honest, ever since
I met this rabbit girl,

00:18:02.415 --> 00:18:04.041
I'm a little confused.

00:18:04.125 --> 00:18:07.336
I thought I should reflect my feelings
for the rabbit

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:10.256
from different perspectives.

00:18:11.632 --> 00:18:14.760
Maybe you like that girl?

00:18:17.179 --> 00:18:21.225
<i>I'm always gasping for breath,</i>
<i>suffering, left in a fix.</i>

00:18:22.393 --> 00:18:25.980
<i>Who can say this is simply love?</i>

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:30.318
<i>I should end this.</i>

00:18:30.401 --> 00:18:31.861
<i>It's not too late yet.</i>

00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:33.029
<i>Legoshi.</i>

00:18:34.905 --> 00:18:36.490
I'm sorry, I...

00:18:37.241 --> 00:18:39.785
No, it's fine.

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:44.206
It's not love. I was just confused.

00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:47.585
Are you sure?

00:18:49.045 --> 00:18:51.213
<i>I'm used to repressing my feelings.</i>

00:18:51.839 --> 00:18:53.549
<i>I even learned to force a smile.</i>

00:18:54.592 --> 00:18:57.553
<i>That's right. I just need to</i>
<i>go back to my old self.</i>

00:18:58.179 --> 00:19:00.348
<i>No ups and downs, live quietly.</i>

00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:03.225
<i>That's how I should be.</i>

00:19:04.101 --> 00:19:05.561
We don't have enough water.

00:19:06.437 --> 00:19:08.773
Is one bucket enough? I'll get it.

00:19:24.914 --> 00:19:26.248
Hey.

00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:30.252
<i>Stay calm. She's just a friend.</i>

00:19:31.087 --> 00:19:33.297
I'm happy to see you outside of school.

00:19:34.632 --> 00:19:35.925
Oh, yeah.

00:19:36.008 --> 00:19:38.177
The gardening club is
participating too, right?

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:42.139
Yeah. It's super busy
because I'm the only member.

00:19:42.223 --> 00:19:44.642
Would you mind helping me out for a bit?

00:19:46.227 --> 00:19:48.229
I'm not sure...

00:19:48.813 --> 00:19:53.067
The drama club is kind of busy, too.
It might be hard.

00:19:53.901 --> 00:19:56.862
I guess everyone's busy. Good luck.

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:05.454
<i>This is how it should be, right?</i>

00:20:07.206 --> 00:20:09.542
<i>This should be</i>
<i>the right distance between...</i>

00:20:10.584 --> 00:20:12.336
<i>a carnivore and a herbivore.</i>

00:20:14.547 --> 00:20:19.844
I can't be lazy when Rouis is here.

00:20:19.927 --> 00:20:22.888
He's here on a whim
and acting like the leader.

00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:24.932
Rehearsing for the lighting ceremony?

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:29.186
Actors don't have a rehearsal today.

00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:52.251
<i>Are you and Haru friends?</i>

00:20:52.835 --> 00:20:54.587
<i>What did she say?</i>

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:56.672
<i>Nothing in particular.</i>

00:20:56.756 --> 00:20:58.174
<i>We're friends, then.</i>

00:21:00.384 --> 00:21:03.637
<i>That moment, I definitely noticed...</i>

00:21:04.805 --> 00:21:08.058
<i>a familiar smell from Rouis.</i>

00:21:10.644 --> 00:21:12.480
<i>I'm always gasping for breath,</i>

00:21:13.272 --> 00:21:15.524
<i>suffering, left in a fix.</i>

00:21:16.817 --> 00:21:18.194
<i>Haru.</i>

00:21:18.277 --> 00:21:19.653
<i>Haru!</i>

00:21:19.737 --> 00:21:21.906
<i>That's a face I've never seen.</i>

00:21:21.989 --> 00:21:23.741
<i>Stop.</i>

00:21:23.824 --> 00:21:28.287
<i>Because I've just realized this</i>
<i>very clearly.</i>

00:21:31.791 --> 00:21:33.083
<i>I...</i>

00:21:33.834 --> 00:21:34.877
<i>love you.</i>

00:23:03.966 --> 00:23:05.968
