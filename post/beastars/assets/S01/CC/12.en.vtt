00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.986
<i>I'll be your beast.</i>

00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:59.119
<i>Our true selves are frozen in time</i>
<i>in this position.</i>

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.123
Legoshi. Sorry...

00:02:04.207 --> 00:02:08.920
My body is moving by itself
trying to get inside your mouth.

00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:11.923
THE RABBIT'S GENE IS BLAMING HER

00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:14.926
"LOVING EACH OTHER IS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE"

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:18.263
I can't believe this.

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.519
A PREDATOR HAS ITS OWN INSTINCTS
SO DOES A PREY

00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:32.402
I'm sorry.

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:37.324
I just couldn't stop myself.

00:02:39.117 --> 00:02:39.951
Don't be.

00:02:40.744 --> 00:02:44.581
I had no idea my body would react
like that. Isn't that weird?

00:02:44.665 --> 00:02:47.501
I'm sorry, too. I didn't mean to...

00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:50.504
THEIR BODIES KNOW
WHAT THEIR RELATIONSHIP SHOULD BE

00:02:50.587 --> 00:02:54.049
No, I was the one who wasn't ready.

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:57.344
We can probably make it work
if we try hard.

00:02:57.427 --> 00:02:58.428
Wanna give it another try?

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:01.098
No, no, no. Of course not!

00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:02.891
Let's stop right here.

00:03:03.475 --> 00:03:08.188
But... I kind of feel bad for you...

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:09.940
Oh, wait!

00:03:10.482 --> 00:03:11.650
Don't worry about me!

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:14.820
Males can calm this thing down
if you just leave them alone.

00:03:16.238 --> 00:03:18.615
Now let's get some sleep! Really.

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:21.910
Don't worry...

00:03:24.246 --> 00:03:27.249
Hey, please don't get down.
You're a man, aren't you?

00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:29.793
No, no, I'm not feeling down.

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:31.628
I'm just...

00:03:32.838 --> 00:03:34.798
<i>What have I done to her?</i>

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.552
<i>I should have been</i>
<i>more considerate towards her.</i>

00:03:40.137 --> 00:03:41.680
I'll wash your shirt for you.

00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:42.723
Cheer up!

00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:45.475
No, I will do that by myself.

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:47.602
This is the least I can do for you now.

00:03:49.521 --> 00:03:51.022
<i>How stupid I am.</i>

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:53.400
<i>Why had I...</i>

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.112
<i>ever have thought</i>
<i>she'd be mine if I saved her?</i>

00:03:58.447 --> 00:04:03.368
IN THE STORM'S WAKE

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:12.919
<i>A living creature's hand is warm.</i>

00:04:14.296 --> 00:04:17.174
<i>I've never thought about that.</i>

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:21.178
<i>All I wanted was to save her.</i>

00:04:22.137 --> 00:04:24.598
<i>I should be happy</i>
<i>that her hand is still warm.</i>

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:31.021
<i>I am truly glad that her hand is warm.</i>

00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:38.069
<i>We left the hotel</i>

00:04:38.153 --> 00:04:41.114
<i>without doing anything after all.</i>

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.867
It's a beautiful day, isn't it?

00:04:46.495 --> 00:04:49.498
I forgot to tell you something important.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.002
Thank you for saving my life.

00:04:58.632 --> 00:05:02.552
-By the way, you were snoring so loudly.
-Sorry.

00:05:02.636 --> 00:05:06.264
<i>I remain like a child</i>
<i>who doesn't know anything,</i>

00:05:07.057 --> 00:05:09.142
<i>and I'm walking with you under the sun.</i>

00:05:12.437 --> 00:05:17.901
I was going to report it to the school
if you were late for another 30 minutes.

00:05:18.693 --> 00:05:20.654
So, you kept it a secret for me?

00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:22.781
I didn't do it for you!

00:05:23.573 --> 00:05:27.994
An injured male Carnivore spending a night
together with a female Herbivore.

00:05:28.078 --> 00:05:30.997
How can I tell that kind of story
to the school?

00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:33.375
Then, will you please tell the school
about us?

00:05:33.458 --> 00:05:36.586
The kidnapping by Shishi-Gumi
and the sleepover did actually happen.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.965
Don't ever mention
such a horrible organization's name again.

00:05:40.465 --> 00:05:43.301
Anyway, a rabbit going out
with a wolf is not acceptable.

00:05:43.385 --> 00:05:44.886
Where did you sleep last night?

00:05:45.804 --> 00:05:48.640
<i>She's only talking about the sleepover.</i>

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:52.394
<i>She doesn't want to talk</i>
<i>about Shishi-Gumi.</i>

00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:54.688
Do you get it? Are you listening to me?

00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:55.730
Excuse me.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.441
Is Legoshi all right?

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:00.277
Hi, are you...

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.444
his junior?

00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:03.363
Yes, I was worried about him.

00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:08.034
Will you please excuse us?

00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:12.205
SCALE FOR SMALL ANIMALS ONLY
GET YOUR FUR CUT TO PREVENT HEATSTROKE

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:14.207
Thank you, Juno.

00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:17.294
I'm sorry for the trouble
right before the performance.

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:18.670
Please don't worry.

00:06:19.296 --> 00:06:20.422
I was certain

00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:23.049
that you'd return safely.

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:25.135
Were you?

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:26.386
Because...

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:29.306
I know better than anyone else in the club

00:06:30.181 --> 00:06:33.268
about the strength of wolves.

00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:34.561
Right.

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:36.313
I see.

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:39.357
<i>Why is he moving back?</i>

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:41.443
I actually

00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:43.445
overheard that

00:06:43.528 --> 00:06:46.323
you saved a rabbit from Shishi-Gumi.

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:48.074
I believe you!

00:06:49.284 --> 00:06:51.578
You told me before,

00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:54.914
touching someone of the same species
would make you relax.

00:06:54.998 --> 00:06:57.292
Now, you need that. Touch me!

00:06:59.002 --> 00:06:59.919
Thank you,

00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:05.008
but somehow, I am very relaxed right now.

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:06.801
<i>What?</i>

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:08.803
<i>Why does he look like,</i>

00:07:08.887 --> 00:07:12.223
<i>"I already belong to that girl,</i>
<i>so no thanks"?</i>

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:19.731
INFIRMARY

00:07:24.986 --> 00:07:29.491
<i>This puny girl flirted with Legoshi!</i>

00:07:29.574 --> 00:07:31.618
Oh, excuse me.

00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:32.786
Would you like to go in?

00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:35.038
Oh, no...

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:37.082
I don't have any business here,
so I'll get going now.

00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:44.839
What the hell do you think you're doing?

00:07:47.926 --> 00:07:50.512
Do you think you can make Legoshi happy?

00:07:51.096 --> 00:07:51.930
What?

00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:56.643
Aren't you being rude
to someone you just met?

00:07:57.143 --> 00:08:00.522
I'm Haru, a senior.
Now tell me who you are.

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:03.149
I'm sorry.

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:05.819
I'm Juno, a freshman.

00:08:06.653 --> 00:08:09.447
<i>Legoshi seems to be more popular</i>
<i>than I thought.</i>

00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:11.825
<i>She's a wolf, too, and very pretty.</i>

00:08:12.534 --> 00:08:16.454
I know that a lot happened
between you and Legoshi last night.

00:08:17.747 --> 00:08:19.582
Yeah, right.

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:23.545
But our relationship isn't as simple
as you think. So, don't worry.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.799
Will I make Legoshi happy?

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:33.680
Well, since a girl like you is into him,
he should already be happy.

00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:38.351
What?

00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:41.896
Hey... What are you...

00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:49.362
<i>What the hell? Why am I attracting wolves</i>
<i>two days in a row?</i>

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.741
Okay, I see now.

00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:55.076
I figured it out from your smell.

00:08:56.244 --> 00:08:58.121
You didn't have sex with him.

00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:00.081
Of course you didn't.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.462
Did you think I was going to eat you?

00:09:09.632 --> 00:09:11.384
I don't have to eat you to defeat you.

00:09:11.885 --> 00:09:14.888
I will win as a female.

00:09:17.265 --> 00:09:20.769
I will prove it to you
at the Festival of the Meteor.

00:09:28.359 --> 00:09:31.613
You can leave
after you take this stuff out.

00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:32.864
Why?

00:09:32.947 --> 00:09:34.491
Why do you even ask?

00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:37.410
Can you do the stage lighting duty
with those injuries?

00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:40.705
Sure. I don't need any rest.

00:09:40.789 --> 00:09:44.751
I'm saying, we're too busy to care
for someone wounded.

00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:47.170
-It's what we, the art team all agreed on.
-Again?

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:51.466
We've had so many changes
since Rouis disappeared.

00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:52.550
He's gone?

00:09:52.634 --> 00:09:55.345
We can't get ahold of him at all.

00:09:55.845 --> 00:09:58.640
He has never done
anything like this before.

00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:05.063
<i>I think it's my fault.</i>

00:10:06.689 --> 00:10:08.525
<i>I want to talk to him.</i>

00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:11.736
Juno?

00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:26.918
STUDENT ID - NAME: TEM
CLASSIFICATION: ALPACA

00:10:29.212 --> 00:10:32.423
I have changed my costume
and the make-up a little bit.

00:10:33.091 --> 00:10:37.178
As Rouis is absent,
we need to unite our spirits as one.

00:10:37.262 --> 00:10:40.223
Let's make a great performance
and surprise the audience.

00:10:42.725 --> 00:10:44.310
Let's have a blast!

00:10:44.394 --> 00:10:47.397
-She's right.
-Yes, we can do this!

00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:51.901
<i>I feel like something is changing.</i>

00:10:52.819 --> 00:10:57.073
<i>Whether it's for better or worse,</i>
<i>each one of us will decide.</i>

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:01.244
<i>No matter what, I have faith in her.</i>

00:11:02.787 --> 00:11:03.705
Good luck!

00:11:09.043 --> 00:11:11.546
Kai, I'll be counting on you.

00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:13.548
Sure, leave it to me.

00:11:15.884 --> 00:11:18.011
<i>Even if our surroundings</i>
<i>constantly change,</i>

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:22.015
<i>I can keep being myself</i>

00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:25.727
<i>as long as you stay with me, Haru.</i>

00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:32.817
<i>I asked her to meet me in the evening</i>
<i>because I have something to tell her,</i>

00:11:33.902 --> 00:11:36.154
<i>but she may not remember it.</i>

00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:40.283
<i>I've been through a lot.</i>

00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:45.496
<i>I feel like I've been through both ideal</i>
<i>and reality in 24 hours.</i>

00:11:46.664 --> 00:11:48.374
<i>I feel weak at the knees</i>

00:11:48.875 --> 00:11:50.251
<i>and can't move on anymore.</i>

00:11:52.211 --> 00:11:55.381
Hey, the performance by Cherryton School
is starting now.

00:12:11.397 --> 00:12:12.565
Who is she?

00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:14.317
She's so pretty!

00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:38.341
<i>Carnivores are so strong.</i>

00:12:40.009 --> 00:12:41.219
<i>They are pretty,</i>

00:12:42.178 --> 00:12:43.471
<i>and special like she is.</i>

00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:48.059
<i>I was not scared</i>
<i>of being loved by Legoshi,</i>

00:12:49.268 --> 00:12:50.645
<i>nor being eaten by him.</i>

00:12:52.397 --> 00:12:55.525
<i>I was just scared to admit</i>
<i>that I'm just a puny rabbit,</i>

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:57.110
<i>so I've been avoiding him.</i>

00:12:58.361 --> 00:13:01.572
<i>You're the only one who recognized</i>
<i>a rabbit like me in this world.</i>

00:13:02.323 --> 00:13:04.033
<i>You are responsible for it, Legoshi.</i>

00:13:06.703 --> 00:13:08.579
<i>I can no longer live without you.</i>

00:13:09.414 --> 00:13:11.082
<i>You idiot wolf...</i>

00:13:11.666 --> 00:13:14.127
<i>I can't find her. Where is she?</i>

00:13:15.086 --> 00:13:17.130
<i>Could she be kidnapped again?</i>

00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:18.965
<i>Where is she?</i>

00:13:20.425 --> 00:13:21.884
<i>I don't want to miss her again.</i>

00:13:22.969 --> 00:13:24.303
<i>Thirty feet away...</i>

00:13:25.013 --> 00:13:27.807
<i>No, it can be farther than that.</i>
<i>65 feet?</i>

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:30.143
<i>Has she left the venue?</i>

00:13:30.685 --> 00:13:31.728
<i>Haru...</i>

00:13:34.439 --> 00:13:36.065
Is your nose working all right?

00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:48.911
Haru.

00:13:49.704 --> 00:13:51.039
-I...
-Wait.

00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:54.125
Let me say this first.

00:13:55.793 --> 00:13:56.794
I...

00:13:58.004 --> 00:13:59.005
I...

00:13:59.088 --> 00:14:00.715
Thank you very much, everyone.

00:14:01.215 --> 00:14:04.427
Please let me introduce to you
one of our club members now.

00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:08.473
He is a brave male wolf!

00:14:15.313 --> 00:14:19.567
He searched for a missing student
and risked his own life

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:21.402
to rescue her.

00:14:22.445 --> 00:14:26.449
He acted so bravely as a Carnivore.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:30.578
Legoshi.

00:14:31.287 --> 00:14:32.663
Please come up here.

00:14:34.999 --> 00:14:36.376
What's going on?

00:14:46.677 --> 00:14:47.887
Hey, Juno.

00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:49.889
You didn't tell me
anything about this.

00:14:51.474 --> 00:14:52.392
He...

00:14:52.975 --> 00:14:55.186
risked his own life to rescue

00:14:55.812 --> 00:14:58.606
one of the Herbivore students
of Cherryton School.

00:14:59.774 --> 00:15:01.275
It is so natural

00:15:01.359 --> 00:15:04.904
that Carnivores always want
to help Herbivores

00:15:05.488 --> 00:15:06.948
because they are stronger.

00:15:07.448 --> 00:15:08.991
It's a simple compassion.

00:15:09.492 --> 00:15:11.035
<i>No, she's wrong!</i>

00:15:11.619 --> 00:15:13.413
<i>I've seen the horrors...</i>

00:15:13.496 --> 00:15:15.415
I'd like you all to understand.

00:15:15.498 --> 00:15:18.167
<i>...of the Carnivores' instincts</i>
<i>with my own eyes.</i>

00:15:18.251 --> 00:15:21.087
The potential hidden
inside their physical strength

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:22.755
is more precious than you realize!

00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:29.137
This is the nature of Carnivores!

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:36.102
She's amazing.

00:15:36.185 --> 00:15:38.146
Look at his bruised eye.

00:15:38.229 --> 00:15:40.148
They are young but remarkable.

00:15:41.149 --> 00:15:43.276
I'm so happy, and I hope that

00:15:43.985 --> 00:15:47.572
the world becomes a better place
even gradually.

00:15:48.406 --> 00:15:50.658
I've been longing for it
since I was little.

00:15:52.076 --> 00:15:55.872
Oh, let's go to light
a candle together, Legoshi.

00:15:56.581 --> 00:15:57.457
Hey!

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:06.340
You have to do this with someone you love.

00:16:06.424 --> 00:16:07.884
People will misunderstand us.

00:16:08.384 --> 00:16:10.178
Especially after standing out like that.

00:16:10.261 --> 00:16:11.721
I won't be misunderstood.

00:16:14.265 --> 00:16:15.600
Legoshi.

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:18.102
The strength of Carnivores

00:16:18.603 --> 00:16:21.355
does not shine in the shadows.

00:16:22.064 --> 00:16:23.357
You know what I mean.

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:27.862
No matter how much you fight
in the darkness of society,

00:16:28.446 --> 00:16:30.948
it will be just a burden on you.

00:16:32.033 --> 00:16:33.701
You'll be feared and hated,

00:16:34.285 --> 00:16:36.621
and you'll be overwhelmed
by your own strength.

00:16:37.497 --> 00:16:39.957
I don't want to see you
get hurt like that.

00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:42.543
Let's go...

00:16:43.753 --> 00:16:45.880
into the light together.

00:16:50.551 --> 00:16:53.387
<i>Juno is really something.</i>

00:16:54.555 --> 00:16:57.058
<i>I'm used to enduring bullying,</i>

00:16:57.141 --> 00:16:59.227
<i>but looking at them together</i>
<i>was pretty tough...</i>

00:17:00.019 --> 00:17:03.940
<i>because they looked so perfect</i>
<i>for each other.</i>

00:17:05.107 --> 00:17:08.736
<i>They looked so good that those townsfolks</i>
<i>clapped their hands for them.</i>

00:17:10.279 --> 00:17:13.533
<i>No one will bless the relationship</i>
<i>between a wolf and a rabbit.</i>

00:17:14.158 --> 00:17:18.287
<i>Anyway, I don't have the right</i>
<i>to make Legoshi mine.</i>

00:17:19.038 --> 00:17:22.041
<i>I can just back off, then everything</i>
<i>should be alright.</i>

00:17:22.667 --> 00:17:24.544
<i>-It should be...</i>
-Haru!

00:17:25.044 --> 00:17:26.254
<i>...that...</i>

00:17:26.337 --> 00:17:27.922
-Haru!
<i>-...simple...</i>

00:17:28.506 --> 00:17:29.340
Haru.

00:17:29.882 --> 00:17:32.176
It's not safe to walk alone at night.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.513
<i>This guy really makes</i>
<i>everything complicated!</i>

00:17:36.097 --> 00:17:38.516
What are you doing here?
Did you just leave her alone?

00:17:38.599 --> 00:17:39.767
What?

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:43.688
You heard the applause.
You two are a perfect match!

00:17:44.272 --> 00:17:45.106
What?

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.233
Are you stupid?

00:17:47.775 --> 00:17:49.068
Will you just leave me alone?

00:17:51.112 --> 00:17:53.072
She is just my junior.

00:17:53.155 --> 00:17:55.366
Sure, we're both gray wolves,

00:17:55.449 --> 00:17:58.202
but I think we have
very different ways of thinking.

00:17:59.036 --> 00:18:00.246
I'm...

00:18:00.913 --> 00:18:02.623
basically pessimistic,

00:18:03.124 --> 00:18:05.585
so it doesn't matter
if I'm in the light or in the shadow,

00:18:05.668 --> 00:18:07.962
I will always have some worries.

00:18:08.045 --> 00:18:10.131
So, if I keep worrying in the dark

00:18:10.631 --> 00:18:12.383
like I've been doing all these years,

00:18:12.466 --> 00:18:15.803
I want you to be a part of my worries.

00:18:15.886 --> 00:18:18.180
That way, it'd be worth worrying.

00:18:18.681 --> 00:18:21.309
But I feel so bad that you almost
got killed because of me.

00:18:21.809 --> 00:18:25.187
And I don't want to cause you
any more female-related trauma.

00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:29.442
You must have been hurt from what happened
at the hotel last night.

00:18:29.942 --> 00:18:31.861
Well... Yeah...

00:18:32.361 --> 00:18:35.323
Those kinds of problems are common,
I think.

00:18:35.823 --> 00:18:38.701
No, that was an emergency situation.

00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:41.287
I tried to get eaten by you.

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:43.748
Yeah, right.

00:18:44.498 --> 00:18:47.126
It's not a matter of male and female.
You are a wolf,

00:18:47.209 --> 00:18:49.253
and I'm a rabbit! This fact won't change!

00:18:54.175 --> 00:18:55.384
To tell you the truth,

00:18:57.053 --> 00:18:59.639
when you were abducted by Shishi-Gumi,

00:19:01.015 --> 00:19:03.684
I felt like they took away my prey.

00:19:05.227 --> 00:19:08.898
To be honest, I was confused
with my feelings and felt so nervous.

00:19:10.107 --> 00:19:11.734
I wondered...

00:19:13.027 --> 00:19:15.071
why I wanted to save you.

00:19:16.906 --> 00:19:17.907
But,

00:19:18.574 --> 00:19:19.867
I know how I feel now.

00:19:20.451 --> 00:19:22.703
I will never eat you! Because--

00:19:22.787 --> 00:19:23.788
Don't.

00:19:24.664 --> 00:19:26.791
How can you be so sure about that?

00:19:26.874 --> 00:19:28.793
That's what I'm going to tell you now!

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:35.091
<i>The more honest Legoshi becomes </i>
<i>about his feelings,</i>

00:19:35.174 --> 00:19:37.385
<i>the harder it gets to contain</i>
<i>my feelings for him.</i>

00:19:37.885 --> 00:19:41.597
There's no guarantee
that a wolf won't eat a rabbit!

00:19:41.681 --> 00:19:43.599
We can't get any closer to each other!

00:19:44.266 --> 00:19:46.727
<i>I hate to get hurt like this.</i>

00:19:47.311 --> 00:19:49.563
<i>I'd rather be eaten by you.</i>

00:19:50.314 --> 00:19:53.484
Maybe there's no guarantee,
but I have a reason to stay with you!

00:19:53.567 --> 00:19:54.735
It's so simple, but...

00:19:57.405 --> 00:19:58.614
<i>Why?</i>

00:20:06.706 --> 00:20:08.499
Because I love you.

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:14.004
Haru...

00:20:22.096 --> 00:20:23.097
I will get

00:20:24.265 --> 00:20:26.016
stronger.

00:20:28.018 --> 00:20:30.771
Because I want to make you happy

00:20:31.647 --> 00:20:34.442
without getting defeated
by this society or my instinct.

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.319
I will get stronger.

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:42.241
I'll be waiting for you.

00:21:10.311 --> 00:21:14.440
FLOWER SHOP
BE BACK SOON

00:21:21.697 --> 00:21:24.950
IF YOU GET A GIRLFRIEND,
YOU'LL BE ON CLEANING DUTY FOREVER

00:21:43.302 --> 00:21:46.180
ROUIS THE RED DEER MISSING!

00:21:51.143 --> 00:21:53.979
Legoshi, how was the summer,

00:21:54.063 --> 00:21:55.231
overall?

00:21:55.731 --> 00:21:57.441
This summer...

00:22:00.528 --> 00:22:02.738
I didn't eat watermelon.

00:22:03.239 --> 00:22:04.240
What?

00:22:05.282 --> 00:22:06.742
Why don't we go get some?

00:22:07.618 --> 00:22:08.828
Let's go.

00:22:12.248 --> 00:22:13.541
Hey...

00:22:17.127 --> 00:22:20.297
<i>I will, but don't rush.</i>

00:22:45.489 --> 00:22:48.242
There you are. We've been looking for you.

00:22:49.451 --> 00:22:50.494
Let's go.

00:22:58.877 --> 00:23:00.129
What's funny?

00:23:04.883 --> 00:23:05.884
