00:00:19.978 --> 00:00:21.438
<i>I don't want to get up.</i>

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:26.735
<i>I didn't even sleep a wink, though.</i>

00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:32.574
<i>I don't want to get up or sleep.</i>

00:00:33.408 --> 00:00:36.495
<i>I just want to stay still here</i>
<i>like a shellfish.</i>

00:00:40.624 --> 00:00:41.667
Legoshi!

00:00:43.919 --> 00:00:45.796
You have to get up already.

00:00:46.797 --> 00:00:49.633
You look scary. It's time to get up now.

00:00:50.384 --> 00:00:52.386
Hey, Legoshi!

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.722
I bet you didn't study
for today's math quiz, either.

00:00:55.806 --> 00:00:56.640
Yeah.

00:00:57.224 --> 00:00:59.184
I totally understand how you feel.

00:00:59.268 --> 00:01:01.520
Get dressed, and let's go.

00:01:01.603 --> 00:01:02.437
Okay!

00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:05.899
<i>No, something is wrong with him.</i>

00:01:06.817 --> 00:01:09.653
<i>His gloominess is way worse than usual.</i>

00:02:52.631 --> 00:02:53.924
<i>Is this sound...</i>

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:55.592
<i>mine?</i>

00:02:56.968 --> 00:02:57.969
<i>Yours?</i>

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:02.474
<i>She is really warm and tiny.</i>

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:07.813
<i>She moves a lot,</i>
<i>and my arm gets wet with her breath.</i>

00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:10.816
<i>Under these clothes,</i>

00:03:11.817 --> 00:03:16.029
<i>under this... soft fur, there's...</i>

00:03:16.613 --> 00:03:19.074
<i>Stop it! But how?</i>

00:03:19.157 --> 00:03:21.910
<i>How... How...</i>

00:03:22.786 --> 00:03:26.081
<i>The warm juiciness</i>
<i>which would fill my mouth...</i>

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.501
<i>My body, my hands...</i>

00:03:30.752 --> 00:03:32.295
<i>They don't stop.</i>

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.965
<i>That's the right thing.</i>

00:03:44.725 --> 00:03:50.188
<i>You've been struggling like that</i>
<i>for a long, long time,</i>

00:03:50.272 --> 00:03:52.858
<i>but you have almost reached your limit.</i>

00:04:01.283 --> 00:04:04.619
Go away. Stop it!

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:08.623
<i>You've suppressed yourself</i>
<i>since you were little,</i>

00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:15.839
<i>and lived in the shadow quietly.</i>

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:18.633
<i>Are you sad?</i>

00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:21.511
<i>Or frustrated?</i>

00:04:21.595 --> 00:04:22.596
Stop it!

00:04:23.555 --> 00:04:25.474
<i>Neither is correct.</i>

00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:30.479
<i>You are delighted</i>
<i>from the bottom of your heart.</i>

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:33.899
Stop it. No.

00:04:33.982 --> 00:04:36.359
<i>Look at yourself.</i>

00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:39.613
<i>You can't look away from yourself.</i>

00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:43.074
<i>It's getting bigger and bigger. See?</i>

00:04:43.867 --> 00:04:46.328
I will not see it! Get lost!

00:04:46.912 --> 00:04:49.539
<i>You must be ready.</i>

00:04:49.623 --> 00:04:52.584
<i>The fun has just begun.</i>

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.338
<i>Finish her with a single bite!</i>

00:04:57.255 --> 00:05:00.801
Damn. How dare...

00:05:00.884 --> 00:05:03.762
<i>You waited for 17 years...</i>

00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:08.016
<i>to taste it.</i>

00:05:08.767 --> 00:05:12.687
Please stop it. Leave me alone!

00:05:12.771 --> 00:05:16.107
Give me that!

00:05:17.192 --> 00:05:19.110
<i>It must be tender...</i>

00:05:22.614 --> 00:05:24.616
<i>I'll eat you!</i>

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.453
Legoshi!

00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:31.832
We've got a problem!

00:05:46.137 --> 00:05:47.472
Are you all right?

00:05:47.556 --> 00:05:48.890
It's nothing.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.436
He tried to help me.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.940
<i>It was so dark</i>
<i>that I wasn't able to see the floor.</i>

00:05:58.942 --> 00:06:03.947
"Even my body disappears
into the air someday, my water spirit--"

00:06:10.954 --> 00:06:16.126
If Rouis can't perform, what should I do?

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:17.127
Cut it out.

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:21.256
It'll be healed by tomorrow.
This pain won't last.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.594
Give me your shoulder to lean on, Legoshi.

00:06:25.677 --> 00:06:26.511
Yes.

00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:33.518
Thank you for watching out there.

00:06:34.102 --> 00:06:35.312
Not at all.

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:36.730
Any problems?

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:42.527
<i>No.</i>

00:06:57.584 --> 00:07:01.463
Let's see, what is today's breakfast
for carnivores?

00:07:01.546 --> 00:07:04.090
Bread, scrambled eggs, and soy burgers!

00:07:04.174 --> 00:07:05.508
Yeah! That's my favorite!

00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:07.469
HERBIVORE: SOY MILK,
TOFU DONUTS, STEAMED VEGETABLES

00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:09.054
<i>At this boarding school,</i>

00:07:09.638 --> 00:07:12.849
<i>students must eat three times a day</i>
<i>in the cafeteria.</i>

00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:17.896
<i>Not to mention, eating meat is</i>
<i>strictly prohibited in this world.</i>

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:23.109
<i>Meat is never on the menus here</i>
<i>or at any restaurants.</i>

00:07:23.193 --> 00:07:24.361
BREAKFAST FOR HERBIVORES

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:29.199
<i>Instead, tastes and nutrition are well</i>
<i>considered to meet all animals' needs.</i>

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:30.450
BREAKFAST FOR CARNIVORES

00:07:37.082 --> 00:07:38.750
Sorry, go ahead.

00:07:40.001 --> 00:07:40.835
Thank you.

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:44.255
Man! That was close!

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:47.092
I almost stepped on a rodent girl.

00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:50.011
I need new glasses.

00:07:50.095 --> 00:07:51.054
Oh, gosh.

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:54.516
If I was a few steps behind,
I would have been smashed.

00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:57.310
We tiny ones must walk along the walls.

00:07:57.394 --> 00:08:03.316
Legoshi, you said
I would look good with glasses, right?

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.818
I was happy to hear that.

00:08:05.694 --> 00:08:07.404
<i>I'd better not eat this one.</i>

00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:10.991
<i>My hand still remembers</i>
<i>how she felt last night.</i>

00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:15.245
<i>I don't want to touch anything soft.</i>

00:08:16.413 --> 00:08:18.832
You! Stop pissing me off!

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:21.918
Didn't you realize
that you stepped on my tail, idiot?

00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:24.254
I said sorry, didn't I, you asshole?

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:27.465
Don't say sorry while you laugh foolishly!

00:08:27.549 --> 00:08:31.720
Is the line on your face
because of your stress?

00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:38.768
Screw you! Stop biting my arm!

00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:40.770
Don't you understand what you are doing?

00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:44.274
Let go of me!

00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:45.775
Shut up!

00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:48.069
I'll eat you!

00:08:48.778 --> 00:08:51.239
I'll eat you!

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:56.369
<i>You are delighted</i>
<i>from the bottom of your heart. </i>

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:04.419
Stop it!

00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:14.637
What's wrong with you, really, Legoshi?

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:16.681
Who the hell are you?

00:09:17.682 --> 00:09:21.519
Just because you're bigger than me,
you thought you could beat me?

00:09:21.603 --> 00:09:22.687
Of course not.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.689
No, no, no.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.441
<i>Okay, think.</i>

00:09:26.524 --> 00:09:28.860
THE POWER OF THE BITE: 660 LBS
CLAW: 2.5 IN. - HEIGHT: 6.1 FT.

00:09:28.943 --> 00:09:30.779
What can I do
to make myself lose on purpose?

00:09:30.862 --> 00:09:31.988
What do you mean, "No"?

00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:33.907
THE POWER OF THE BITE: 331 LBS
CLAW: 1.2 IN. - WEIGHT: 121 LBS

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.786
Give me your neck. I can bite you softly.

00:09:37.869 --> 00:09:41.289
<i>Right, I can drop coins from my pocket</i>
<i>and pretend to pick them up...</i>

00:09:41.372 --> 00:09:42.749
Oh, dear!

00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:45.335
Being a carnivore is not so easy, is it?

00:09:49.214 --> 00:09:50.173
So cool!

00:09:52.842 --> 00:09:57.388
Personality doesn't always match power.

00:09:58.014 --> 00:10:01.059
Well, well, here is a star actor,

00:10:01.142 --> 00:10:03.269
Master Rouis.

00:10:03.853 --> 00:10:06.648
Showing your teeth in public
is intolerable.

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:10.485
You must be busy,

00:10:10.568 --> 00:10:13.738
since you're aiming for the next Beastar.

00:10:14.322 --> 00:10:18.201
You need to put in a lot of effort
to attract people.

00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:21.621
THE HEROIC TITLE OF NEXT BEASTAR

00:10:21.704 --> 00:10:25.250
<i>Beastar. Any animal knows the title.</i>

00:10:26.084 --> 00:10:28.336
<i>He exercises leadership over the students</i>

00:10:28.419 --> 00:10:32.799
<i>and transcends discrimination and fear</i>
<i>of this world as a hero.</i>

00:10:34.092 --> 00:10:38.596
Have you ever thought
about why we need a Beastar in this world?

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:42.517
Get over your jealousy
and get yourself straightened out.

00:10:43.184 --> 00:10:45.019
-Go wash your fangs with soap!
-Yeah!

00:10:45.103 --> 00:10:46.187
Get lost!

00:10:46.271 --> 00:10:47.772
Let's get outta here.

00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:52.569
How impressive!
You know how to gain popularity.

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:55.029
That's enough. Let's go.

00:10:55.113 --> 00:10:56.447
Shut up!

00:10:58.992 --> 00:11:01.828
Everyone, please go back to your meal.

00:11:07.292 --> 00:11:10.545
Did I pay you back for last night?

00:11:12.589 --> 00:11:14.507
That...

00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:16.259
was nothing.

00:11:17.093 --> 00:11:19.596
Thank you very much, Rouis.

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:20.889
If you weren't--

00:11:20.972 --> 00:11:25.560
You had to act like a loser, right?

00:11:29.063 --> 00:11:32.775
How long will you fake your personality?

00:11:33.568 --> 00:11:37.155
It seems like you're a worse wolf
than I thought.

00:11:46.122 --> 00:11:48.917
<i>If he is the justice,</i>

00:11:50.293 --> 00:11:51.586
<i>I'm...</i>

00:11:56.883 --> 00:11:59.886
STUDENT ID - NAME: HARU
CLASSIFICATION: NETHERLAND DWARF

00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:09.312
Mr. Reaper, why are they chasing me?

00:12:09.395 --> 00:12:12.482
Because you were supposed to die
three days ago.

00:12:14.943 --> 00:12:17.111
Water, wind, fire...

00:12:17.195 --> 00:12:20.740
Messengers of all the elements
want you dead.

00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:24.327
This is the result of living
against your fate.

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:27.538
No worries. I can take care of it.

00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:31.709
I will kill you. It's my duty.

00:12:32.293 --> 00:12:35.672
Until then, I won't let anyone touch you!

00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:36.589
Okay!

00:12:37.465 --> 00:12:39.801
Act 1, scene 5 is okay!

00:12:39.884 --> 00:12:42.095
-Let's take a break.
-What?

00:12:44.138 --> 00:12:47.266
You look a little sluggish.
Are you feeling all right?

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:48.768
Stop whispering.

00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:50.520
I'm fine.

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:53.940
The welcome event is
the most crucial opportunity for us.

00:12:54.023 --> 00:12:58.486
We need to show the importance
of this drama club to freshmen.

00:12:58.569 --> 00:13:00.905
It's not the time to care how I feel.

00:13:00.989 --> 00:13:02.281
Am I right?

00:13:03.366 --> 00:13:04.575
Yes, I think so.

00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:06.869
Get more serious about it.

00:13:06.953 --> 00:13:09.330
I, a herbivore, am going to play Adler.

00:13:10.123 --> 00:13:13.459
You, carnivores, attack me
with your full strength.

00:13:14.043 --> 00:13:16.963
We will show what all that means
on this stage.

00:13:17.547 --> 00:13:19.716
We have to be more fierce this year.

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.970
The club president stopped
in the middle of the run-through?

00:13:24.053 --> 00:13:26.472
Damn! I was going to perform, too!

00:13:26.556 --> 00:13:28.933
Why should I be doing needlework?

00:13:29.017 --> 00:13:31.811
But you are pretty good at sewing, Kai.

00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:33.604
You think?

00:13:33.688 --> 00:13:35.648
-Yes.
-For real? Yeah!

00:13:35.732 --> 00:13:36.566
This...

00:13:38.151 --> 00:13:40.611
This... is Tem's.

00:13:41.362 --> 00:13:42.822
What should we do with that?

00:13:42.905 --> 00:13:45.908
Keeping his costume is
kind of creepy, isn't it?

00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:46.826
Hey.

00:13:47.702 --> 00:13:49.537
<i>Tem, an alpaca,</i>

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:52.915
<i>was murdered by one of the carnivores</i>
<i>at this school.</i>

00:13:54.459 --> 00:13:58.588
<i>It's the heaviest taboo of this world.</i>

00:13:59.756 --> 00:14:03.843
<i>Therefore, no one wants to talk</i>
<i>about the incident any more.</i>

00:14:05.386 --> 00:14:09.140
<i>I think I understand</i>
<i>what he said earlier now.</i>

00:14:11.976 --> 00:14:15.813
<i>The meaning of Rouis, who is a deer,</i>
<i>playing the strong Adler.</i>

00:14:20.151 --> 00:14:23.321
<i>I believe he is trying to face</i>
<i>the incident more seriously</i>

00:14:23.404 --> 00:14:25.073
<i>than anyone else.</i>

00:14:25.156 --> 00:14:27.909
We'll resume from act 1, scene 6!

00:14:27.992 --> 00:14:30.203
-Lights are ready.
-Okay.

00:14:30.286 --> 00:14:31.788
Sound is ready, too.

00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:32.872
All right!

00:14:40.338 --> 00:14:41.506
Let's do it.

00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:47.011
<i>He must be under huge pressure.</i>

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:48.930
Legoshi.

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:50.515
Legoshi!

00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:52.558
Yes.

00:14:52.642 --> 00:14:53.851
Oh, dear.

00:14:53.935 --> 00:14:57.105
We were talking about asking
the gardening club for some flowers.

00:14:57.939 --> 00:14:59.232
Look.

00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:02.235
I'd like to decorate the hall with roses,

00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:04.821
inspired by the image of the last scene.

00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:06.739
Will you go ask for their help?

00:15:07.323 --> 00:15:08.616
To the gardening club?

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.160
That's a club for herbivores, right?

00:15:11.744 --> 00:15:13.246
Will they be all right if I come?

00:15:13.329 --> 00:15:14.580
That is why!

00:15:14.664 --> 00:15:18.793
Since you're already a junior, you should
improve your communication skills.

00:15:18.876 --> 00:15:20.086
Okay, then.

00:15:20.878 --> 00:15:21.712
What?

00:15:24.882 --> 00:15:27.093
Do I really need to be here with you?

00:15:27.176 --> 00:15:29.762
If a wolf suddenly shows up
and demands flowers,

00:15:29.846 --> 00:15:31.556
they'll be scared.

00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:36.394
I can smell fragrant flowers.

00:15:40.106 --> 00:15:41.607
<i>That's the girl from that night!</i>

00:15:56.038 --> 00:15:59.876
<i>I didn't realize</i>
<i>that she's such a tiny rabbit.</i>

00:16:02.044 --> 00:16:03.921
<i>The garden of evil.</i>

00:16:05.131 --> 00:16:06.507
Can I help you?

00:16:07.091 --> 00:16:09.177
<i>Oh, no. I have to leave now.</i>

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:13.848
<i>Well... What? I have a stomachache?</i>
<i>Or I just have to go to the bathroom?</i>

00:16:13.931 --> 00:16:17.643
<i>I can't think of any good excuses</i>
<i>other than "I forgot to do something."</i>

00:16:17.727 --> 00:16:19.103
I--

00:16:19.187 --> 00:16:21.147
Shoot! I forgot to do something!

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:24.233
Oh, no, I have to leave now.

00:16:25.276 --> 00:16:26.152
Hey!

00:16:26.235 --> 00:16:28.446
I'll treat you an ant shake next time.

00:16:28.529 --> 00:16:31.616
-I'll leave it to you. Thanks!
-I thought you came here

00:16:31.699 --> 00:16:35.578
for some flowers to use
at the welcome event,

00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:36.704
didn't you?

00:16:36.787 --> 00:16:39.832
Yeah, that's right, but...

00:16:39.916 --> 00:16:42.043
Ask this wolf for the details.

00:16:42.126 --> 00:16:43.002
See you!

00:16:49.634 --> 00:16:52.428
<i>We are alone.</i>

00:16:54.347 --> 00:16:57.391
Rumors spread fast,
especially the bad one.

00:16:57.475 --> 00:16:59.227
Did I scare him?

00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:02.271
Aren't you scared?

00:17:03.105 --> 00:17:03.940
No.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.859
<i>I tried to eat you.</i>

00:17:07.485 --> 00:17:12.823
<i>Far from being scared of you,</i>
<i>I don't even have a right to talk to you.</i>

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:18.579
So, you need some roses.

00:17:18.663 --> 00:17:20.623
We have several kinds, so take a look.

00:17:21.457 --> 00:17:22.583
Thanks.

00:17:23.167 --> 00:17:24.544
What club do you belong to?

00:17:25.044 --> 00:17:28.172
I belong to the drama club.
I'm working behind the scenes.

00:17:28.923 --> 00:17:31.133
We need roses to decorate the hall.

00:17:33.553 --> 00:17:35.972
<i>There's a huge distance between our heads.</i>

00:17:36.639 --> 00:17:40.560
<i>I might have never talked to</i>
<i>smaller animals face-to-face before.</i>

00:17:40.643 --> 00:17:42.395
One condition.

00:17:42.478 --> 00:17:43.312
Condition?

00:17:43.396 --> 00:17:44.355
<i>Oh, my...</i>

00:17:45.356 --> 00:17:48.734
I can't offer my precious flowers
for free.

00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:51.571
Can you carry them to the back?

00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:54.907
What?

00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:59.579
I don't want your big tail
to break the planters.

00:17:59.662 --> 00:18:02.039
<i>She touched me.</i>

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:05.209
Don't worry. I won't cut it off.

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:09.088
What grade are you in?

00:18:09.171 --> 00:18:10.339
I'm a junior.

00:18:10.423 --> 00:18:13.759
So, you are one year younger,
but you don't have to be polite to me.

00:18:14.385 --> 00:18:15.303
Okay.

00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:21.392
Any other members?

00:18:21.976 --> 00:18:25.605
Since the other ones graduated
four years ago, I've been all by myself.

00:18:31.068 --> 00:18:32.570
It must be hard.

00:18:33.696 --> 00:18:35.406
Yeah, kind of.

00:18:35.489 --> 00:18:38.284
But these flowers need me.

00:18:39.076 --> 00:18:40.828
And I need them, too.

00:18:42.288 --> 00:18:43.831
The weak ones like us

00:18:44.832 --> 00:18:47.460
must help each other.

00:18:48.502 --> 00:18:51.005
If we dig our heels in,

00:18:51.088 --> 00:18:53.674
we may even risk our lives.

00:19:01.641 --> 00:19:03.184
Well...

00:19:03.267 --> 00:19:05.227
<i>No! Don't ask her anything!</i>

00:19:05.311 --> 00:19:06.854
What...

00:19:06.937 --> 00:19:08.939
<i>Why do you even ask? Don't!</i>

00:19:09.023 --> 00:19:10.650
...happened to...

00:19:10.733 --> 00:19:11.859
<i>Hey!</i>

00:19:13.235 --> 00:19:14.070
...your left arm?

00:19:16.197 --> 00:19:17.323
This?

00:19:18.866 --> 00:19:20.660
I don't know.

00:19:21.243 --> 00:19:23.954
It hurts quite a bit, but I can't recall.

00:19:24.038 --> 00:19:25.414
You can't?

00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:26.499
No.

00:19:26.582 --> 00:19:29.919
But, a smaller animal with bandage on

00:19:30.002 --> 00:19:33.673
is kind of bad luck in this world,
isn't it?

00:19:35.925 --> 00:19:39.804
But I'm okay.
I think I just had a nightmare.

00:19:47.228 --> 00:19:49.188
<i>This is weird.</i>

00:19:50.523 --> 00:19:56.821
<i>What she just said neither saved me</i>
<i>nor blamed me.</i>

00:19:57.905 --> 00:20:01.617
<i>I just can't keep my eyes off of her.</i>

00:20:04.787 --> 00:20:06.163
Thank you for helping me out.

00:20:06.789 --> 00:20:09.458
They haven't been looking good these days.

00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:12.586
There will be more sunlight,
so they will get better.

00:20:13.421 --> 00:20:17.049
Let me treat you something.
What's your favorite food?

00:20:19.635 --> 00:20:21.512
<i>I don't need anything.</i>

00:20:22.722 --> 00:20:27.226
<i>I just want to talk to you more.</i>

00:20:28.602 --> 00:20:31.856
Well, I...

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:37.737
<i>But she'll be surprised</i>
<i>if a wolf like me said so.</i>

00:20:38.279 --> 00:20:39.697
Give me a second.

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.407
<i>Will I scare her?</i>

00:20:44.034 --> 00:20:46.787
<i>If I were a rabbit...</i>

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:48.789
I see.

00:20:49.707 --> 00:20:50.958
You're just like the others.

00:20:51.041 --> 00:20:54.962
<i>Even so, I wouldn't be able to tell her...</i>

00:20:55.045 --> 00:20:58.799
I don't really get turned on
after taking care of plants, though.

00:20:58.883 --> 00:21:03.679
<i>"I want to talk to you more"?</i>
<i>I didn't even really talk.</i>

00:21:03.763 --> 00:21:06.974
It's my first time with a carnivore.

00:21:07.057 --> 00:21:10.811
<i>I hate myself, like always.</i>

00:21:10.895 --> 00:21:12.396
Is this your first herbivore?

00:21:20.279 --> 00:21:21.739
It's okay.

00:21:21.822 --> 00:21:25.868
Even if you treat me roughly,
I will enjoy myself.

00:21:30.915 --> 00:21:35.836
