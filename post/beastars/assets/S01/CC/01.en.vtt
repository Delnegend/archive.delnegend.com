WEBVTT

00:00:31.365 --> 00:00:34.117
<i>That day, I encountered</i>

00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:38.121
<i>a small rabbit and my own instincts.</i>

00:01:22.541 --> 00:01:26.545
Are you seriously going to eat
your classmate?

00:01:26.628 --> 00:01:29.381
We took classes together.

00:02:00.203 --> 00:02:05.167
Are we nothing but food to you carnivores?

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.468
LECTURE OVERVIEW
MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN SPECIES

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:35.030
You carnivores are all monsters!

00:02:47.918 --> 00:02:49.002
Extra!

00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:51.880
Extra here!

00:02:54.758 --> 00:02:56.301
Devoured?

00:02:56.385 --> 00:02:59.763
Did you hear?
It was Tem from the drama club.

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:01.098
No way.

00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:03.350
Els, he was in your club.

00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:06.686
We rehearsed together yesterday.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.398
The killer has to be
one of the carnivorous students.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.111
We don't know if it was a student yet.

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:16.655
But it definitely was a carnivore.

00:03:16.738 --> 00:03:19.157
I'm sorry to say this,
but it's pretty ironic

00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:22.077
that a drama student became the prey.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.538
The drama club was known
for its friendship

00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:26.581
between carnivores and herbivores.

00:03:26.665 --> 00:03:28.708
Be careful, Els.

00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:32.087
Isn't there a gray wolf in the club?

00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:37.509
Gosh, I lost my appetite.

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:39.177
Me, too.

00:03:40.512 --> 00:03:43.890
HERBIVORES
TODAY'S SPECIAL: SEAFOOD VEGGIE PLATE

00:04:00.574 --> 00:04:02.033
This is bad.

00:04:02.117 --> 00:04:05.495
Yeah. We have our show in two weeks.

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.498
We need to find a replacement for Tem.

00:04:08.582 --> 00:04:09.624
Yeah.

00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:14.921
But should we really be performing
when one of our members just died?

00:04:22.137 --> 00:04:24.347
I still can't believe it.

00:04:25.015 --> 00:04:25.849
Yeah.

00:04:26.725 --> 00:04:28.602
Where are Rouis and the seniors?

00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:30.312
They're having a club meeting.

00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:34.107
What's wrong, Els?

00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:36.693
Well...

00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:47.496
Is everyone here?

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:49.080
Gather around.

00:04:49.164 --> 00:04:51.166
SHOW NOT YOUR FANGS BUT YOUR HEART

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:53.126
I'm sure you already know,

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.087
but a horrible incident happened
at school this morning.

00:04:57.172 --> 00:04:58.882
Tem, the actor...

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.472
President!

00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:08.892
This is the only place
Tem was in contact with the carnivores.

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:10.101
And?

00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:11.853
Are you suspecting us?

00:05:11.937 --> 00:05:14.981
Maybe someone got jealous of him
for getting a good role.

00:05:15.065 --> 00:05:17.317
How dare you say that!

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.569
Herbivores are always like this.

00:05:19.653 --> 00:05:20.946
Wanna start a fight?

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:23.240
-I can't open these walnuts.
-If a carnivore hurts a herbivore...

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:24.908
-Where's Legoshi?
-...they would be expelled.

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:25.867
-Hey.
-Ridiculous!

00:05:25.951 --> 00:05:28.662
-Legoshi isn't a nutcracker.
-You're not even worth using my fangs.

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:30.163
-Stop it!
-You're right.

00:05:30.247 --> 00:05:32.207
-You're both stripes.
-Legoshi isn't here.

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:34.709
Where has he gone?

00:05:38.964 --> 00:05:40.715
<i>I'm scared.</i>

00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:42.509
<i>Those were eyes looking at prey.</i>

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:46.721
That wolf's telling me that I'm next.

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:48.431
You're overthinking.

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:52.018
Legoshi's always been a bit weird.

00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:55.063
You can come see me anytime.

00:05:55.146 --> 00:05:57.941
We prosimians are always fun and cheerful.

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:00.318
Thank you.

00:06:00.402 --> 00:06:01.820
Good night.

00:06:01.903 --> 00:06:02.904
Good night.

00:06:29.014 --> 00:06:29.973
Stay away.

00:06:39.566 --> 00:06:43.653
You pretend to be our friend,
but once you're hungry, we're your food?

00:06:45.322 --> 00:06:46.781
Don't look down on us!

00:06:46.865 --> 00:06:50.702
Tem and I are much more...

00:06:54.331 --> 00:06:55.206
<i>Here.</i>

00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:02.047
It's a love letter. For you.

00:07:03.715 --> 00:07:07.385
I waited so we could be alone.

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:16.645
TO ELS, FROM TEM

00:07:16.728 --> 00:07:18.355
You wanted to give me this?

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:19.397
Yeah.

00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:23.485
I knew Tem couldn't give it to you.

00:07:25.487 --> 00:07:26.321
Sorry.

00:07:26.947 --> 00:07:29.407
Maybe I shouldn't have done this.

00:07:29.491 --> 00:07:31.534
It's okay. Thank you.

00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:36.498
Well, see you tomorrow.

00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:48.426
Hey.

00:07:50.971 --> 00:07:54.474
I said something really mean earlier.

00:07:55.433 --> 00:07:57.894
You're a kind wolf.

00:07:58.895 --> 00:08:00.230
I'll take it back tomorrow.

00:08:01.106 --> 00:08:02.774
So forgive me, please?

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:05.902
You don't need to take it back.

00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:09.030
Why?

00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:12.951
If everyone finds out about his first love
after he died,

00:08:13.034 --> 00:08:14.619
I'd feel bad for Tem.

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:16.955
But still...

00:08:17.038 --> 00:08:20.125
If I don't do anything, I'll feel guilty.

00:08:21.084 --> 00:08:23.628
Don't worry, it's nothing new.

00:08:24.462 --> 00:08:28.758
I'm used to being feared and loathed.

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:43.106
<i>How awkward.</i>

00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:06.379
You put it back again.

00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:10.258
It's not the right time yet.

00:09:10.341 --> 00:09:12.135
Don't worry.

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:14.888
I'll find the perfect time to do this,

00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:15.972
<i>to tell her how I feel.</i>

00:09:18.058 --> 00:09:20.935
<i>Tem. I told her your feelings.</i>

00:09:21.686 --> 00:09:23.313
It's Rouis!

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:24.981
The lead in <i>Adler?</i>

00:09:25.065 --> 00:09:27.400
He's handsome both on and off stage.

00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:50.632
<i>His movements, his voice, his gaze.</i>

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:55.470
<i>Rouis must be aware of</i>
<i>what he's projecting every minute.</i>

00:09:56.304 --> 00:09:58.932
<i>He's just a year older,</i>

00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:02.560
<i>but he's the star of our club</i>
<i>and holds power at school.</i>

00:10:03.853 --> 00:10:05.105
What are you staring at?

00:10:06.648 --> 00:10:09.317
Is being rude a wolf's habit?

00:10:11.319 --> 00:10:13.530
You're the pup from the art department.

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:15.490
Perfect timing. I have a favor to ask.

00:10:15.573 --> 00:10:16.574
Follow me.

00:10:17.367 --> 00:10:18.201
Okay.

00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:43.226
So sorry, are you all right?
The wind was too strong.

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:44.894
You're fine, right?

00:10:44.978 --> 00:10:48.731
I mean, guys always come to help you out.

00:10:54.154 --> 00:10:55.905
The flowers were blooming beautifully...

00:10:59.951 --> 00:11:02.912
STUDENT ID - NAME: LEGOSHI
CLASSIFICATION: CANIS LUPUS

00:11:10.962 --> 00:11:12.172
I'm fine.

00:11:12.255 --> 00:11:15.800
I'm not at all bothered
by whatever you do.

00:11:23.933 --> 00:11:26.519
How about finding a new room?

00:11:30.315 --> 00:11:31.691
How ridiculous.

00:11:38.823 --> 00:11:41.910
Rabbit mattresses are so small.

00:11:41.993 --> 00:11:42.827
What?

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:45.455
I'll help you carry it.

00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:47.248
You shouldn't. It's Haru.

00:11:49.334 --> 00:11:51.669
Thank you. I can do it myself.

00:11:56.966 --> 00:12:01.387
Three down... a marginalized animal?

00:12:02.597 --> 00:12:04.515
One, two, three...

00:12:05.642 --> 00:12:06.601
Ten letters.

00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:14.984
Hey, Sally. You could've stopped them
if you were here.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:17.820
She's pretty pissed at you.

00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:20.448
You should stay quiet for a while.

00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:22.075
Thanks for your advice.

00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:24.494
Wanna grab dinner?

00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:27.830
With you? No thanks.

00:12:27.914 --> 00:12:28.831
Fine.

00:12:30.124 --> 00:12:33.419
Ten letters, a marginalized animal?

00:12:34.128 --> 00:12:35.713
Is it a carnivore?

00:12:36.422 --> 00:12:37.632
Black sheep.

00:12:38.132 --> 00:12:41.344
Black sheep... that's it!

00:12:41.427 --> 00:12:42.929
You're so smart.

00:12:43.721 --> 00:12:45.264
Am I?

00:12:49.268 --> 00:12:50.520
<i>Can I take a seat?</i>

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:53.523
<i>Sorry, I'm waiting for my friend.</i>

00:12:54.565 --> 00:12:55.900
<i>Is that seat open?</i>

00:13:00.697 --> 00:13:03.658
The food's good even behind the cafeteria.

00:13:09.539 --> 00:13:11.249
Impressive.

00:13:11.332 --> 00:13:15.628
You're being ignored by the whole school,
but you're still emotionally strong.

00:13:15.712 --> 00:13:17.547
Be careful, though.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:20.299
We just had that incident.

00:13:20.383 --> 00:13:23.511
It's dangerous for a rabbit like you
to be alone.

00:13:24.846 --> 00:13:26.889
I lost my appetite.

00:13:31.352 --> 00:13:36.691
Why don't you reconcile with your ex
instead of badmouthing me around school?

00:13:36.774 --> 00:13:39.652
What? Who do you think you are?

00:13:39.736 --> 00:13:40.611
Whose fault--

00:13:40.695 --> 00:13:43.197
He's the one who suddenly kissed me.

00:13:43.281 --> 00:13:46.743
Besides, I'm not interested in a guy

00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:49.245
who'd get so excited from a little peck.

00:13:49.328 --> 00:13:50.163
Out of the way.

00:13:57.628 --> 00:13:59.338
Listen up.

00:13:59.422 --> 00:14:04.802
My ex and I are both endangered
Harlequin rabbits.

00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:07.221
We're out of your league.

00:14:07.305 --> 00:14:10.016
You, an ordinary dwarf rabbit,

00:14:10.099 --> 00:14:12.018
ruined a well-bred couple.

00:14:12.602 --> 00:14:18.149
I'll tell the whole school
you're flirting with other males.

00:14:18.232 --> 00:14:19.067
Let's go.

00:14:31.996 --> 00:14:33.164
Rouis.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.210
Fit his outfit before
tomorrow's rehearsal.

00:14:37.293 --> 00:14:38.127
What?

00:14:38.628 --> 00:14:40.546
Zoe is Tem's replacement.

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:42.965
We made the decision
in yesterday's meeting.

00:14:43.925 --> 00:14:45.051
Right?

00:14:45.134 --> 00:14:45.968
Yes.

00:14:47.136 --> 00:14:51.265
"How ironic to see you here,
Oddie the Water Spirit."

00:14:51.974 --> 00:14:52.934
What?

00:14:53.476 --> 00:14:56.187
We're rehearsing. What's Oddie's line?

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:59.482
I'm sorry. I haven't memorized it yet...

00:15:02.402 --> 00:15:04.737
Come on. Open your mouth.

00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:07.156
Rouis.

00:15:08.825 --> 00:15:11.786
Hey. Did you eat up the script?

00:15:13.454 --> 00:15:17.417
The only skill you goats have
is to eat paper, isn't it?

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:20.420
I'd rather you use that skill
somewhere else.

00:15:21.045 --> 00:15:22.964
I promise to have the lines by tomorrow.

00:15:23.798 --> 00:15:27.385
Rouis. Why is Zoe replacing Tem?

00:15:27.468 --> 00:15:29.512
Tem and I were the last two
at the audition--

00:15:29.595 --> 00:15:31.305
-Knock first.
-Yes.

00:15:33.683 --> 00:15:36.227
Go outside and learn the lines.

00:15:37.395 --> 00:15:38.229
Yes.

00:15:42.984 --> 00:15:47.113
Hey. Why are you here?
You're a nobody from the art department.

00:15:47.196 --> 00:15:50.199
Yeah. I'll leave, too, then.

00:15:50.283 --> 00:15:51.868
No, you can stay here.

00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:55.538
Kai, make sure you get along with Legoshi.

00:15:56.122 --> 00:15:58.374
You'll be working together
in the art department.

00:15:58.458 --> 00:15:59.417
What?

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:03.421
You'll no longer serve as an actor.

00:16:04.714 --> 00:16:07.842
From now on, you'll be
in the art department

00:16:07.925 --> 00:16:10.136
and support us from backstage.

00:16:12.138 --> 00:16:12.972
Hey!

00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:16.350
Are you done stretching?

00:16:17.518 --> 00:16:20.229
The spring performance act 2 footwork.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.774
The winter safari tournament's
final dance.

00:16:24.775 --> 00:16:29.197
You know better than anyone else
that I didn't just mumble a spell.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.323
Right, Kai?

00:16:31.032 --> 00:16:36.245
You've been an actor for two years,
and what have you accomplished?

00:16:36.329 --> 00:16:39.207
Those two mistakes you made on stage.

00:16:41.542 --> 00:16:43.461
Actually, I'm the one who'd like to ask.

00:16:44.086 --> 00:16:46.422
Why did you think you could replace Tem?

00:16:48.549 --> 00:16:50.801
Actor's safety comes first.

00:16:51.677 --> 00:16:53.679
That's the crew's important job.

00:16:55.223 --> 00:16:57.892
He's the lead, Kai.

00:16:57.975 --> 00:17:00.728
Who the hell do you think you are?

00:17:06.943 --> 00:17:08.694
This is just foolish.

00:17:08.778 --> 00:17:09.946
I'll let you off the hook.

00:17:13.115 --> 00:17:14.450
Must be nice being rich.

00:17:14.534 --> 00:17:16.536
You'll be protected
for the rest of your life.

00:17:17.745 --> 00:17:19.288
What are you staring at?

00:17:24.502 --> 00:17:27.588
Showing your fangs to avoid a fight?

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:29.298
I'm surprised.

00:17:30.091 --> 00:17:34.887
You always act like a herbivore,
but you had some ferocity within you.

00:17:34.971 --> 00:17:36.180
Excuse me.

00:17:42.645 --> 00:17:46.399
Still, you seem like you have
a good understanding.

00:17:47.191 --> 00:17:48.276
Come.

00:17:48.359 --> 00:17:51.571
We're sneaking into the auditorium tonight
to give Zoe a rehearsal.

00:17:51.654 --> 00:17:53.739
But if the school finds out...

00:17:53.823 --> 00:17:55.741
That's why I need you to keep watch.

00:17:56.993 --> 00:18:01.706
You're not going to refuse
and act like a hero, are you?

00:18:03.165 --> 00:18:05.042
That's too bad.

00:18:05.126 --> 00:18:08.504
If I promised you to give you my leg,

00:18:08.588 --> 00:18:11.924
you'd drool and accept my proposal,
wouldn't you?

00:18:14.385 --> 00:18:15.720
You're a wolf.

00:18:15.803 --> 00:18:18.931
Act like one and give yourself
some prestige.

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:26.397
It's pretty dry now.

00:18:39.535 --> 00:18:42.079
<i>Males look at this face and think,</i>

00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:44.790
<i>"I want to protect her,"</i>

00:18:44.874 --> 00:18:47.209
<i>or "I need to be by her side,"</i>

00:18:47.293 --> 00:18:49.003
<i>and approach me.</i>

00:18:50.254 --> 00:18:54.925
<i>But when they find out that's an illusion,</i>
<i>they mess around for a while and leave.</i>

00:18:57.637 --> 00:19:01.307
<i>I've been a prey my entire life.</i>

00:19:02.767 --> 00:19:05.728
<i>Not that it matters, really.</i>

00:19:13.235 --> 00:19:17.865
<i>If this gets out,</i>
<i>the drama club is doomed.</i>

00:19:17.948 --> 00:19:21.077
<i>And I'll be... suspended?</i>

00:19:21.869 --> 00:19:23.204
<i>Hurry up.</i>

00:19:23.287 --> 00:19:26.957
<i>The teachers are on patrol more frequently</i>
<i>since that incident.</i>

00:19:35.383 --> 00:19:38.135
BACK ENTRANCE

00:19:41.847 --> 00:19:44.725
What are you doing here, little pal?

00:19:45.893 --> 00:19:47.603
<i>I guess I should be asked that question.</i>

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.630
<i>A herbivore.</i>

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.739
<i>That's right.</i>

00:20:40.823 --> 00:20:43.159
<i>To conquer this world...</i>

00:20:44.368 --> 00:20:48.038
<i>you need to live by instincts.</i>

00:20:49.123 --> 00:20:51.625
<i>I can't even get in the ring.</i>

00:20:57.423 --> 00:21:00.926
<i>You can just have me if you want.</i>

00:21:03.929 --> 00:21:06.182
<i>But I want you to know</i>

00:21:07.141 --> 00:21:11.103
<i>that even a pathetic animal like me</i>
<i>had a reason to run away</i>

00:21:11.729 --> 00:21:14.482
<i>or cry out in fear.</i>

00:21:18.486 --> 00:21:21.447
<i>Would you understand?</i>

00:21:30.956 --> 00:21:35.878
THE MOON AND THE BEAST
