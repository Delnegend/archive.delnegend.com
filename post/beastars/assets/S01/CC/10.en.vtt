00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.072
<i>Haru...</i>

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.116
<i>Haru...</i>

00:01:57.492 --> 00:01:59.911
<i>I followed your scent</i>
<i>and managed to get here,</i>

00:02:00.621 --> 00:02:04.541
<i>but it is impossible to follow</i>
<i>your scent here anymore.</i>

00:02:05.751 --> 00:02:09.963
<i>The only clue I have is "Shishi-Gumi."</i>

00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:15.385
Hey, dude, what's the matter with you?
Want some goat arms?

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:17.929
Excuse me. Do you know anything
about Shishi-Gumi?

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:20.098
Shi...

00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:23.268
No, you didn't tell me anything.

00:02:29.608 --> 00:02:31.360
Excuse me, is Shishi-Gumi...

00:02:33.278 --> 00:02:36.031
<i>Once they hear me say "Shishi-Gumi,"</i>

00:02:36.114 --> 00:02:38.617
<i>they just run away or look away from me.</i>

00:02:40.077 --> 00:02:41.286
<i>What should I do?</i>

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:45.791
Hey, watch where you're going.

00:02:45.874 --> 00:02:47.501
Oh, I'm sorry...

00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:50.170
Do you know where Shishi-Gumi is?

00:02:51.588 --> 00:02:53.423
-Shishi-Gumi?
-Yes.

00:02:56.134 --> 00:02:57.094
This way.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.104
Are they somewhere around here?

00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:13.568
You will just die in vain
if you go to Shishi-Gumi.

00:03:13.652 --> 00:03:16.696
Why don't you let us
skin your fur off instead?

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.073
Let's see...

00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:20.367
Is this all you have?

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.036
My friend was abducted by Shishi-Gumi.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.163
Your wallet is totally empty.

00:03:25.247 --> 00:03:27.916
We can't sell your fur
if they sank you in the pond.

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:28.834
The pond?

00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:31.711
Young wolf fur fetches a high price--

00:03:35.424 --> 00:03:37.384
Thanks for taking care of my patient.

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:39.219
Damn. Let's get out of here.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:42.764
Panda.

00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:47.394
My name is Gohin, not Panda.

00:03:47.978 --> 00:03:52.566
Even carnivores are preyed around here.
Keep that in mind.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.861
Well, I want to go
to the Shishi-Gumi's hideout.

00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:58.405
Hey, keep your voice down.

00:03:59.823 --> 00:04:00.782
Listen,

00:04:00.866 --> 00:04:05.120
Shishi-Gumi is a criminal organization
consisting of 35 lions.

00:04:05.871 --> 00:04:08.623
<i>A dangerous group that devours herbivores</i>
<i>as a business.</i>

00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:11.293
<i>Even I don't want to deal with them. </i>

00:04:11.376 --> 00:04:13.962
What can a single wolf do...

00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:15.714
All right. I understand.

00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:16.923
SHISHI-GUMI

00:04:17.007 --> 00:04:18.467
Where is the pond, anyway?

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.552
Were you even listening to me?

00:04:20.635 --> 00:04:23.638
I have no idea what this is for,
but you'll be killed.

00:04:23.722 --> 00:04:27.225
Well, yeah, that seems possible
from what you've just told me.

00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:35.192
But the rabbit girl I was talking about
has been abducted by them.

00:04:35.901 --> 00:04:39.237
Sorry to hear that,
but there's nothing you can do about it.

00:04:39.321 --> 00:04:41.698
She must have already been devoured.

00:04:41.782 --> 00:04:45.660
I have to save her, no matter what.

00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:51.583
I have to make up for what I've done
to her as a carnivore.

00:04:53.752 --> 00:04:57.756
That I tried to eat her
when I met her for the first time,

00:04:57.839 --> 00:05:02.803
and I, such a jerk wolf,

00:05:02.886 --> 00:05:05.555
am in love with her.

00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:10.435
If I could still survive
after I made up for the sin,

00:05:10.519 --> 00:05:12.312
I want to tell her my feelings.

00:05:13.355 --> 00:05:14.815
Well, maybe I can't.

00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:17.943
This is ridiculous.

00:05:18.777 --> 00:05:22.113
It's okay if you won't tell me
where the pond is.

00:05:22.197 --> 00:05:23.114
Thank you.

00:05:23.198 --> 00:05:24.699
Hey. Wait.

00:05:27.744 --> 00:05:29.746
That stupid brat...

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.581
Who cares.

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.671
It's raining so hard.

00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:39.339
We can't go back to school.

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:42.717
I wonder where Legoshi is.

00:05:42.801 --> 00:05:45.095
-He didn't take his stuff with him.
-Yeah.

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:47.806
Look at Rouis.

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:49.474
Hey, he may hear you.

00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:52.060
Rouis.

00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:54.938
What happened between you and Legoshi?

00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:55.897
Why?

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.193
If you think I'm not aware of anything,
you are very wrong.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.073
I was freaked out when I found out
that he loves her, though.

00:06:07.158 --> 00:06:09.452
Where has he gone?

00:06:13.832 --> 00:06:17.711
I don't think we'll see him again.

00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:21.131
I'm seriously asking--

00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:22.173
I am serious, too.

00:06:23.925 --> 00:06:26.303
Does it have something to do
with the rabbit?

00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:29.139
Sorry, Juno...

00:06:29.723 --> 00:06:32.726
I couldn't prevent anything.

00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:37.188
<i>Tonight, he might get killed.</i>

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:43.486
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>I can get through the front gate.</i>

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:44.779
<i>What should I do?</i>

00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:50.577
It's unusual to see a wolf
visiting here alone.

00:06:51.703 --> 00:06:54.456
I thought wolves could only act in a pack.

00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:57.167
Trespassing is not allowed,

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.836
whether it's for vengeance
or for selling something.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.714
Please... let me explain.

00:07:02.797 --> 00:07:05.258
-I have a reason to be here--
-No, no, no.

00:07:05.342 --> 00:07:07.969
Don't deprive me
of such a great opportunity.

00:07:08.553 --> 00:07:10.764
We, the Felidae,

00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:14.309
are absolutely sick of you, Canidae.

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:17.562
Even though you guys are as ferocious
as we are,

00:07:17.646 --> 00:07:20.690
your friendliness with your tails wagging
gets on our nerves.

00:07:21.316 --> 00:07:24.694
What a great reward for me
to be able to shoot their symbol,

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:27.447
a gray wolf.
That's something I never expected.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.117
Do you have any last words?

00:07:33.078 --> 00:07:34.579
<i>It's coming in.</i>

00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:36.539
<i>I can see it.</i>

00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:42.253
<i>It can't be... No, I'm definitely sure...</i>

00:07:43.964 --> 00:07:46.091
<i>He's touched Haru.</i>

00:07:47.926 --> 00:07:51.304
What have you done to her?

00:07:51.972 --> 00:07:54.516
I see, so you're here to save that rabbit.

00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:57.560
She's on the top floor of the building.

00:07:57.644 --> 00:07:59.688
But it's kinda too late.

00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:02.357
If you want to see her,
you must make him vomit.

00:08:03.233 --> 00:08:08.655
You can still see her
if she hasn't been digested yet.

00:08:23.253 --> 00:08:25.964
STUDENT ID - NAME: ELS
CLASSIFICATION: ALPACA

00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:49.446
You, old man. Tell me the truth.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.532
I don't smell blood from you.

00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:55.577
Her blood. So, she should still be alive.

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.287
No. I didn't...

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:58.788
<i>I know.</i>

00:08:58.872 --> 00:09:01.458
<i>I know the smell of her blood.</i>

00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:03.501
<i>Haru is mine.</i>

00:09:03.585 --> 00:09:06.087
<i>Haru is my prey...</i>

00:09:07.464 --> 00:09:08.590
<i>What?</i>

00:09:11.634 --> 00:09:12.927
<i>My prey?</i>

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:17.599
Don't mess with me.

00:09:21.603 --> 00:09:23.772
Bastard, I'll kill you.

00:09:31.905 --> 00:09:35.408
Well, it's probably a perfect day
for hunting those cats today.

00:09:35.909 --> 00:09:36.993
Mr. Gohin...

00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:40.413
Why didn't you bite him?

00:09:40.497 --> 00:09:45.627
The only way to defeat
those Felidae soldiers for a wolf like you

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:48.129
is to bite them

00:09:48.213 --> 00:09:49.881
using your jaw.

00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:52.092
I shouldn't...

00:09:52.175 --> 00:09:56.012
bite anyone because I just had...

00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:58.306
You're so helpless.

00:09:58.973 --> 00:10:01.935
Who would risk his own life
just to make a love confession?

00:10:02.519 --> 00:10:05.939
Listen, don't hesitate to bite next time.

00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:07.148
Bite in the neck.

00:10:12.487 --> 00:10:16.449
Even though your love is originated
from your hunting instinct,

00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:19.285
you believe your act can change
the outcome, right?

00:10:20.078 --> 00:10:20.912
Here.

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:24.207
Don't run away.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.835
Righteous acts are worth it,

00:10:26.918 --> 00:10:28.628
but it's really rough.

00:10:31.714 --> 00:10:35.343
I know. I have no choice.

00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:42.142
Or I would be like just one of these guys.

00:10:42.725 --> 00:10:43.768
That's right.

00:10:44.602 --> 00:10:47.105
Tame the beast inside you, Legoshi.

00:10:48.148 --> 00:10:50.900
That's what a mature man is supposed to do
in this world.

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:02.328
Take this.

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:09.335
SHISHI

00:11:13.631 --> 00:11:15.550
Who the hell are you?

00:11:39.115 --> 00:11:40.033
You bastard.

00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:45.246
Such a jerk, you know?

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:58.051
Mr. Gohin.

00:11:58.134 --> 00:12:00.136
Legoshi, hurry, go upstairs.

00:12:00.219 --> 00:12:01.054
You, old man.

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:04.140
One more.

00:12:06.142 --> 00:12:08.686
<i>He's aiming at my nose.</i>

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:13.107
Are you surprised that I know
the bear's muzzle is full of nerves?

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.527
Legoshi...

00:12:17.236 --> 00:12:18.863
Get out of my way, bastard.

00:12:20.823 --> 00:12:23.284
He's just a kid.
Is he a friend of that rabbit?

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:26.871
I can make you feel comfortable soon.

00:12:26.955 --> 00:12:30.541
I can kill you with my hands
that abducted the rabbit.

00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:31.459
What?

00:12:35.588 --> 00:12:37.632
<i>The scent is still fresh.</i>

00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:41.511
<i>Haru... </i>

00:12:42.428 --> 00:12:44.055
<i>I know you're still alive.</i>

00:12:44.138 --> 00:12:46.599
Damn, you're so creepy. Take this.

00:12:46.683 --> 00:12:48.601
<i>I miss you.</i>

00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:50.561
Hey. Are you doped--

00:12:52.522 --> 00:12:55.608
<i>The scent stimulates</i>
<i>all the muscles of my body</i>

00:12:55.692 --> 00:12:57.360
<i>and heats my body up</i>

00:12:58.361 --> 00:13:00.154
<i>because I feel you in the scent.</i>

00:13:01.572 --> 00:13:06.077
<i>My simple ego, which makes me stronger</i>
<i>than instinct.</i>

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:08.871
<i>I'm coming to see you.</i>

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:12.834
Legoshi, you can leave him to me.
Go upstairs now.

00:13:12.917 --> 00:13:13.751
But...

00:13:14.335 --> 00:13:17.463
I can beat these small fry up
all by myself.

00:13:17.547 --> 00:13:18.423
Don't die.

00:13:20.675 --> 00:13:23.052
I won't. You, too, Mr. Gohin.

00:13:25.555 --> 00:13:26.806
<i>Such a smart-ass.</i>

00:13:40.486 --> 00:13:42.155
TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN

00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:45.366
<i>Wait. Do I need to begin with</i>
<i>"To whom it may concern"?</i>

00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:47.994
<i>What does that even mean?</i>

00:13:48.953 --> 00:13:51.831
<i>Oh, it's just a kind of greeting, huh?</i>

00:13:52.331 --> 00:13:53.583
<i>Well, forget it.</i>

00:13:53.666 --> 00:13:55.835
<i>I don't care who's going to read it.</i>

00:13:56.711 --> 00:14:01.340
<i>A farewell note beginning with a greeting</i>
<i>is just too gloomy.</i>

00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:03.384
<i>This is more like...</i>

00:14:03.468 --> 00:14:06.429
<i>a review of my life</i>
<i>instead of a farewell note.</i>

00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:09.515
<i>It's like I'm intentionally having</i>
<i>a flashback.</i>

00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:12.685
I AM DYING WITHIN MINUTES

00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:14.187
<i>My life is...</i>

00:14:14.937 --> 00:14:18.024
<i>ending so miserably</i>
<i>that it's almost funny.</i>

00:14:18.941 --> 00:14:21.444
<i>I was abducted by a weird group.</i>

00:14:22.111 --> 00:14:25.323
<i>And I'm being inspected</i>
<i>to see my quality as meat.</i>

00:14:26.491 --> 00:14:28.576
<i>It's too late to give an excuse,</i>

00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:32.538
<i>but as a female and a small animal,</i>

00:14:33.873 --> 00:14:36.000
<i>I was just desperate to live my life.</i>

00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:38.169
<i>I really was.</i>

00:14:39.837 --> 00:14:42.048
<i>But the way I lived my life</i>

00:14:42.131 --> 00:14:45.468
<i>probably led to this ending.</i>

00:14:47.428 --> 00:14:51.766
<i>Since I was born as a dwarf rabbit,</i>

00:14:51.849 --> 00:14:54.143
<i>how could I expect a happy life?</i>

00:14:58.564 --> 00:15:02.568
<i>I was born</i>
<i>in a typical dwarf rabbit's family</i>

00:15:02.652 --> 00:15:06.030
<i>and raised with my parents' love,</i>
<i>just like other animals.</i>

00:15:06.989 --> 00:15:10.660
<i>Because I was the tiniest</i>
<i>among my siblings,</i>

00:15:10.743 --> 00:15:12.662
<i>my parents always told me...</i>

00:15:13.704 --> 00:15:15.456
<i>Always be cautious.</i>

00:15:15.998 --> 00:15:19.961
<i>Dwarf rabbits are</i>
<i>one of the weakest herbivores.</i>

00:15:20.044 --> 00:15:21.963
<i>So, you have to be careful.</i>

00:15:22.046 --> 00:15:23.172
<i>Why?</i>

00:15:23.256 --> 00:15:25.842
<i>Because you can die easily.</i>

00:15:26.467 --> 00:15:29.804
<i>It didn't go down well with me</i>
<i>when I was little,</i>

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:33.891
<i>but I began to understand what that meant</i>
<i>when I turned ten years old.</i>

00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:37.437
<i>Here, let me help you.</i>

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.729
<i>Thank you.</i>

00:15:38.813 --> 00:15:40.731
<i>No matter how old I was,</i>

00:15:40.815 --> 00:15:44.569
<i>all other animals treated me like a baby.</i>

00:15:44.652 --> 00:15:45.987
<i>Why are you smiling?</i>

00:15:47.363 --> 00:15:49.157
<i>Nothing. Thanks.</i>

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:52.743
<i>Because I am small, fragile,</i>

00:15:53.369 --> 00:15:54.662
<i>miserable,</i>

00:15:55.913 --> 00:15:57.957
<i>and I can die easily.</i>

00:15:58.833 --> 00:16:03.463
<i>Everybody smiles at such a pitiful animal.</i>

00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:05.923
<i>-Oh, sorry.</i>
<i>-Aren't you hurt?</i>

00:16:07.258 --> 00:16:09.427
<i>You don't have to carry this, Haru.</i>

00:16:10.595 --> 00:16:13.890
<i>I grew up as others were giving me</i>
<i>"poor you" smiles.</i>

00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:16.267
<i>It was when I was in eighth grade.</i>

00:16:20.021 --> 00:16:21.022
I... I've been...

00:16:21.856 --> 00:16:24.650
in love with you.

00:16:25.651 --> 00:16:27.236
Would you be my girlfriend?

00:16:28.696 --> 00:16:29.906
<i>He's not smiling.</i>

00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:34.494
<i>I finally found it.</i>

00:16:35.828 --> 00:16:37.663
<i>The only moment</i>

00:16:37.747 --> 00:16:39.749
<i>I can be equal to other animals.</i>

00:16:41.626 --> 00:16:45.087
<i>In that moment, I was not "a poor rabbit."</i>

00:16:46.005 --> 00:16:49.342
<i>I was not treated as a weakling.</i>
<i>There's no lies in the bed.</i>

00:16:51.219 --> 00:16:54.680
<i>I wanted someone to see me as Haru,</i>

00:16:56.182 --> 00:17:00.061
<i>not as a fragile dwarf rabbit.</i>

00:17:01.103 --> 00:17:03.231
<i>Haru, are you all right?</i>

00:17:03.814 --> 00:17:04.774
<i>What?</i>

00:17:05.691 --> 00:17:08.319
<i>It may sound strange,</i>

00:17:08.402 --> 00:17:12.031
<i>but I felt like I was recognized</i>
<i>just the way I was for the first time.</i>

00:17:13.491 --> 00:17:16.494
<i>Even though I've lost friends,</i>
<i>and they looked down on me,</i>

00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:18.746
<i>strangely,</i>

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:22.708
<i>it felt a lot more comfortable</i>
<i>than being pitied.</i>

00:17:24.794 --> 00:17:26.087
<i>But it's over now.</i>

00:17:27.547 --> 00:17:28.714
<i>It's over.</i>

00:17:29.799 --> 00:17:32.051
<i>It's time to say goodbye</i>

00:17:32.134 --> 00:17:34.679
<i>to the trashy 18 years</i>
<i>of a dumb dwarf rabbit.</i>

00:17:36.722 --> 00:17:40.810
<i>I couldn't tell my true feelings</i>
<i>to the boy I really loved.</i>

00:17:42.186 --> 00:17:46.524
<i>I still don't know what I was born to do</i>
<i>and my value.</i>

00:17:48.359 --> 00:17:51.862
<i>All I have... are regrets.</i>

00:17:53.364 --> 00:17:54.365
<i>I...</i>

00:18:01.163 --> 00:18:02.081
<i>Why?</i>

00:18:04.083 --> 00:18:05.543
<i>Why is Legoshi here?</i>

00:18:07.753 --> 00:18:11.257
<i>He is not sociable,</i>
<i>and he doesn't talk much.</i>

00:18:12.425 --> 00:18:14.635
<i>I never know what he's thinking.</i>

00:18:16.304 --> 00:18:20.474
<i>But this gray wolf boy has always been</i>
<i>straightforward with me.</i>

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:25.688
<i>You have never pitied me</i>

00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:29.150
<i>or showed compassion to me,</i>

00:18:31.527 --> 00:18:34.113
<i>but you always saw me for who I am.</i>

00:18:36.741 --> 00:18:38.451
<i>You're so weird.</i>

00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:44.290
<i>That's right.</i>

00:18:45.791 --> 00:18:48.169
<i>I'm gonna get killed anyway,</i>

00:18:48.711 --> 00:18:51.172
<i>so I want you to be proud of me</i>
<i>in the end.</i>

00:18:52.048 --> 00:18:56.260
Humiliation and shame stir the blood,

00:18:56.344 --> 00:18:59.138
and it makes you taste even better.

00:19:01.307 --> 00:19:02.850
Hey, old man.

00:19:09.106 --> 00:19:12.360
Excuse me, but I was busy writing
a farewell note in my head

00:19:12.443 --> 00:19:14.236
while you were bragging about yourself.

00:19:15.738 --> 00:19:19.200
Humiliation stirs the blood
and makes me taste better?

00:19:19.283 --> 00:19:21.952
Unfortunately, I am very calm now.

00:19:25.414 --> 00:19:27.291
I heard you're a gourmet.

00:19:27.375 --> 00:19:30.670
Sorry that I ruined your dinner.

00:19:30.753 --> 00:19:34.799
You're gonna have to eat the tough meat
of a not-humiliated and unashamed female.

00:19:34.882 --> 00:19:35.966
Old man.

00:19:36.467 --> 00:19:39.345
Come on! Eat me now.
I'm just getting less flavorful.

00:19:39.428 --> 00:19:41.389
I'm ready!

00:19:49.814 --> 00:19:52.483
Looks like I've been too generous to you.

00:19:54.068 --> 00:19:56.946
I would not eat tough meat.

00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:59.448
I will humiliate you with all my heart.

00:19:59.532 --> 00:20:00.700
No.

00:20:04.578 --> 00:20:06.580
Let's start with your ears.

00:20:07.123 --> 00:20:09.333
No. Let go of me!

00:20:10.292 --> 00:20:13.546
<i>I'm so alone... even at the end.</i>

00:20:20.261 --> 00:20:22.096
<i>Nobody is gonna come to save me.</i>

00:20:23.347 --> 00:20:24.348
<i>Nobody...</i>

00:20:26.434 --> 00:20:28.728
<i>My life is over now.</i>

00:20:51.125 --> 00:20:52.168
Legoshi...

00:21:13.063 --> 00:21:13.898
Behind you.

00:21:15.649 --> 00:21:16.734
Sorry if it stinks.

00:21:16.817 --> 00:21:18.110
Put my shirt on.

00:21:19.487 --> 00:21:21.280
Why are you here?

00:21:23.824 --> 00:21:26.494
I have too many reasons to tell you now.

00:21:27.244 --> 00:21:28.662
Are you stupid?

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:35.961
A WOLF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING

00:23:04.008 --> 00:23:06.010
