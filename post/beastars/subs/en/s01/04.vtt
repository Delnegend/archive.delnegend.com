1
00:01:46.023 --> 00:01:50.944
GIVE IT YOUR ALL

2
00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:52.988
No!

3
00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:54.823
No, no, no, no!

4
00:01:54.906 --> 00:01:58.035
Who would like to see
such a dried-up skull?

5
00:01:58.118 --> 00:01:59.244
But...

6
00:01:59.328 --> 00:02:01.663
They're useless
without a close-up shot of Rouis!

7
00:02:01.747 --> 00:02:04.541
But he never takes his mask off.

8
00:02:04.625 --> 00:02:05.917
No more excuses!

9
00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:08.378
He must've shown his face
for the curtain call!

10
00:02:08.462 --> 00:02:09.671
He didn't reappear on the stage.

11
00:02:10.422 --> 00:02:14.760
He is the prince who loves to be cheered
and reelected as the Beastar!

12
00:02:14.843 --> 00:02:16.720
I don't believe that!

13
00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:34.780
Rouis!

14
00:02:34.863 --> 00:02:35.947
Rouis!

15
00:02:39.242 --> 00:02:40.160
I...

16
00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:42.996
No. Tell me...

17
00:02:43.664 --> 00:02:45.540
Did the audience notice?

18
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:48.877
Don't worry.

19
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.297
You passed out after the curtain dropped.

20
00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:54.341
The audience didn't notice that.

21
00:02:56.426 --> 00:02:57.594
Good...

22
00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:02.432
And it's 8:00 p.m. now.

23
00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:04.101
You're in the nurse's office.

24
00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:06.603
According to the nurse,
your left leg is broken.

25
00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:10.899
There's no way
that you can perform tomorrow.

26
00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:12.150
Bill, don't.

27
00:03:12.234 --> 00:03:13.568
But...

28
00:03:13.652 --> 00:03:16.863
Why should I wait any longer?
And especially, it's Rouis.

29
00:03:16.947 --> 00:03:18.365
Even so...

30
00:03:19.324 --> 00:03:20.826
The club president is right.

31
00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:22.411
You're so insensitive.

32
00:03:22.494 --> 00:03:26.289
Rouis somehow managed to make it
through the first day with his broken leg.

33
00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:29.334
Rouis, your performance was awesome!

34
00:03:29.418 --> 00:03:32.087
We were talking about tomorrow's stage.

35
00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:34.923
-The audience are all...
<i>-What's this?</i>

36
00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:39.177
<i>I'm pitied by everyone.</i>

37
00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:43.640
What?

38
00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:47.185
You're treating me with kid gloves?
It's just a broken leg.

39
00:03:48.103 --> 00:03:50.439
No... It's not like that...

40
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:52.941
Bill.

41
00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:56.361
Will you fill in for me?

42
00:03:57.696 --> 00:04:00.741
Tomorrow, you will be Adler.

43
00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:07.080
Can I really do that?

44
00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:10.083
"Yes, of course.

45
00:04:10.167 --> 00:04:13.044
I know you are
one of the hardest working actors.

46
00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:17.674
I especially liked that you didn't
hesitate to tell me about my injury.

47
00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:20.343
That's why I chose you."

48
00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:22.179
Like that.

49
00:04:23.472 --> 00:04:24.931
I'll be counting on you, Bill.

50
00:04:25.015 --> 00:04:27.142
Let's rehearse hard tonight.

51
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.770
Are you worried, President?

52
00:04:29.853 --> 00:04:32.397
I have completely memorized
the lines and actions.

53
00:04:32.481 --> 00:04:35.108
You should rather worry about...

54
00:04:40.197 --> 00:04:42.491
Why are you so reluctant to do that?

55
00:04:42.574 --> 00:04:44.826
Not everyone can get a chance like that.

56
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.369
That's not the point.

57
00:04:47.871 --> 00:04:51.166
Don't worry! You won't ruin the story

58
00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:54.377
even if you make a few little mistakes.
It's a minor role, after all.

59
00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:56.880
Then, why don't we omit the role?

60
00:04:57.506 --> 00:04:59.049
Legoshi.

61
00:05:01.051 --> 00:05:03.136
<i>I didn't expect this at all.</i>

62
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.096
<i>There are thee villains.</i>

63
00:05:05.806 --> 00:05:08.809
<i>One of them, Bill, will be Adler,</i>

64
00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:12.187
<i>and a villain role has become available.</i>

65
00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:17.192
All actors and dancers have been cast.

66
00:05:17.943 --> 00:05:21.363
Is there someone who looks like you
and doesn't have much to do...

67
00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:25.700
Legoshi!

68
00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:30.997
<i>It's been four years</i>
<i>since I joined the drama club.</i>

69
00:05:31.832 --> 00:05:34.501
<i>I will make a debut on stage.</i>

70
00:05:36.378 --> 00:05:39.089
You've been looking at the play
from up there as a gaffer,

71
00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:41.341
so you should remember some actions.

72
00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:43.385
Well, let's take it slow.

73
00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:47.222
<i>I am so uncoordinated.</i>

74
00:05:53.478 --> 00:05:57.232
Great! You don't disappoint me!

75
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.620
You're a gray wolf after all.

76
00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:13.873
I can't fight against
the red deer like this!

77
00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:16.084
You look happy.

78
00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:17.919
Of course!

79
00:06:18.003 --> 00:06:22.966
I never imagined that I'd be able to fight
with all my strength on stage.

80
00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:25.510
This is rehearsal, right?

81
00:06:25.594 --> 00:06:26.970
But those are not his lines.

82
00:06:30.181 --> 00:06:31.182
Legoshi,

83
00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:35.729
there's no such rule that we carnivores
should shun the limelight, correct?

84
00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:40.692
Tomorrow, I can finally show the audience

85
00:06:40.775 --> 00:06:46.031
how radiant the strong would look
when they are allowed to act on instinct.

86
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.368
It's between a wolf and a tiger.

87
00:06:50.452 --> 00:06:54.205
There won't be any false pretense
in our fight scene.

88
00:06:56.374 --> 00:06:57.208
But...

89
00:06:57.292 --> 00:07:00.462
It will be a great performance tomorrow.

90
00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:02.213
Letâ€™s do our best!

91
00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:23.485
<i>Are we the same carnivores?</i>

92
00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:27.113
<i>I don't understand him.</i>

93
00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:28.698
Legoshi!

94
00:07:29.574 --> 00:07:30.909
Hi, Els.

95
00:07:33.244 --> 00:07:34.496
Good work today.

96
00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:39.209
We had some troubles,

97
00:07:39.751 --> 00:07:42.420
but I believe
our stage will be great tomorrow.

98
00:07:42.504 --> 00:07:43.713
I believe so, too.

99
00:07:44.381 --> 00:07:46.132
Bill is a great guy.

100
00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:47.467
You, too, Legoshi.

101
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:53.014
He has that kind of personality,
so he is acting like it's nothing,

102
00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:55.934
but I know he's really nervous.

103
00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:57.310
Okay.

104
00:07:58.353 --> 00:07:59.396
Legoshi.

105
00:08:00.438 --> 00:08:04.985
Please give him support
in your own way tomorrow.

106
00:08:07.278 --> 00:08:08.196
Yeah.

107
00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:10.031
You're right.

108
00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:11.866
Wow!

109
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.952
-You do smile.
-What?

110
00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:15.870
I do, like everybody else.

111
00:08:16.746 --> 00:08:19.290
Let's make it a big success tomorrow.

112
00:08:19.374 --> 00:08:21.835
-Good night.
-Good night.

113
00:08:26.381 --> 00:08:30.385
<i>I've never thought about doing</i>
<i>something big like Bill has.</i>

114
00:08:32.053 --> 00:08:35.432
<i>But I can do my best in my own way.</i>

115
00:08:49.112 --> 00:08:50.989
Wanna wait for Master Rouis to come out?

116
00:08:51.072 --> 00:08:53.158
But he didn't come out yesterday, did he?

117
00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:55.118
He's never missed
a meet and greet with fans.

118
00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:56.995
Maybe just because he saw you waiting.

119
00:08:57.078 --> 00:08:59.122
Hey! I'm offended!

120
00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:01.041
Let's go. Seats will fill up quickly.

121
00:09:01.124 --> 00:09:03.835
<i>I can't wait to see Master Rouis!</i>

122
00:09:09.507 --> 00:09:11.843
Are you here to cheer me up?

123
00:09:11.926 --> 00:09:14.345
Or to give me some advice?

124
00:09:15.096 --> 00:09:16.264
Or...

125
00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:20.977
to screw me at the last minute?

126
00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:24.606
Got you!

127
00:09:27.609 --> 00:09:32.030
I didn't expect you come see me at all!

128
00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:33.573
Very funny.

129
00:09:34.282 --> 00:09:35.909
Please don't worry.

130
00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:40.121
I will not ruin your Adler,

131
00:09:40.205 --> 00:09:42.832
but I will leave my legacy
to the audience.

132
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.920
I will make them say,
"Striped Adler is not bad at all."

133
00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:50.173
ADLER

134
00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:52.092
The hall is full again today.

135
00:09:53.343 --> 00:09:56.471
His duty is to sway
a great variety of students

136
00:09:56.554 --> 00:09:58.223
and thousands of souls at once.

137
00:09:59.182 --> 00:10:02.852
That's the curse the role of Adler carries
on his back.

138
00:10:07.065 --> 00:10:10.068
If your mind gets crushed by the curse,

139
00:10:10.151 --> 00:10:12.487
it'd be worse than breaking a bone.

140
00:10:17.408 --> 00:10:19.369
Let me get the door for you.

141
00:10:21.079 --> 00:10:22.997
You're worldly and wise.

142
00:10:24.374 --> 00:10:27.961
You should share those qualities
with that wolf.

143
00:10:28.503 --> 00:10:32.215
Rouis, are you interested in him?

144
00:10:33.383 --> 00:10:35.093
He just annoys me.

145
00:10:35.844 --> 00:10:39.180
Because he is forcing himself
to stand on the side of the weak.

146
00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:43.268
As a deer, his attitude makes me sick.

147
00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.437
You two are complete opposites.

148
00:10:46.521 --> 00:10:47.438
Very funny.

149
00:10:48.148 --> 00:10:51.442
I'd never want to waste my life like him.

150
00:10:51.985 --> 00:10:55.655
I'm truly glad that I was born a tiger.

151
00:10:56.698 --> 00:11:00.743
Unlike him, I am gifted with qualities
of a large carnivore.

152
00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.334
"I found you."

153
00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:13.214
Are you ready? Did you sleep well?

154
00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:14.632
Well, yeah.

155
00:11:19.596 --> 00:11:20.513
What?

156
00:11:23.391 --> 00:11:26.895
I was just speaking poorly of you
with Rouis.

157
00:11:26.978 --> 00:11:28.146
So peaceful, huh?

158
00:11:36.112 --> 00:11:38.573
You are acting even more strange today.

159
00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:40.867
Bill.

160
00:11:41.743 --> 00:11:42.577
You...

161
00:11:44.245 --> 00:11:46.122
I gotta go to the bathroom!

162
00:11:47.206 --> 00:11:48.708
I'll be right back.

163
00:11:48.791 --> 00:11:51.210
Hey, we have only ten minutes!

164
00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:58.092
Gosh, you followed me to the bathroom.

165
00:11:58.176 --> 00:12:00.261
You must really be into me.

166
00:12:00.345 --> 00:12:01.304
What are you...

167
00:12:01.888 --> 00:12:03.514
hiding under the costume?

168
00:12:06.351 --> 00:12:10.021
So, I was not able to fool the keen
olfactory sense of a canine after all.

169
00:12:10.647 --> 00:12:14.150
Or what? You want a sip?

170
00:12:16.235 --> 00:12:18.363
-That's...
-Rabbit's blood.

171
00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:25.912
Of course, this is not
from one of the students.

172
00:12:25.995 --> 00:12:28.039
Just one of the older punks gave it to me.

173
00:12:28.122 --> 00:12:30.750
I've kept it, just in case.

174
00:12:31.417 --> 00:12:34.212
Well, today is the "case," you know?

175
00:12:39.258 --> 00:12:41.719
So, I really had no choice this time--

176
00:12:44.514 --> 00:12:46.391
Hey, listen to me now.

177
00:12:47.016 --> 00:12:49.686
It should be easier to live in the shadow
like you.

178
00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:52.605
But I want to live in the light!

179
00:12:52.689 --> 00:12:55.191
So, this is a reasonable doping!

180
00:12:55.692 --> 00:12:57.402
You always suck up to herbivores!

181
00:12:57.485 --> 00:13:01.656
You just keep dodging responsibilities.
You would never understand me!

182
00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:13.751
<i>He is right...</i>

183
00:13:14.836 --> 00:13:16.212
<i>I can't talk back to him.</i>

184
00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:20.842
<i>Why don't you take responsibility</i>
<i>for your strength?</i>

185
00:13:23.594 --> 00:13:25.346
<i>I don't want to run away anymore.</i>

186
00:13:28.933 --> 00:13:31.936
STUDENT ID - NAME: BILL
CLASSIFICATION: BENGAL TIGER

187
00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:40.862
Why is the fire chasing us?

188
00:13:41.362 --> 00:13:44.157
Because you were supposed to die
three days ago.

189
00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:52.290
Water, wind, fire, messengers of
all the elements want you dead.

190
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.295
So, they are not the only ones chasing me?

191
00:13:57.378 --> 00:13:59.005
Yeah, that's right.

192
00:13:59.505 --> 00:14:02.258
This is the result of living
against your fate.

193
00:14:02.341 --> 00:14:03.885
<i>Oh, man...</i>

194
00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:07.555
<i>I'm sweating so badly.</i>
<i>Is this because it's hot on stage?</i>

195
00:14:08.097 --> 00:14:09.682
<i>His duty is to sway</i>

196
00:14:09.766 --> 00:14:12.894
<i>a great variety of students</i>
<i>and thousands of souls at once.</i>

197
00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:16.731
<i>That's the curse the role of Adler carries</i>
<i>on his back.</i>

198
00:14:17.774 --> 00:14:20.026
No worries. I can take care of it.

199
00:14:20.568 --> 00:14:23.529
I will kill you. It's my duty.

200
00:14:26.157 --> 00:14:29.369
Don't forget!
I am Adler the Reaper!

201
00:14:31.579 --> 00:14:34.374
That Adler is not Rouis, is it?

202
00:14:34.457 --> 00:14:37.043
No, it's not. He doesn't have antlers.

203
00:14:37.585 --> 00:14:38.669
This is almost deceiving.

204
00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:44.133
I won't let anybody...

205
00:14:44.217 --> 00:14:45.093
<i>Calm down!</i>

206
00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:48.805
Until then, I won't let anybody touch you!

207
00:15:00.108 --> 00:15:01.234
Ellen,

208
00:15:01.317 --> 00:15:04.028
with the rose thorns you wished to see,

209
00:15:04.112 --> 00:15:06.781
even I, a Reaper,
would be able to end my own life.

210
00:15:07.365 --> 00:15:08.616
It'll be all right.

211
00:15:08.699 --> 00:15:11.160
There's no one chasing you anymore.

212
00:15:11.244 --> 00:15:12.703
I'm worried about him.

213
00:15:12.787 --> 00:15:15.039
Actually, he is doing fairly well.

214
00:15:15.748 --> 00:15:17.583
It's time for us to part, Ellen.

215
00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:19.544
This is my decision.

216
00:15:20.169 --> 00:15:23.089
I will choose where to die myself!

217
00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.009
Legoshi?

218
00:15:30.179 --> 00:15:31.472
<i>Hey, Bill.</i>

219
00:15:32.056 --> 00:15:36.018
<i>If you say the red blood you drank</i>
<i>was a reasonable doping,</i>

220
00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.063
<i>then show me what you've got.</i>

221
00:15:40.314 --> 00:15:41.941
So, are you the last evil?

222
00:15:46.195 --> 00:15:47.947
<i>I will destroy everything!</i>

223
00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:07.675
Hey, are you nuts?

224
00:16:13.848 --> 00:16:15.349
I will not forgive you!

225
00:16:18.478 --> 00:16:20.313
We have to stop him! Now!

226
00:16:20.396 --> 00:16:21.814
Can you?

227
00:16:26.235 --> 00:16:28.863
No... I can't.

228
00:16:29.447 --> 00:16:31.157
What? Who is that?

229
00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.159
He did punch him, didn't he?

230
00:16:33.951 --> 00:16:37.455
<i>Damn! What the hell is</i>
<i>this audience's reaction?</i>

231
00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:41.584
<i>They've been drawn into the play.</i>

232
00:17:08.653 --> 00:17:10.571
That's it, Legoshi.

233
00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:17.620
Are you trying to punish me?

234
00:17:18.454 --> 00:17:21.457
Do you think you are a perfect carnivore?

235
00:17:22.083 --> 00:17:23.793
You can't be, can you?

236
00:17:30.383 --> 00:17:31.759
You have...

237
00:17:31.842 --> 00:17:34.845
smelled rabbit's blood before,
haven't you?

238
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:37.265
Did you hurt it?

239
00:17:37.932 --> 00:17:39.183
Did you kill it?

240
00:17:44.063 --> 00:17:45.106
<i>I...</i>

241
00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:49.610
Calm down!

242
00:17:50.403 --> 00:17:52.780
You are no different from me!

243
00:17:53.322 --> 00:17:55.992
Those who got hands to kill!

244
00:17:59.912 --> 00:18:01.080
<i>Damn...</i>

245
00:18:02.582 --> 00:18:04.083
<i>It's warm...</i>

246
00:18:05.376 --> 00:18:08.129
Don't challenge me again, okay?

247
00:18:09.338 --> 00:18:14.093
I'm leaving these striped marks
on your back as a token of friendship.

248
00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:23.102
<i>The blood I feel on my back is</i>
<i>the same as his, carnivore's blood.</i>

249
00:18:25.354 --> 00:18:26.856
<i>It's warm,</i>

250
00:18:27.481 --> 00:18:29.150
<i>helpless and miserable.</i>

251
00:18:30.651 --> 00:18:34.614
<i>This blood has always tortured me.</i>

252
00:18:37.408 --> 00:18:38.451
Legoshi...

253
00:18:39.035 --> 00:18:41.203
You can barely stand, can you?

254
00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:42.913
Give up already.

255
00:18:42.997 --> 00:18:46.083
If you fall down now,
our play will beautifully end.

256
00:18:58.763 --> 00:19:00.556
You, a pathetic wolf...

257
00:19:01.432 --> 00:19:03.851
accept your destiny.

258
00:19:08.981 --> 00:19:10.691
I am the hero.

259
00:19:10.775 --> 00:19:13.402
Let me finish you off in style!

260
00:19:28.584 --> 00:19:30.711
Looks like you are having so much fun.

261
00:19:34.131 --> 00:19:36.884
Sorry, but I need you to play a villain.

262
00:19:37.885 --> 00:19:39.804
I know who you really are!

263
00:19:52.274 --> 00:19:53.818
You, the synthetic ghost,

264
00:19:53.901 --> 00:19:57.697
I'll show you who the real Reaper is.

265
00:19:58.989 --> 00:20:01.367
Legoshi, leave the rest to me.

266
00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:03.411
Don't let the audience see your back.

267
00:20:05.788 --> 00:20:07.540
Leave, if you are not determined.

268
00:20:08.708 --> 00:20:10.626
I know...

269
00:20:12.378 --> 00:20:14.880
the sins you have committed.

270
00:20:15.464 --> 00:20:17.341
Why don't you taste my blood, too?

271
00:20:18.217 --> 00:20:20.845
So that you will become a real Reaper.

272
00:20:22.263 --> 00:20:25.516
Now leave!
We are done with you, imposter!

273
00:20:35.401 --> 00:20:39.155
Go ahead. Disappear with morning dew.

274
00:20:39.905 --> 00:20:42.116
With me, who is coming to the end.

275
00:20:56.005 --> 00:20:59.049
Don't worry. You are right.

276
00:21:00.634 --> 00:21:02.511
<i>Rouis' skinny arm said to me,</i>

277
00:21:04.638 --> 00:21:06.515
<i>"Come on. Get up."</i>

278
00:21:23.574 --> 00:21:25.326
<i>The applause doesn't stop.</i>

279
00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.037
<i>I wonder what they think</i>

280
00:21:29.121 --> 00:21:30.164
<i>about this performance.</i>

281
00:23:04.008 --> 00:23:06.010
