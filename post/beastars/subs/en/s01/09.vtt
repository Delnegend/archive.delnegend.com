00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:49.359
<i>Hey, where's number four?</i>

2
00:01:49.443 --> 00:01:51.361
<i>-I can't find it.</i>
<i>-Hurry up.</i>

3
00:01:51.445 --> 00:01:52.863
<i>Don't tell me you lost it.</i>

4
00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:55.115
<i>Hurry up and give me number four!</i>

5
00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:04.207
-I found it!
-Thank goodness.

6
00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:05.334
Please, guys.

7
00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:07.461
We found bib number four.

8
00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:09.713
All right, let's start
our morning practice.

9
00:02:11.006 --> 00:02:12.841
<i>What a hellish number.</i>

10
00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:16.011
<i>It's been 13 years.</i>

11
00:02:16.678 --> 00:02:19.640
<i>The past is deeply engraved on my body.</i>

12
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.558
<i>Fine by me.</i>

13
00:02:22.184 --> 00:02:24.019
<i>If it's engraved in me forever,</i>

14
00:02:24.645 --> 00:02:26.647
<i>I'll just keep trampling on it.</i>

15
00:02:27.564 --> 00:02:30.525
<i>That's what I've been doing</i>
<i>ever since that day.</i>

16
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.946
Come here, number seven. Don't worry.

17
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.783
They'll give you a sleeping pill
before they eat you.

18
00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:41.578
What's the matter, number four?
Are you hungry?

19
00:02:41.662 --> 00:02:43.330
You already had a breakfast.

20
00:02:45.332 --> 00:02:47.709
<i>Four was my item number.</i>

21
00:02:48.794 --> 00:02:50.796
<i>I was five years old</i>

22
00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.965
<i>when I was being sold at the Black Market</i>
<i>as food for carnivores.</i>

23
00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:57.052
<i>I didn't know how to speak or read,</i>

24
00:02:57.844 --> 00:03:00.806
<i>but I did know</i>
<i>that leaving the cell meant death.</i>

25
00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:05.435
I never thought a person like you

26
00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.313
would visit such a filthy place.

27
00:03:08.397 --> 00:03:09.981
I didn't come here to chat.

28
00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:16.071
Let go!

29
00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:24.746
-Get back or I'll beat you.
-Put him back.

30
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.000
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

31
00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:34.131
<i>Did he do that for his friend?</i>

32
00:03:35.298 --> 00:03:37.008
<i>What a strong sense of justice.</i>

33
00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:39.928
<i>He has valiant eyes.</i>

34
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.723
I'll buy him.

35
00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:47.936
He never existed. Do you understand?

36
00:03:55.527 --> 00:03:58.155
<i>It was my first time</i>
<i>seeing an adult herbivore.</i>

37
00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.366
<i>I tried to run for my life.</i>

38
00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:05.954
<i>You don't feel like coming with me?</i>

39
00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:09.207
<i>I never go easy, even on children.</i>

40
00:04:15.464 --> 00:04:17.257
Hey, do we get to sample a deer?

41
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.634
He's still a child. Looks delicious.

42
00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:22.095
Don't be afraid, kid.

43
00:04:22.179 --> 00:04:23.847
Come over here.

44
00:04:25.056 --> 00:04:28.393
Here, protect yourself

45
00:04:28.477 --> 00:04:29.978
with that knife.

46
00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:56.630
So you tried to kill yourself

47
00:04:57.214 --> 00:04:59.800
rather than being eaten?

48
00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:01.927
Proud young man.

49
00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:05.931
I'm Ogma, Chairman
of the Horns Conglomerate.

50
00:05:06.515 --> 00:05:08.266
I couldn't have a baby.

51
00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:10.602
But from now on,

52
00:05:11.478 --> 00:05:14.105
you'll be my biological child.

53
00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:20.612
<i>I believe you can change the world.</i>

54
00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:33.041
Do you understand?

55
00:05:33.124 --> 00:05:35.877
Turn that frustration and sadness

56
00:05:36.711 --> 00:05:38.547
into your strength.

57
00:05:39.256 --> 00:05:42.884
<i>That's your mission.</i>

58
00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:45.595
<i>Rouis.</i>

59
00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:48.723
<i>My dear son.</i>

60
00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:55.272
Tem. I'll never forget your death.

61
00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:57.399
I made a vow

62
00:05:58.441 --> 00:06:00.944
to change this world.

63
00:06:01.987 --> 00:06:06.908
INTO THE LION'S DEN

64
00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:09.911
<i>It's been three months</i>
<i>since Tem's incident...</i>

65
00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:13.415
<i>The murderer hasn't been arrested yet.</i>

66
00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:17.502
You put it back again.

67
00:06:19.296 --> 00:06:21.006
I can't find the right timing.

68
00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:23.216
Don't worry.

69
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.552
I'll do it when the time is right.

70
00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:27.220
<i>I'll tell her how I feel.</i>

71
00:06:27.304 --> 00:06:30.056
<i>Tell her how I feel...</i>

72
00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:37.647
<i>I found out about Haru's feelings</i>
<i>after yesterday's blackout.</i>

73
00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:39.524
What did she say?

74
00:06:39.608 --> 00:06:41.693
Nothing in particular.

75
00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:43.320
We're friends, then.

76
00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:45.905
<i>Since way before I met Haru,</i>

77
00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:50.368
<i>I'm sure Rouis and Haru have already...</i>

78
00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:58.251
<i>What should I do?</i>

79
00:06:58.335 --> 00:07:00.253
<i>Any advice, Tem?</i>

80
00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:13.183
<i>I don't think anyone knows,</i>

81
00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:16.311
<i>because they avoid this place,</i>

82
00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:20.565
<i>that he still offers flowers</i>

83
00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:22.359
<i>for Tem.</i>

84
00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:24.736
<i>Rouis.</i>

85
00:07:40.335 --> 00:07:42.128
<i>He tried to attack Rouis.</i>

86
00:07:42.754 --> 00:07:43.755
<i>Why?</i>

87
00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:46.633
Sorry.

88
00:07:46.716 --> 00:07:47.759
Just let me go.

89
00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:52.180
Since when does Rouis have a bodyguard?

90
00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:54.724
I'm just his underclassman.

91
00:07:54.808 --> 00:07:57.978
Tell me. Why did you try to attack him?

92
00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:01.564
Why would I tell that
to his underclassman?

93
00:08:01.648 --> 00:08:03.316
Just give your paw to him.

94
00:08:05.986 --> 00:08:07.988
Fine, I'll tell you!

95
00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:11.408
You're...

96
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.202
a carnivore and you don't even know?

97
00:08:14.285 --> 00:08:18.790
There's a bunch of carnivore students
plotting to beat him up.

98
00:08:20.709 --> 00:08:24.879
It's almost certain Rouis is going to be
a Beastar after the festival.

99
00:08:24.963 --> 00:08:29.134
<i>If that happens, carnivores would be</i>
<i>forced into a weaker position.</i>

100
00:08:29.634 --> 00:08:34.514
So I thought I'd take a head start
to make my name.

101
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:39.602
You're a wolf. You understand
how we feel, right?

102
00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:43.732
<i>He settled the conflict</i>
<i>between a wolf and a tiger,</i>

103
00:08:44.232 --> 00:08:46.359
<i>he's got a perfect girlfriend,</i>

104
00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.821
<i>and he secretly offers flowers</i>
<i>to a deceased underclassman.</i>

105
00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:56.619
<i>On the other hand, I always end up</i>
<i>resolving things in a savage manner.</i>

106
00:08:57.537 --> 00:08:58.621
<i>A complete defeat.</i>

107
00:08:58.705 --> 00:09:00.123
That hurts!

108
00:09:01.458 --> 00:09:02.834
Stop it!

109
00:09:02.917 --> 00:09:07.172
<i>I shouldn't destroy</i>
<i>Rouis and Haru's relationship.</i>

110
00:09:08.256 --> 00:09:11.301
<i>And I've gradually started to realize</i>

111
00:09:11.968 --> 00:09:13.386
<i>what I should do.</i>

112
00:09:14.471 --> 00:09:17.432
<i>There's no other animal</i>
<i>who's perfect for a Beastar.</i>

113
00:09:18.308 --> 00:09:20.685
<i>If the carnivore students are against him,</i>

114
00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:22.228
<i>I'll protect Rouis.</i>

115
00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:26.066
<i>I don't mind if my love</i>
<i>stays unrequited forever.</i>

116
00:09:26.775 --> 00:09:28.526
<i>Because from the beginning--</i>

117
00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:33.823
It's impossible to protect Rouis
all by yourself.

118
00:09:33.907 --> 00:09:35.325
You idiot!

119
00:09:37.368 --> 00:09:39.370
<i>It sounds more serious than I thought.</i>

120
00:09:40.288 --> 00:09:45.043
<i>I have to move on so I can concentrate</i>
<i>on protecting Rouis.</i>

121
00:09:46.169 --> 00:09:47.504
<i>To do that...</i>

122
00:09:56.054 --> 00:09:57.263
Haru.

123
00:09:58.473 --> 00:09:59.682
<i>How awkward.</i>

124
00:10:01.476 --> 00:10:02.811
Legoshi...

125
00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:04.729
What's wrong?

126
00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:07.941
You're so hot-blooded.

127
00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:11.194
-What happened? Are you hurt?
-Well...

128
00:10:11.903 --> 00:10:15.031
<i>Confessing love... I've never done it.</i>

129
00:10:15.698 --> 00:10:18.952
<i>And I'm doing it</i>
<i>knowing that I won't succeed.</i>

130
00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:20.453
No fighting, okay?

131
00:10:21.162 --> 00:10:22.205
Haru.

132
00:10:23.248 --> 00:10:25.625
I... I...

133
00:10:26.543 --> 00:10:28.837
-I love you--
-Why...

134
00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.172
do I have so many mosquito bites today?

135
00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:36.136
-It doesn't look like it.
-You can't see it.

136
00:10:36.219 --> 00:10:39.222
-I don't smell it, though.
-Your right nostril is clogged.

137
00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:40.640
Well...

138
00:10:40.723 --> 00:10:41.766
The thing is...

139
00:10:42.517 --> 00:10:43.685
I...

140
00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:47.188
-I love... you!
-My ears are itchy.

141
00:10:48.982 --> 00:10:50.316
Wait.

142
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.653
Are you interrupting me on purpose? Why?

143
00:10:53.736 --> 00:10:56.447
That's my question. Why are you telling me

144
00:10:56.531 --> 00:10:59.617
such an important thing so casually
with a tissue up your nose?

145
00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:02.078
And I'm not prepared for it.
I can't believe this.

146
00:11:02.162 --> 00:11:03.413
Haru.

147
00:11:04.247 --> 00:11:07.167
I don't intend on ruining anything
because of this feeling.

148
00:11:08.459 --> 00:11:11.296
You're special, but I also respect Rouis.

149
00:11:12.297 --> 00:11:14.924
In hard times like this,

150
00:11:15.008 --> 00:11:16.467
I just want to stay harmless.

151
00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:18.970
So...

152
00:11:19.053 --> 00:11:21.222
I'll say this only once.

153
00:11:21.306 --> 00:11:23.558
Will you listen to me?

154
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:31.149
Let's meet here in the evening tomorrow

155
00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:32.942
at the Festival of the Meteor.

156
00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:36.905
I want to tell you
about my feelings properly.

157
00:11:38.948 --> 00:11:41.534
I understand it was a bit sudden,

158
00:11:42.118 --> 00:11:45.997
so if you know we're meeting tomorrow,
you can be prepared.

159
00:11:47.165 --> 00:11:49.709
<i>That's a lot of burden, too.</i>

160
00:11:51.502 --> 00:11:52.795
Okay.

161
00:11:54.005 --> 00:11:55.548
See you tomorrow, then.

162
00:11:56.674 --> 00:11:58.760
Take care of your nose.

163
00:12:02.847 --> 00:12:04.265
<i>What should I do?</i>

164
00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:08.603
<i>It's been years since I've gotten</i>
<i>stressed out over a guy.</i>

165
00:12:10.188 --> 00:12:11.731
<i>Staying harmless...</i>

166
00:12:12.774 --> 00:12:16.152
<i>That's impossible, Legoshi.</i>

167
00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.197
<i>As long as there's instinct in this world,</i>

168
00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:22.784
<i>it's inevitable to make</i>
<i>yourself or others suffer.</i>

169
00:12:24.202 --> 00:12:26.329
<i>Isn't that right, Legoshi--</i>

170
00:12:39.884 --> 00:12:42.929
STUDENT ID - NAME: SHEILA
CLASSIFICATION: LEOPARD

171
00:12:45.139 --> 00:12:46.808
I'm sure.

172
00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:50.311
This shoe belongs
to that white dwarf rabbit.

173
00:12:50.395 --> 00:12:51.938
It has her smell, too.

174
00:12:52.021 --> 00:12:53.356
How do you know that?

175
00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:56.192
That's because...

176
00:12:57.276 --> 00:12:59.445
We should call the police immediately.

177
00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:02.156
I found this with the shoe.

178
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.284
Shishi-Gumi?

179
00:13:05.868 --> 00:13:08.121
If the Shishi-Gumi's behind this,

180
00:13:08.204 --> 00:13:09.831
I'm not sure if the police would help.

181
00:13:09.914 --> 00:13:12.000
What's Shishi-Gumi?

182
00:13:12.083 --> 00:13:13.626
Don't ask.

183
00:13:14.502 --> 00:13:15.795
Mayor.

184
00:13:15.878 --> 00:13:19.799
Leave this to me.
You must keep this to yourselves,

185
00:13:19.882 --> 00:13:21.676
or your lives will be in danger.

186
00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:26.180
We'll secretly investigate
until we find her.

187
00:13:26.889 --> 00:13:29.100
Thank you, Mayor.

188
00:13:29.183 --> 00:13:30.852
Haru must be okay, then.

189
00:13:30.935 --> 00:13:33.604
The mayor's here, so she should be fine.

190
00:13:37.734 --> 00:13:41.029
<i>I can't let them cause a scene here.</i>

191
00:13:41.696 --> 00:13:46.242
<i>There's not much I can do</i>
<i>for the kidnapped girl anyway.</i>

192
00:13:47.869 --> 00:13:51.831
<i>I won't let a lame organization</i>
<i>destroy what I've built.</i>

193
00:13:57.336 --> 00:13:59.297
You still have feelings for her?

194
00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:00.882
You have a girlfriend, dude.

195
00:14:00.965 --> 00:14:04.510
I never thought
she'd get kidnapped, though.

196
00:14:05.136 --> 00:14:06.387
Haru...

197
00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:08.931
Haru?

198
00:14:13.144 --> 00:14:18.024
I helped you guys out
by cutting the power off yesterday,

199
00:14:18.107 --> 00:14:22.070
and this is all you've got
for boss' dinner?

200
00:14:22.153 --> 00:14:23.321
We did our best.

201
00:14:23.905 --> 00:14:26.741
Snow white from head to toe
is rare to find.

202
00:14:26.824 --> 00:14:28.201
Lift your head.

203
00:14:31.037 --> 00:14:34.082
Apparently, creatures without pigments
taste superb.

204
00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:37.710
At least be a delicious meat
for him, all right?

205
00:14:46.928 --> 00:14:49.806
Perhaps we should break her legs
so she won't run away.

206
00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:51.724
No. Don't!

207
00:14:51.808 --> 00:14:54.936
Let me check if you really are
entirely white.

208
00:14:55.019 --> 00:14:57.688
No, let me go! Someone!

209
00:14:57.772 --> 00:14:59.941
Nobody's coming to help you.

210
00:15:01.317 --> 00:15:02.819
What are you doing?

211
00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:09.242
She's only a bunny.

212
00:15:10.243 --> 00:15:11.244
Boss.

213
00:15:12.954 --> 00:15:14.330
Poor thing.

214
00:15:15.123 --> 00:15:16.874
You look scared.

215
00:15:17.542 --> 00:15:19.961
I apologize for their rudeness.

216
00:15:20.753 --> 00:15:22.130
Are you hurt?

217
00:15:25.258 --> 00:15:28.719
SHI

218
00:15:28.803 --> 00:15:30.304
So...

219
00:15:30.388 --> 00:15:32.181
it's just us two now.

220
00:15:33.141 --> 00:15:34.517
Don't worry.

221
00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.602
I won't hurt you.

222
00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:40.356
You look young. How old are you?

223
00:15:42.525 --> 00:15:43.860
Eighteen.

224
00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:45.361
So you're still in high school.

225
00:15:45.987 --> 00:15:47.697
Are you having fun at school?

226
00:15:49.031 --> 00:15:51.075
Well... I don't know.

227
00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:52.743
You don't know?

228
00:15:53.744 --> 00:15:56.247
It's okay. No need to talk
if you don't want to.

229
00:15:57.123 --> 00:15:58.791
Don't worry.

230
00:15:58.875 --> 00:16:01.627
I respect you.

231
00:16:02.336 --> 00:16:04.755
Now, take off your clothes.

232
00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:09.010
Take them off by yourself

233
00:16:09.093 --> 00:16:12.722
and show me how precious
of a food you are.

234
00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:18.728
Or would you rather have my guys
rip off your clothes?

235
00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:33.993
Everything.

236
00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.704
Don't stop the flow.

237
00:16:47.381 --> 00:16:48.633
I hope you understand.

238
00:16:49.383 --> 00:16:52.512
I don't intend to assault you.

239
00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.648
This is a necessary step...

240
00:17:04.815 --> 00:17:09.487
to eat your flesh
in the perfect condition.

241
00:17:11.405 --> 00:17:13.658
I'm dropping the cable. Set up the ladder.

242
00:17:13.741 --> 00:17:15.159
Here's the ladder.

243
00:17:16.202 --> 00:17:19.288
Why are you only telling me this?

244
00:17:20.706 --> 00:17:24.669
I need you to understand
the world of grown-ups.

245
00:17:25.419 --> 00:17:27.421
Once you become a Beastar,

246
00:17:27.505 --> 00:17:30.591
you'll have a hard time
with the Shishi-Gumi.

247
00:17:31.884 --> 00:17:33.344
Were you friends

248
00:17:33.427 --> 00:17:35.680
with that girl who got kidnapped?

249
00:17:38.558 --> 00:17:39.642
That's fine.

250
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:42.603
Covering this up

251
00:17:42.687 --> 00:17:44.981
wouldn't solve anything.

252
00:17:45.606 --> 00:17:47.316
There must be a way.

253
00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.819
The public values

254
00:17:49.902 --> 00:17:54.407
information that is received
with their own eyes and ears.

255
00:17:55.324 --> 00:17:59.412
I need you to have a firm resolve

256
00:17:59.495 --> 00:18:01.122
to never let this be known.

257
00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:07.044
Right before I entered the university,

258
00:18:07.128 --> 00:18:09.338
I had replaced all my fangs with dentures.

259
00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:14.844
I also spent four million
on plastic surgery to look kind.

260
00:18:15.595 --> 00:18:17.722
All to become a mayor.

261
00:18:18.681 --> 00:18:20.558
I made the public believe

262
00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:24.645
that lions have a good heart.
If that's destroyed,

263
00:18:24.729 --> 00:18:29.817
herbivores and carnivores
would polarize even more,

264
00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.945
and this city will fall into disorder.

265
00:18:34.864 --> 00:18:39.118
This serves as a final test
for you as well.

266
00:18:41.495 --> 00:18:43.914
Here's the list of food
sold at the Black Market.

267
00:18:43.998 --> 00:18:46.375
Your record is still in here.

268
00:18:47.084 --> 00:18:49.378
If you remain silent on this case

269
00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:52.965
and finish the Festival of the Meteor
without any troubles,

270
00:18:53.758 --> 00:18:57.511
I'll smother your past

271
00:18:58.346 --> 00:19:00.598
as a reward.

272
00:19:11.901 --> 00:19:14.904
Great. It's a deal.

273
00:19:16.906 --> 00:19:19.116
That's all from me.

274
00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.203
You can return to your fellow actors now.

275
00:19:27.291 --> 00:19:29.293
Damn!

276
00:19:29.377 --> 00:19:31.754
<i>That Mayor, the Shishi-Gumi...</i>

277
00:19:31.837 --> 00:19:32.880
Rouis!

278
00:19:35.091 --> 00:19:37.802
Haru's been kidnapped by... What was it?

279
00:19:37.885 --> 00:19:39.970
A group called Shishi-Gumi.

280
00:19:40.054 --> 00:19:41.722
We have to rescue her.

281
00:19:45.101 --> 00:19:46.769
It happens a lot.

282
00:19:46.852 --> 00:19:48.187
It's too late.

283
00:19:51.315 --> 00:19:53.067
What are you saying?

284
00:19:54.318 --> 00:19:55.861
You need to go help her--

285
00:19:55.945 --> 00:19:57.655
Then do it by yourself.

286
00:19:57.738 --> 00:19:59.198
You love her, don't you?

287
00:19:59.281 --> 00:20:01.242
She loves you, too.

288
00:20:02.243 --> 00:20:04.161
Don't talk like you know everything.

289
00:20:04.787 --> 00:20:09.834
I don't expect a wolf pretending to be
weak and living carefree to understand.

290
00:20:12.503 --> 00:20:14.255
We can't do anything.

291
00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.425
I can't let the whole city be in chaos
for one life.

292
00:20:20.845 --> 00:20:23.931
<i>I have to convince myself.</i>

293
00:20:24.807 --> 00:20:27.101
You need lies and deception
to maintain peace.

294
00:20:28.436 --> 00:20:30.479
You prove that with your own existence.

295
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:34.817
You deceive everyone else
by hiding your real power.

296
00:20:38.529 --> 00:20:39.488
Okay.

297
00:20:41.949 --> 00:20:46.078
Then I'll let you know with my real power

298
00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:49.540
how much danger Haru's in right now.

299
00:20:51.083 --> 00:20:52.585
How angry I am at you!

300
00:21:00.301 --> 00:21:01.385
Rouis.

301
00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:07.933
<i>Why? You already have everything you want.</i>

302
00:21:08.017 --> 00:21:10.394
<i>And you're throwing your frustration at me</i>

303
00:21:10.478 --> 00:21:12.271
<i>for not being able to rescue her?</i>

304
00:21:13.147 --> 00:21:15.566
<i>If all you can do is walk</i>
<i>in a straight line,</i>

305
00:21:16.484 --> 00:21:19.195
<i>then I can no longer rely on you.</i>

306
00:21:19.779 --> 00:21:21.989
I don't care if you rise to the top

307
00:21:22.615 --> 00:21:25.117
by being clever.

308
00:21:25.826 --> 00:21:27.203
But in return...

309
00:21:28.621 --> 00:21:31.582
Haru will be mine.

310
00:23:03.966 --> 00:23:05.968
