1
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.946
We're in a fix.

2
00:01:53.655 --> 00:01:56.533
He left his belongings and disappeared.

3
00:01:56.617 --> 00:01:59.077
The Festival of the Meteor is tomorrow.

4
00:01:59.161 --> 00:02:02.914
But we haven't seen Legoshi today,
not even once.

5
00:02:02.998 --> 00:02:04.833
He's not the type to ditch,

6
00:02:04.916 --> 00:02:07.419
so I'm sure he has a compelling reason.

7
00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:12.215
Hello?

8
00:02:12.924 --> 00:02:14.968
What? You're missing one, too?

9
00:02:16.428 --> 00:02:18.597
Sorry, we've got to go.

10
00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:24.311
TO THE NEON DISTRICT

11
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.649
It's raining outside, too. I'm worried.

12
00:02:28.732 --> 00:02:30.859
You have no idea either, Jack?

13
00:02:30.942 --> 00:02:35.155
Not at all. It doesn't look like
he's been back here.

14
00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:39.910
Kabu is dead!

15
00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:41.578
Kabu?

16
00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:44.164
The beetle Legoshi rescued.

17
00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:46.875
Legoshi would get depressed about it.

18
00:02:47.793 --> 00:02:49.670
That's a bad sign.

19
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.090
Legoshi was giving him a lot of love.

20
00:02:54.758 --> 00:02:55.926
Kabu.

21
00:02:56.426 --> 00:02:58.428
You can walk quite a lot now.

22
00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:01.431
I'm glad he's gotten better.

23
00:03:02.307 --> 00:03:03.725
He owes you one.

24
00:03:05.477 --> 00:03:07.687
Do you... think so?

25
00:03:08.814 --> 00:03:09.689
I...

26
00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:13.944
How do I put it?

27
00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:16.822
I'm just doing it to please myself.

28
00:03:17.572 --> 00:03:19.282
It might just be annoying
for the receiving end.

29
00:03:19.783 --> 00:03:20.784
The receiving end?

30
00:03:22.244 --> 00:03:24.579
An animal like me...

31
00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:28.792
can never close the distance
with small, fragile creatures.

32
00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:31.336
Could it be...

33
00:03:31.962 --> 00:03:34.714
that you're still distressed
about that rabbit girl?

34
00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:54.443
<i>"You'll never understand this feeling</i>
<i>of being a hair's breadth from death."</i>

35
00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:57.487
<i>She's totally right.</i>

36
00:03:58.071 --> 00:04:00.449
<i>As long as I'm a carnivore,</i>

37
00:04:00.532 --> 00:04:02.868
<i>I can never understand her.</i>

38
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.579
-Legoshi.
-Haru.

39
00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:08.290
Run away now. Hurry!

40
00:04:08.874 --> 00:04:10.959
I can't do that.

41
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.464
But if it's going to end
without mutual understanding,

42
00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:19.801
what's the purpose of
being born as a wolf?

43
00:04:20.635 --> 00:04:23.972
That might be what everyone's
searching for, after all.

44
00:04:25.015 --> 00:04:29.978
Adults and children. Carnivores and
herbivores. They're all struggling.

45
00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:39.946
<i>Species are decided</i>
<i>the moment they're born,</i>

46
00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:42.991
<i>so they want a purpose they can accept.</i>

47
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.037
You're a tough one to chew on.

48
00:04:47.871 --> 00:04:50.707
This will be the end, kid.

49
00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:54.836
Yes, I agree.

50
00:04:57.631 --> 00:05:00.050
<i>I've started to realize, Jack,</i>

51
00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:03.929
<i>the purpose of being born a wolf.</i>

52
00:05:05.806 --> 00:05:08.725
I probably shouldn't be
showing this to you.

53
00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:14.231
I'm sorry, Haru.

54
00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:26.076
<i>There's nothing to be afraid of.</i>

55
00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:36.211
<i>These nails are for you.</i>
<i>These fangs are for you.</i>

56
00:05:36.711 --> 00:05:40.048
<i>I'll be your beast.</i>

57
00:06:00.902 --> 00:06:03.446
<i>Do I look like a devil to you?</i>

58
00:06:05.282 --> 00:06:08.076
Haru. It's all right now.

59
00:06:08.827 --> 00:06:11.663
<i>You're free to decide.</i>

60
00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:16.459
Would you run away with me?

61
00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:20.589
Legoshi.

62
00:06:22.299 --> 00:06:26.428
<i>Would you tame this gray wolf?</i>

63
00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:29.431
My body's shivering.

64
00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.028
I'm glad.

65
00:06:43.903 --> 00:06:44.904
Really.

66
00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:50.285
Legoshi.

67
00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:55.915
<i>I came this far wanting to be forgiven...</i>

68
00:06:57.417 --> 00:06:59.377
<i>for the fact that I was born a carnivore.</i>

69
00:07:00.962 --> 00:07:02.589
<i>That I'm in love with you.</i>

70
00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:09.763
GOOD LUCK IN BATTLE

71
00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:15.018
Did you do all this, Legoshi?

72
00:07:15.894 --> 00:07:17.187
No way.

73
00:07:18.063 --> 00:07:21.733
An old panda came with me here.

74
00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:26.237
Walk straight.

75
00:07:27.364 --> 00:07:30.492
Can you walk?

76
00:07:31.743 --> 00:07:33.036
<i>That kid.</i>

77
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.247
<i>He deliberately missed my vital spot.</i>

78
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:40.543
<i>This man will teach you</i>
<i>something important for the last time.</i>

79
00:07:44.381 --> 00:07:46.132
A callow kindness...

80
00:07:47.258 --> 00:07:49.010
can be deadly.

81
00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:02.732
I won't let you meddle
with her ever again.

82
00:08:04.234 --> 00:08:06.695
Beg for your life now.

83
00:08:08.947 --> 00:08:11.074
Do it right here, right now.

84
00:08:11.658 --> 00:08:14.577
Show me the face of you carnivores

85
00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:16.413
shivering in terror.

86
00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:19.249
Cry your eyes out!
Come on, plead for forgiveness!

87
00:08:29.384 --> 00:08:30.969
What a pity.

88
00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:34.389
I've got something to teach you, too.

89
00:08:35.306 --> 00:08:38.226
There's no such thing as
saving grace in this world.

90
00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:41.855
<i>I'll dissolve into darkness.</i>

91
00:08:45.734 --> 00:08:46.818
Who are you?

92
00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:48.028
Drop that gun!

93
00:08:48.111 --> 00:08:51.698
<i>I'm done fighting against rotten adults.</i>

94
00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:57.746
<i>Lose all honor and pride,</i>
<i>and let go of everything.</i>

95
00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:02.667
I'm number four. Item number four.

96
00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:07.630
I'm small and weak,
but I can guarantee I'm tasty.

97
00:09:08.882 --> 00:09:11.176
Don't leave anything
other than the antlers.

98
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.386
Devour gratefully.

99
00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:28.943
STUDENT ID - NAME: MIZUCHI
CLASSIFICATION: HARLEQUIN RABBIT

100
00:09:39.788 --> 00:09:40.955
Legoshi.

101
00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:47.045
Thank goodness. You haven't moved
an inch, I thought you were dead.

102
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.924
I'm totally alive.

103
00:09:51.508 --> 00:09:52.592
I'm really...

104
00:09:53.885 --> 00:09:55.762
I'm really sorry, Legoshi.

105
00:09:56.471 --> 00:09:58.306
-Just for me--
-Haru.

106
00:09:58.973 --> 00:10:00.558
It's fine. I just--

107
00:10:00.642 --> 00:10:03.895
-Just to save me, you--
-I just...

108
00:10:07.065 --> 00:10:09.109
want to eat something.

109
00:10:11.236 --> 00:10:14.114
Here, one big yakisoba with egg.

110
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.700
Looks delicious. You eat too, Haru.

111
00:10:17.784 --> 00:10:20.036
You look pretty beaten up, son.

112
00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.246
Eat a lot.

113
00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:22.622
Thanks.

114
00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:27.877
You're so prepared for a 17-year old,

115
00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:31.089
hiding money in your shoe
for an emergency.

116
00:10:31.673 --> 00:10:35.593
My grandpa used to tell me to do that
when I was small.

117
00:10:35.677 --> 00:10:38.221
You were Grandpa's little boy?

118
00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:39.931
Well...

119
00:10:40.723 --> 00:10:42.892
that was a long time ago,

120
00:10:44.102 --> 00:10:45.603
when I was a kid.

121
00:10:47.772 --> 00:10:50.066
<i>Legoshi's and my life</i>

122
00:10:50.608 --> 00:10:52.986
<i>are starting to mingle quietly.</i>

123
00:10:54.237 --> 00:10:57.657
<i>The guy who saved me</i>
<i>by staking his own life</i>

124
00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.285
<i>is eating cheap yakisoba in front of me.</i>

125
00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:05.832
<i>This vision could be my lifelong treasure.</i>

126
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.209
<i>That's why,</i>

127
00:11:09.836 --> 00:11:13.965
<i>while this memory is beautiful...</i>

128
00:11:15.842 --> 00:11:18.636
Let's get back by train
once we're done eating.

129
00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.221
-Yeah.
-What?

130
00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:22.265
You've missed the last train.

131
00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:28.730
HUMIDITY IS STILL HIGH

132
00:11:29.314 --> 00:11:32.108
How much money do you have now?

133
00:11:34.027 --> 00:11:36.946
About 4,500 yen.

134
00:11:37.906 --> 00:11:40.116
<i>I guess it won't let me end this</i>
<i>that easily.</i>

135
00:11:41.284 --> 00:11:43.161
<i>-Because...</i>
-Haru.

136
00:11:44.787 --> 00:11:47.373
Let's find lodging for the night.

137
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:51.252
<i>A summer's night can be very long.</i>

138
00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:55.256
All right. Legoshi.

139
00:11:55.882 --> 00:11:57.759
A total violation.

140
00:11:58.343 --> 00:12:01.220
He committed a serious violation,

141
00:12:01.804 --> 00:12:02.931
staying out without permission.

142
00:12:03.014 --> 00:12:05.725
Your roommate is a true delinquent.

143
00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.687
Weren't there any signs
of this delinquency?

144
00:12:09.771 --> 00:12:10.688
Signs?

145
00:12:11.272 --> 00:12:17.195
For example, showing great interest
in a female, small animal student.

146
00:12:17.695 --> 00:12:18.821
NO RUNNING IN HALLWAY

147
00:12:18.905 --> 00:12:23.034
What are you talking about?
That doesn't matter, does it?

148
00:12:23.117 --> 00:12:24.285
Actually,

149
00:12:24.953 --> 00:12:26.496
it really does matter.

150
00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:30.959
I've been notified that a female
dwarf rabbit hasn't returned to her dorm.

151
00:12:31.459 --> 00:12:32.835
And this.

152
00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:35.630
It's Legoshi's backpack
delivered to the boy's dorm.

153
00:12:35.713 --> 00:12:39.133
The problem is what's in his backpack.

154
00:12:39.717 --> 00:12:41.511
RABBIT BEHAVIORS
HOW TO BEFRIEND SMALL ANIMALS

155
00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:44.555
They were in Legoshi's backpack?

156
00:12:45.139 --> 00:12:47.725
There's no doubt!

157
00:12:47.809 --> 00:12:51.020
A male wolf and a female rabbit
are away overnight without permission.

158
00:12:51.104 --> 00:12:55.149
If something goes wrong,
it could be a serious problem.

159
00:12:55.233 --> 00:12:57.110
This is immoral...

160
00:12:57.193 --> 00:13:00.279
<i>Nah, he should be fine.</i>

161
00:13:02.824 --> 00:13:07.203
Legoshi. It says here
"interspecies couples okay."

162
00:13:07.286 --> 00:13:09.038
Let's stay in this hotel.

163
00:13:09.831 --> 00:13:10.957
Haru.

164
00:13:12.166 --> 00:13:13.918
Isn't this...

165
00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:16.713
It can't be helped.

166
00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:17.922
Business hotels are too expensive.

167
00:13:18.589 --> 00:13:21.050
Don't worry, you look old enough.

168
00:13:22.969 --> 00:13:24.303
So, what do you say?

169
00:13:24.387 --> 00:13:26.139
It's embarrassing standing here.

170
00:13:26.723 --> 00:13:28.016
Actually...

171
00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:30.852
I'll just sleep outside.

172
00:13:31.561 --> 00:13:32.770
You stay here alone.

173
00:13:33.771 --> 00:13:34.772
Why?

174
00:13:35.314 --> 00:13:36.899
I mean...

175
00:13:36.983 --> 00:13:40.319
you'd been kidnapped by carnivores
until just a while ago.

176
00:13:41.195 --> 00:13:45.116
And you're going to stay in the same room
as me on that same night?

177
00:13:47.368 --> 00:13:50.121
But you're the one who saved me.

178
00:13:50.913 --> 00:13:52.498
What are you scared of?

179
00:13:52.582 --> 00:13:55.084
You saved me from a bunch of lion yakuzas.

180
00:13:56.711 --> 00:13:58.337
That's exactly why I'm scared.

181
00:13:58.921 --> 00:14:00.798
<i>I fought a really dangerous fight,</i>

182
00:14:00.882 --> 00:14:02.258
<i>saved a girl I like,</i>

183
00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:05.136
<i>had dinner, and regained my energy.</i>

184
00:14:05.636 --> 00:14:07.305
I hate to admit, but...

185
00:14:07.889 --> 00:14:10.933
right now, I'm probably...

186
00:14:11.517 --> 00:14:12.894
pretty much in a male mode.

187
00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:17.106
If we spend the night together
in such a place,

188
00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:19.150
and something happens...

189
00:14:19.233 --> 00:14:21.819
It'll be all right. You're Legoshi.

190
00:14:24.364 --> 00:14:28.951
Whatever you do,
you can never be wrong tonight, Legoshi.

191
00:14:30.286 --> 00:14:32.789
You've accomplished something that great.

192
00:14:40.713 --> 00:14:42.548
<i>Isn't it going too fast?</i>

193
00:14:44.258 --> 00:14:47.053
<i>Am I going straight to the rooftop?</i>

194
00:14:47.595 --> 00:14:50.348
<i>There are so many floors left</i>
<i>that I need to explore.</i>

195
00:14:50.848 --> 00:14:51.933
<i>Impossible!</i>

196
00:14:52.517 --> 00:14:55.603
<i>But it was undoubtedly my actions today,</i>

197
00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:57.980
<i>that messed up this escalator.</i>

198
00:14:58.564 --> 00:15:00.274
<i>Wait, why an escalator?</i>

199
00:15:00.358 --> 00:15:03.069
<i>I can't take this anymore! I'm confused!</i>

200
00:15:08.658 --> 00:15:10.034
I'm going to lower the AC.

201
00:15:10.618 --> 00:15:13.538
Do wolves have resistance to hot or cold?

202
00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:18.000
If I had to choose,

203
00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:19.836
cold, I guess.

204
00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:21.629
Same as me.

205
00:15:23.548 --> 00:15:25.091
<i>Dials at the headboard.</i>

206
00:15:25.633 --> 00:15:27.552
<i>Mirrors all over the wall.</i>

207
00:15:29.011 --> 00:15:30.471
<i>I kind of knew of all these,</i>

208
00:15:30.972 --> 00:15:32.515
<i>but they really do exist.</i>

209
00:15:32.598 --> 00:15:35.351
Too bad, they don't have karaoke.

210
00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:40.648
You've been to a place like this before?

211
00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:43.401
I have.

212
00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:48.531
But I've never been this nervous.

213
00:15:51.117 --> 00:15:52.076
Why don't you sit?

214
00:16:02.879 --> 00:16:05.298
Sorry, that was a big rebound.

215
00:16:05.381 --> 00:16:08.509
I wonder how many of me you weigh.

216
00:16:09.719 --> 00:16:12.180
It feels like you're bigger
than when we first met.

217
00:16:33.534 --> 00:16:34.494
Clothes!

218
00:16:34.577 --> 00:16:37.622
Maybe you should wash your clothes
and hang them up.

219
00:16:38.789 --> 00:16:40.374
I mean...

220
00:16:41.125 --> 00:16:43.127
you should wash your clothes.

221
00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:47.173
What?

222
00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:50.718
You heard me.

223
00:16:51.636 --> 00:16:54.222
You can't ride the train
in that bloodstained shirt.

224
00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.435
<i>Did I just attempt...</i>

225
00:17:00.394 --> 00:17:01.437
<i>to kiss her?</i>

226
00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:03.856
Raise your arms. I'm taking it off.

227
00:17:05.441 --> 00:17:08.778
<i>Ever since I met her, I've changed a lot.</i>

228
00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:11.489
Legoshi.

229
00:17:13.032 --> 00:17:15.993
I didn't know you were this wounded. Why?

230
00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:20.748
Ever since I met you.

231
00:17:22.833 --> 00:17:25.795
<i>It was still cold that night.</i>

232
00:17:26.712 --> 00:17:29.590
<i>A quiet night with only</i>
<i>the sound of the fountain.</i>

233
00:17:32.176 --> 00:17:33.177
Legoshi.

234
00:17:36.138 --> 00:17:39.308
<i>Everything about me has changed</i>
<i>since that day.</i>

235
00:17:43.354 --> 00:17:47.191
There's something I've been hiding
from you this whole time.

236
00:17:48.526 --> 00:17:50.444
The first time I met you...

237
00:17:51.237 --> 00:17:52.738
wasn't at the rooftop garden.

238
00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:55.575
That monster...

239
00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.119
who attacked you behind the auditorium...

240
00:18:00.871 --> 00:18:01.956
was me.

241
00:18:02.665 --> 00:18:05.876
I was seriously going to eat you.

242
00:18:06.836 --> 00:18:07.795
I...

243
00:18:09.463 --> 00:18:10.631
Legoshi.

244
00:18:12.216 --> 00:18:13.593
This whole time...

245
00:18:14.719 --> 00:18:16.512
I pretended that I didn't know.

246
00:18:18.681 --> 00:18:22.310
It's not like
I've always been suspecting you.

247
00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:25.438
But there were a couple of occasions

248
00:18:25.521 --> 00:18:27.189
that made me think so.

249
00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:31.611
So I couldn't understand you even more.

250
00:18:33.404 --> 00:18:35.906
<i>Were you going to eat me eventually,</i>

251
00:18:37.325 --> 00:18:39.035
<i>or did you have other intentions?</i>

252
00:18:40.369 --> 00:18:42.121
<i>Why were you nice to me?</i>

253
00:18:44.165 --> 00:18:48.419
Because it was fun being with you.

254
00:18:50.755 --> 00:18:52.006
Hey, Legoshi.

255
00:18:52.882 --> 00:18:54.842
Our true selves...

256
00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.846
are frozen in time in this position.

257
00:19:01.432 --> 00:19:02.850
From here on,

258
00:19:04.143 --> 00:19:05.645
you lead.

259
00:19:07.063 --> 00:19:07.938
Will you sleep,

260
00:19:09.148 --> 00:19:10.149
or eat?

261
00:19:11.776 --> 00:19:13.277
You decide.

262
00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:22.119
I can't, Haru.

263
00:19:24.872 --> 00:19:28.292
Your heartbeat could make me bounce.

264
00:19:29.627 --> 00:19:31.921
This seems to be killing you
more than the fight earlier.

265
00:19:34.173 --> 00:19:35.466
Of course.

266
00:19:36.967 --> 00:19:39.011
You want me to choose?

267
00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:43.391
You already know the answer, Haru.

268
00:19:44.475 --> 00:19:45.559
I don't.

269
00:19:46.727 --> 00:19:48.396
You decide, Legoshi.

270
00:19:59.281 --> 00:20:00.491
Sorry.

271
00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.576
My hands are trembling.

272
00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.579
It's all right. Slowly.

273
00:20:06.163 --> 00:20:08.958
<i>Wait. Is this okay?</i>

274
00:20:09.875 --> 00:20:11.293
<i>She's so small.</i>

275
00:20:11.377 --> 00:20:13.671
<i>Her body's too small. Really.</i>

276
00:20:14.672 --> 00:20:17.591
<i>My hand can almost cover up</i>
<i>her whole body.</i>

277
00:20:18.384 --> 00:20:22.471
<i>It's soft,</i>
<i>but there's something hard inside.</i>

278
00:20:23.681 --> 00:20:25.141
<i>Are these ribs?</i>

279
00:20:25.766 --> 00:20:29.019
<i>So these two mochi sort of things are...</i>

280
00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.274
-Your nails...
-Sorry.

281
00:20:34.024 --> 00:20:35.109
It's fine.

282
00:20:36.193 --> 00:20:37.695
Keep on going, Legoshi.

283
00:20:39.572 --> 00:20:40.906
You're being too nervous.

284
00:20:41.657 --> 00:20:43.033
Let's lie down.

285
00:20:44.952 --> 00:20:46.162
Am I too heavy?

286
00:20:46.746 --> 00:20:48.581
No, it's fine.

287
00:20:48.664 --> 00:20:50.082
<i>Calm down.</i>

288
00:20:50.791 --> 00:20:53.669
<i>Don't hurt her. Don't scare her.</i>

289
00:20:58.007 --> 00:21:00.009
<i>That's a voice I've never heard.</i>

290
00:21:02.678 --> 00:21:03.596
Haru.

291
00:21:04.263 --> 00:21:05.264
Haru.

292
00:21:06.724 --> 00:21:07.892
Legoshi.

293
00:21:12.062 --> 00:21:12.980
No way.

294
00:21:13.939 --> 00:21:15.858
Legoshi, sorry.

295
00:21:16.692 --> 00:21:18.235
My body's moving by itself,

296
00:21:18.819 --> 00:21:21.280
trying to get inside your mouth.

297
00:21:23.491 --> 00:21:24.366
<i>This is...</i>

298
00:21:25.409 --> 00:21:27.703
<i>a reprimand from my rabbit genes...</i>

299
00:21:29.038 --> 00:21:30.998
<i>telling me that loving each other...</i>

300
00:21:32.041 --> 00:21:34.168
<i>is a terrible mistake.</i>

301
00:23:03.966 --> 00:23:05.968
