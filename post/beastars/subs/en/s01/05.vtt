1
00:01:47.482 --> 00:01:49.109
Extra!

2
00:01:49.192 --> 00:01:52.571
Here's the truth behind
the drama club's second performance!

3
00:01:52.654 --> 00:01:54.448
It's a special edition!

4
00:01:55.073 --> 00:01:56.783
What a scary-looking wolf.

5
00:01:56.867 --> 00:01:59.661
You're right.
I missed the performance yesterday.

6
00:01:59.745 --> 00:02:01.705
-I went.
-Really?

7
00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:03.165
You did? How was it?

8
00:02:03.248 --> 00:02:05.917
It was crazy! They were hitting, kicking,
and at the end

9
00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:10.756
this wolf took out a machine gun
and the tiger turned into a fireball!

10
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.508
<i>Come on.</i>

11
00:02:13.592 --> 00:02:16.178
<i>The story is way too distorted.</i>

12
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.642
TWO SIDES TO THE STORY

13
00:02:21.725 --> 00:02:23.518
Here you go.

14
00:02:28.023 --> 00:02:31.234
-An egg sandwich and plain soy milk.
-Thanks.

15
00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:36.198
Legoshi.

16
00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:39.076
You're smart,
avoiding the cafeteria or the stall today.

17
00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.495
I thought so. What was it like?

18
00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:45.457
Your rampage yesterday
made the school newspaper's headlines.

19
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.667
They're selling fast.

20
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.670
-Headlines? No way.
-See for yourself.

21
00:02:50.253 --> 00:02:51.254
It's a nice photo.

22
00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:53.507
I bought it as a memento.

23
00:02:54.424 --> 00:02:57.052
It says "The Birth of A Dark Hero."

24
00:02:57.135 --> 00:03:00.347
<i>Jack must've seen</i>
<i>the performance yesterday,</i>

25
00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:05.936
<i>but he's spending time with me as usual.</i>

26
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.355
<i>Hasn't he noticed</i>

27
00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:13.568
<i>that my performance wasn't acting?</i>

28
00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:17.781
This photo really is great.

29
00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:21.201
Since when did you get
so close with Rouis?

30
00:03:21.284 --> 00:03:23.036
You got it wrong.

31
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.374
A lot of things happened after
to result in an article like this.

32
00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:31.253
In short, Rouis is the one
who should be praised.

33
00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:34.923
<i>I keep causing trouble.</i>

34
00:03:35.757 --> 00:03:37.759
<i>I'm too ashamed to face him.</i>

35
00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:42.222
I'm absolutely shocked by you two.

36
00:03:42.848 --> 00:03:45.267
You can wrestle here as much as you want.

37
00:03:45.976 --> 00:03:48.311
How do you intend to apologize
for all this?

38
00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:50.480
Well, I...

39
00:03:50.564 --> 00:03:54.025
I don't know where to start.

40
00:03:57.028 --> 00:04:01.158
Honestly, I don't care if you drank
animal blood to liven up.

41
00:04:01.825 --> 00:04:06.246
I never expected good morals from you,
unlike Legoshi.

42
00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:11.501
The problem is both of you.

43
00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:17.132
Two beasts went out of control
and smeared the stage with blood.

44
00:04:17.215 --> 00:04:19.926
Would you have killed each other
if I hadn't stopped you?

45
00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:24.389
Your barbarism is totally
beyond my understanding.

46
00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:30.979
The acting team has decided
to suspend both of you for a while.

47
00:04:31.646 --> 00:04:33.482
-No excuses.
-Rouis.

48
00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:35.400
We don't need you at rehearsal.

49
00:04:35.484 --> 00:04:37.944
-Behind you--
-To be honest, I can kick you out...

50
00:04:42.073 --> 00:04:43.950
Sorry to bother you.

51
00:04:44.034 --> 00:04:46.077
I'm from the PR team.

52
00:04:46.161 --> 00:04:50.624
I'd like to ask about today's performance.
Do you have some time?

53
00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:54.669
Rouis, what should we do?

54
00:04:54.753 --> 00:04:57.130
We'd love to hear about it, Rouis.

55
00:04:58.924 --> 00:05:02.010
<i>At that moment,</i>
<i>I saw Rouis showing his emotions</i>

56
00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:05.639
<i>like an ordinary 18-year-old does.</i>

57
00:05:07.098 --> 00:05:09.267
<i>But it might've been an illusion.</i>

58
00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:11.645
Listen up, you two.

59
00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:14.439
I'm taking back my words.

60
00:05:14.523 --> 00:05:16.525
The play was a success.

61
00:05:16.608 --> 00:05:19.611
I need you to act it out until the end.

62
00:05:19.694 --> 00:05:21.905
-Understand?
-Yes.

63
00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:25.867
Today's story was very different
from the first performance.

64
00:05:25.951 --> 00:05:27.911
Was it all scripted?

65
00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:32.791
Yes, of course. That was all planned out.

66
00:05:32.874 --> 00:05:37.045
I thought so. Everyone was so surprised.

67
00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:40.006
Can I ask more in detail?

68
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.174
Go ahead.

69
00:05:41.883 --> 00:05:44.970
This play was a big challenge for us,

70
00:05:45.554 --> 00:05:50.892
and a valuable performance
for the youngsters.

71
00:05:52.102 --> 00:05:55.438
We live in a very complicated world.

72
00:05:56.064 --> 00:05:58.984
Everyone has something to hide and endure.

73
00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:02.362
They live desperately
through various conflicts.

74
00:06:02.445 --> 00:06:04.322
There's no right or wrong.

75
00:06:04.823 --> 00:06:08.243
But if there's solid faith
within yourself,

76
00:06:08.326 --> 00:06:10.579
some light should shed upon you.

77
00:06:11.246 --> 00:06:13.832
Even if it's rough or childish,

78
00:06:13.915 --> 00:06:15.834
as long as there's faith...

79
00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:20.213
The actors have brilliantly
acted out this message.

80
00:06:20.797 --> 00:06:22.674
That's all from me.

81
00:06:22.757 --> 00:06:25.427
They will give you
the rest of the details.

82
00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:29.639
Rouis, hold on, please.
Give us another minute.

83
00:06:29.723 --> 00:06:33.226
<i>Was that a message for me?</i>

84
00:06:34.936 --> 00:06:38.773
<i>I ruined the stage.</i>
<i>Did my actions possess...</i>

85
00:06:40.025 --> 00:06:41.234
Faith.

86
00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:45.071
Legoshi.

87
00:06:45.155 --> 00:06:46.823
Has your anger settled?

88
00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:48.325
Anger?

89
00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:51.786
I mean, that scuffle on stage
wasn't acting.

90
00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:55.498
-How did you...
-Don't let it go to waste.

91
00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:58.668
There's no way I wouldn't notice.

92
00:06:59.544 --> 00:07:01.921
How long have we been friends?

93
00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:03.882
Here, three second rule.

94
00:07:04.466 --> 00:07:05.967
Just eat it.

95
00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:07.844
Cheer up already.

96
00:07:07.927 --> 00:07:09.888
You get depressed too easily.

97
00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:17.103
That's how I wanted to live.

98
00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:22.692
Get depressed and cheer up all by myself.

99
00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:24.986
I've always stayed unnoticed.

100
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.531
But yesterday, for the first time,
I didn't want that.

101
00:07:29.574 --> 00:07:31.534
I just wanted to vent my anger.

102
00:07:33.203 --> 00:07:35.205
I didn't want to control it.

103
00:07:36.748 --> 00:07:41.127
I mean, my feelings are my own, so...

104
00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.254
I can't explain it.

105
00:07:44.255 --> 00:07:46.299
<i>He's changed.</i>

106
00:07:47.008 --> 00:07:50.095
It's okay to feel like that sometimes.
You don't like it?

107
00:07:54.057 --> 00:07:57.310
I don't like the fact
that I don't mind it.

108
00:07:58.687 --> 00:08:00.397
Stop whining.

109
00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:03.274
No, I'm actually glad.

110
00:08:03.358 --> 00:08:05.777
You've never been
so lively before, Legoshi.

111
00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:08.738
-Really?
-You're fine.

112
00:08:09.948 --> 00:08:11.700
To be honest,

113
00:08:12.367 --> 00:08:16.788
you looked drained these days,
so I was worried.

114
00:08:16.871 --> 00:08:18.832
Were you inspired by something?

115
00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:20.709
Inspired...

116
00:08:22.836 --> 00:08:24.879
I don't know.

117
00:08:24.963 --> 00:08:26.506
For example...

118
00:08:27.549 --> 00:08:28.466
Love!

119
00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:32.637
<i>My tail is swinging, is this love?</i>

120
00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:35.557
<i>Legoshi...</i>

121
00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:40.437
Wait, really?

122
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.814
For 17 years, you weren't in love.

123
00:08:42.897 --> 00:08:44.524
And finally!

124
00:08:44.607 --> 00:08:45.942
We gotta get back to class.

125
00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:48.987
Who is it? Let's see.
Female wolves in our class...

126
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:50.155
That one and that...

127
00:08:50.238 --> 00:08:53.366
Four? I've narrowed it down quite a bit.

128
00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:57.078
-You're right. Oh, my.
-She's not a wolf? Is she a canine?

129
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.253
A SHOCKING PERFORMANCE

130
00:09:07.297 --> 00:09:09.007
You seem down.

131
00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:11.134
What's wrong?

132
00:09:11.718 --> 00:09:13.762
Things aren't going the way you want?

133
00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:22.312
Your beauty lies
in minding your own business.

134
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:24.564
Come here.

135
00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.954
STUDENT ID - NAME: JACK
CLASSIFICATION: GOLDEN RETRIEVER

136
00:09:42.791 --> 00:09:44.709
<i>The scent of soil is stronger.</i>

137
00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:47.045
<i>I like this smell.</i>

138
00:09:49.214 --> 00:09:52.884
It's the same every year,
mostly white and gray.

139
00:09:52.967 --> 00:09:55.470
I think it's mostly Legoshi's and my fur.

140
00:09:55.553 --> 00:09:59.140
But there's much more fur than last year.

141
00:09:59.224 --> 00:10:01.226
We'll sell it to the yarn shop again.

142
00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:03.561
I wonder how much it'll be.

143
00:10:03.645 --> 00:10:04.979
Share some with me, too.

144
00:10:05.522 --> 00:10:07.857
Where should we go for the summer?

145
00:10:07.941 --> 00:10:10.944
-I want to go somewhere far by train.
-That sounds good.

146
00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:13.238
I'm going to ask her out this year.

147
00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:15.990
Forget it. She's out of your league.

148
00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:18.952
Like last year,

149
00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:22.789
we're invited to participate
in the Festival of the Meteor again.

150
00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:24.666
FESTIVAL OF THE METEOR

151
00:10:24.749 --> 00:10:26.209
You'll participate, right?

152
00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:27.710
Hurray!

153
00:10:27.794 --> 00:10:32.173
We can go out to the city
without a permit again.

154
00:10:32.257 --> 00:10:34.551
Of course we'll do it!

155
00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:35.969
Hey, you guys.

156
00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:39.806
You're not going there to have fun.
You're helping out with the festival.

157
00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:41.474
Okay!

158
00:10:42.058 --> 00:10:44.853
The art team will be busy this year.

159
00:10:45.395 --> 00:10:47.313
Let's have a meeting at the warehouse.

160
00:10:47.897 --> 00:10:48.857
Okay.

161
00:10:49.983 --> 00:10:53.361
I guess we shouldn't reuse
last year's work.

162
00:10:53.444 --> 00:10:56.281
Why dinosaurs, anyway?

163
00:10:56.364 --> 00:10:58.241
There's got to be an easier animal.

164
00:10:58.324 --> 00:11:03.538
Dinosaurs are the ancestors of all animals
and treated as God.

165
00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:08.751
They say that when they were wiped out
by the meteor, it was summer.

166
00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:12.505
A festival to welcome
the ghosts of extinct dinosaurs?

167
00:11:12.589 --> 00:11:14.841
That's just a front.

168
00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:18.845
Everyone's just looking forward to
that lighting ceremony on the last day.

169
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:23.057
<i>They say that if a couple places</i>
<i>a lighted candle on a meteor,</i>

170
00:11:23.141 --> 00:11:24.851
<i>they'll be together forever.</i>

171
00:11:25.476 --> 00:11:27.353
<i>How can I put it?</i>

172
00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:30.481
It's an event for social animals.

173
00:11:30.565 --> 00:11:33.318
I'm sure all the actors will be busy
after the event,

174
00:11:33.401 --> 00:11:36.738
-partying with their lovers.
-Dancers, too.

175
00:11:36.821 --> 00:11:40.742
Let it be.
It means that they're relying on us.

176
00:11:40.825 --> 00:11:42.827
That's not what I'm saying.

177
00:11:42.911 --> 00:11:45.330
They might be relying on us

178
00:11:45.413 --> 00:11:48.541
because they think we have nothing else
to do on the day.

179
00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:51.794
Can't they understand our burden?

180
00:11:52.337 --> 00:11:55.298
We have one guy in the art team
who you don't want to piss off.

181
00:11:55.882 --> 00:11:57.467
It's rough.

182
00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:58.927
<i>He's talking about me.</i>

183
00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:02.138
<i>It's been a month since that incident,</i>

184
00:12:02.221 --> 00:12:06.517
<i>but I still act awkward around them.</i>

185
00:12:07.185 --> 00:12:11.356
Don't get us wrong.
We're not concerned about that anymore.

186
00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:12.649
How's your back?

187
00:12:13.232 --> 00:12:14.651
It's much better.

188
00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:16.653
That's good to know.

189
00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:18.613
Let's have dinner at the cafeteria.

190
00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:20.990
<i>I'm...</i>

191
00:12:26.329 --> 00:12:29.791
Sorry. I have to go somewhere.

192
00:12:29.874 --> 00:12:30.875
See you later.

193
00:12:33.211 --> 00:12:34.837
See you.

194
00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:37.256
He's such a weirdo.

195
00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:41.135
You probably made him feel uncomfortable.

196
00:12:41.219 --> 00:12:43.471
-Be nice.
-Okay.

197
00:12:46.849 --> 00:12:49.519
<i>These flowers don't look well.</i>

198
00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:52.355
<i>Who's taking care of this?</i>

199
00:12:53.272 --> 00:12:55.233
<i>If I change the water</i>

200
00:12:55.316 --> 00:12:58.486
<i>and give them some nutrients,</i>
<i>they should look better.</i>

201
00:12:59.988 --> 00:13:03.408
Don't worry. I'll revitalize you.

202
00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:11.290
You're so lame.

203
00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:15.378
<i>What a rookie mistake.</i>

204
00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:18.047
That dirty look suits you well.

205
00:13:18.715 --> 00:13:20.216
<i>How careless of me.</i>

206
00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:24.929
She only has flowers to talk to now.

207
00:13:26.597 --> 00:13:28.599
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

208
00:13:28.683 --> 00:13:32.353
<i>It's 100 times more fruitful</i>
<i>than talking to you.</i>

209
00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.233
It's been a while, Haru.

210
00:13:37.316 --> 00:13:38.943
We need to talk.

211
00:13:39.527 --> 00:13:42.989
What did you say
to my boyfriend this time?

212
00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:46.367
So you...

213
00:13:47.493 --> 00:13:49.537
failed to reconcile with you ex?

214
00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:50.997
What did you say?

215
00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.541
That's a pity, isn't it?

216
00:13:53.624 --> 00:13:55.877
He made a wise decision, though.

217
00:13:56.544 --> 00:13:58.629
Complain to your minions, not me.

218
00:13:59.505 --> 00:14:02.467
Whose fault do you think it is?

219
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:04.719
Because of a slut like you,

220
00:14:04.802 --> 00:14:08.139
Harlequin rabbits are further endangered.

221
00:14:08.222 --> 00:14:10.349
You're just a piece of garbage.

222
00:14:10.933 --> 00:14:14.270
You're worthless.
All you do is thwart my love.

223
00:14:15.938 --> 00:14:17.523
Oh, my.

224
00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:21.527
I have some advice for you poor soul.

225
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:24.489
You already lost.

226
00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:28.284
In the game of love, the more desperate
you are, the more you lose.

227
00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:30.995
You can keep fighting for nothing.

228
00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:34.290
I'll watch you from afar,
so, please, continue.

229
00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:39.670
I'll watch your stupid love grudge game
until you both become extinct.

230
00:14:39.754 --> 00:14:41.130
How entertaining!

231
00:14:41.214 --> 00:14:45.134
And I'll honor your spirits
as well as the dinosaurs' at the festival.

232
00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:48.054
You girls can never defeat me.

233
00:14:48.137 --> 00:14:51.265
Why don't you vent
on a punier female rabbit?

234
00:14:51.808 --> 00:14:54.018
I have nothing to lose.

235
00:14:54.102 --> 00:14:56.646
Unlike you, I have freedom.

236
00:15:04.237 --> 00:15:06.072
Did I go too far?

237
00:15:06.155 --> 00:15:07.907
Don't you underestimate me.

238
00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:10.910
Go get eaten alone!

239
00:15:13.037 --> 00:15:14.163
What?

240
00:15:17.834 --> 00:15:19.836
You're the guy from...

241
00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:22.422
<i>Wow...</i>

242
00:15:22.505 --> 00:15:24.048
<i>What should I do?</i>

243
00:15:24.132 --> 00:15:26.843
<i>She's finally in front of me.</i>

244
00:15:27.802 --> 00:15:30.930
<i>Are they bullying you? Are you hurt?</i>

245
00:15:31.013 --> 00:15:32.223
<i>Do you remember me?</i>

246
00:15:32.306 --> 00:15:34.934
-It's been a while.
<i>-I can't speak out loud.</i>

247
00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:41.023
<i>I've thought about you</i>
<i>so many times this past month.</i>

248
00:15:41.107 --> 00:15:42.608
The flowers...

249
00:15:42.692 --> 00:15:46.654
I hastened your death
because of my meddling.

250
00:15:46.737 --> 00:15:48.114
Sorry.

251
00:15:48.197 --> 00:15:51.784
<i>She's so much smaller than I remembered.</i>

252
00:15:57.874 --> 00:15:59.834
Are you all right?

253
00:16:04.422 --> 00:16:05.923
I appreciate your feelings,

254
00:16:06.424 --> 00:16:08.926
but I don't want mercy
from males I've slept with.

255
00:16:09.594 --> 00:16:10.470
Out of my way.

256
00:16:12.054 --> 00:16:14.599
No, we...

257
00:16:16.142 --> 00:16:18.603
We didn't do anything.

258
00:16:20.813 --> 00:16:21.772
Sorry.

259
00:16:23.107 --> 00:16:23.941
<i>That's right.</i>

260
00:16:24.901 --> 00:16:27.778
<i>I stripped and he ran away.</i>

261
00:16:28.404 --> 00:16:30.198
All that yelling made me hungry.

262
00:16:31.782 --> 00:16:34.202
Have you had dinner yet?

263
00:16:36.245 --> 00:16:38.372
Hey, look at that.

264
00:16:38.456 --> 00:16:40.750
Did he bring her here thinking she's food?

265
00:16:40.833 --> 00:16:43.419
The prey looks too dignified, though.

266
00:16:44.879 --> 00:16:46.422
Which one's getting punished?

267
00:16:51.469 --> 00:16:54.639
Sorry for sitting on your backpack.

268
00:16:54.722 --> 00:16:56.516
The height is perfect now.

269
00:16:57.391 --> 00:16:59.894
I see. That's good.

270
00:16:59.977 --> 00:17:01.687
<i>Oh, God!</i>

271
00:17:01.771 --> 00:17:03.981
<i>I'm repenting from the bottom of my heart.</i>

272
00:17:04.565 --> 00:17:07.026
<i>With everything that's happened recently,</i>

273
00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:10.780
<i>I thought I grew a bit, but I was wrong.</i>

274
00:17:11.447 --> 00:17:14.867
<i>I thought I started walking,</i>

275
00:17:14.951 --> 00:17:16.536
<i>but, in fact, I'm not moving.</i>

276
00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:18.037
<i>I was arrogant.</i>

277
00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:20.206
<i>I haven't changed.</i>

278
00:17:20.289 --> 00:17:21.624
<i>Because...</i>

279
00:17:22.291 --> 00:17:25.836
<i>I can't even ask a girl her name!</i>

280
00:17:26.921 --> 00:17:28.589
<i>How do you ask someone's name?</i>

281
00:17:28.673 --> 00:17:30.091
<i>Why do I want to know her name?</i>

282
00:17:30.174 --> 00:17:32.301
<i>Why would a wolf ask a rabbit's name?</i>

283
00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:33.928
<i>What's a name?</i>

284
00:17:34.011 --> 00:17:34.887
Hey.

285
00:17:35.471 --> 00:17:38.099
I don't know what happened, but cheer up.

286
00:17:38.849 --> 00:17:40.893
You won't grow if you don't eat.

287
00:17:41.852 --> 00:17:43.729
I will. Eat.

288
00:17:51.112 --> 00:17:52.655
Midterm's coming up.

289
00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:54.657
I suck at history.

290
00:17:55.658 --> 00:17:59.370
<i>Her voice sounds like a sad child.</i>

291
00:18:00.162 --> 00:18:01.789
<i>What an intriguing voice.</i>

292
00:18:02.832 --> 00:18:06.127
<i>Would she answer in that voice</i>
<i>if I ask her?</i>

293
00:18:06.877 --> 00:18:07.962
<i>"What's your name?"</i>

294
00:18:13.009 --> 00:18:15.803
<i>Wasn't that piece too big for you?</i>

295
00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:20.808
You're such a pervert.

296
00:18:22.101 --> 00:18:25.396
You shouldn't stare
at a girl eating like that.

297
00:18:26.188 --> 00:18:27.148
Sorry.

298
00:18:27.732 --> 00:18:28.983
I'm kidding.

299
00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:33.988
I wanted to thank you for the other day,
so I'm glad we could talk.

300
00:18:36.073 --> 00:18:40.828
I really was prepared
to get laid with a wolf.

301
00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:45.791
But instead, you put a blanket
on my shoulders and left.

302
00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:50.171
I think I was saved by your decision.

303
00:18:51.172 --> 00:18:52.506
Realistically speaking.

304
00:18:55.593 --> 00:18:57.261
<i>What do you mean?</i>

305
00:18:58.095 --> 00:19:01.057
<i>Well, I understand what you're saying,</i>

306
00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:04.185
<i>but I haven't even asked your name</i>

307
00:19:04.268 --> 00:19:06.354
<i>yet you seem to be distancing yourself.</i>

308
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:09.982
<i>Sorry, wolfie.</i>

309
00:19:12.068 --> 00:19:14.987
<i>This physical phenomenon...</i>

310
00:19:16.572 --> 00:19:18.491
<i>I guess it can't be helped.</i>

311
00:19:19.617 --> 00:19:23.954
<i>Every time he opens his mouth</i>
<i>and bares his fangs,</i>

312
00:19:24.747 --> 00:19:28.292
<i>my body tries to run away on instinct.</i>

313
00:19:28.376 --> 00:19:29.502
<i>Run away!</i>

314
00:19:29.585 --> 00:19:30.461
<i>Hurry!</i>

315
00:19:30.544 --> 00:19:32.713
<i>Gosh, this is unbearable.</i>

316
00:19:32.797 --> 00:19:36.759
<i>I didn't know eating with a wolf</i>
<i>was this risky.</i>

317
00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:38.511
<i>Hey, bunny.</i>

318
00:19:38.594 --> 00:19:41.180
<i>Does that mean you want</i>
<i>to stay away from me?</i>

319
00:19:41.806 --> 00:19:46.852
<i>I don't even know your name. I don't want</i>
<i>to know you only by your underwear.</i>

320
00:19:46.936 --> 00:19:49.814
<i>This wolf is probably a really nice guy</i>

321
00:19:49.897 --> 00:19:51.482
<i>and I want to be more friendly.</i>

322
00:19:52.149 --> 00:19:54.193
<i>But we're physically too different</i>

323
00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.987
<i>and I don't know how to fill that gap.</i>

324
00:19:58.364 --> 00:20:00.616
<i>It's best I keep a distance from him.</i>

325
00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.202
<i>Now? Should I ask her name?</i>

326
00:20:03.285 --> 00:20:04.704
<i>To close this distance...</i>

327
00:20:05.621 --> 00:20:07.957
-So...
-That was delicious!

328
00:20:08.666 --> 00:20:10.000
Thanks for hanging out.

329
00:20:10.084 --> 00:20:11.502
It was a rare experience.

330
00:20:13.879 --> 00:20:16.006
I'm going back to my room. How about you?

331
00:20:16.716 --> 00:20:17.758
I'll do the same.

332
00:20:24.223 --> 00:20:25.099
Hold on.

333
00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.270
Wait a minute.

334
00:20:33.441 --> 00:20:34.817
Do you need help?

335
00:20:38.154 --> 00:20:38.988
Here.

336
00:20:50.166 --> 00:20:51.876
<i>Our eyes met for the first time.</i>

337
00:20:53.711 --> 00:20:55.463
I didn't know rabbit eyes

338
00:20:56.338 --> 00:20:57.923
are pitch-black.

339
00:21:00.342 --> 00:21:01.594
What?

340
00:21:02.344 --> 00:21:04.138
I've never seen them closely.

341
00:21:04.722 --> 00:21:05.848
<i>That's right.</i>

342
00:21:05.931 --> 00:21:09.727
<i>I'm the one who didn't take</i>
<i>a sincere approach.</i>

343
00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:13.189
Plus, my name is not "rabbit."

344
00:21:13.272 --> 00:21:14.732
My name is Haru.

345
00:21:15.483 --> 00:21:16.358
What's yours?

346
00:21:18.027 --> 00:21:19.570
Legoshi.

347
00:21:21.655 --> 00:21:23.449
<i>I want you to smile more.</i>

348
00:21:23.532 --> 00:21:25.117
<i>I want to see more of you.</i>

349
00:21:26.494 --> 00:21:28.662
<i>From now on,</i>
<i>I don't care how dirty my tail gets.</i>

350
00:21:30.372 --> 00:21:32.291
<i>If I can look into your eyes.</i>

351
00:23:03.966 --> 00:23:05.968
