BLURRED VISION - DREAM OR REALITY?

2
00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:56.199
<i>Before dawn this morning, on Iguni Street,</i>

3
00:01:56.283 --> 00:02:00.579
<i>a group of carnivores attacked</i>
<i>a 22-year-old Thomson's gazelle, Linda,</i>

4
00:02:00.662 --> 00:02:03.540
<i>and killed her by biting her neck.</i>

5
00:02:03.624 --> 00:02:07.294
Well, there are lots of horrifying crimes
going on out there.

6
00:02:07.377 --> 00:02:10.464
<i>...suspects are still on the run.</i>
<i>According to the witness...</i>

7
00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:12.132
-This is not good.
<i>-...a gray wolf...</i>

8
00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:14.593
-I'll go back to the dorm.
<i>-...a coyote and Canidae...</i>

9
00:02:15.177 --> 00:02:17.137
You guys won the game.

10
00:02:18.055 --> 00:02:19.890
But you were winning...

11
00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:24.978
<i>As the Canidae is sociable</i>
<i>and highly bonded...</i>

12
00:02:25.062 --> 00:02:27.564
Don't worry. It's nothing unusual.

13
00:02:27.648 --> 00:02:30.776
DEVOURING CASE
SUSPECTS ON THE RUN

14
00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:34.905
<i>To be honest, we carnivores are used to</i>
<i>this kind of uncomfortable situation.</i>

15
00:02:36.907 --> 00:02:39.409
No! Let go of me!

16
00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:41.620
Look at the news!

17
00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:45.874
They say that the leader of the suspects
is a gray wolf.

18
00:02:46.458 --> 00:02:48.168
I'm not like them!

19
00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:51.463
-That's how everybody sees you!
<i>-They're not just teasing her.</i>

20
00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:53.715
<i>How would I help her?</i>

21
00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:55.801
<i>Hey, you!</i>

22
00:02:55.884 --> 00:02:58.136
<i>Well, this is complicated.</i>

23
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.139
<i>Maybe I shouldn't put my nose</i>
<i>into other people's business.</i>

24
00:03:01.223 --> 00:03:02.849
Are you listening to me?

25
00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:05.811
If you are one of them,
show me what you've got.

26
00:03:05.894 --> 00:03:08.021
Excuse me?

27
00:03:11.483 --> 00:03:13.151
I'm her brother.

28
00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:15.237
What is going on?

29
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.739
Her... brother?

30
00:03:17.823 --> 00:03:18.824
Yes.

31
00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:23.412
<i>Shoot! She doesn't look like me at all.</i>

32
00:03:23.495 --> 00:03:27.457
-Liar! She doesn't look like you at all.
-That's right!

33
00:03:27.541 --> 00:03:30.877
I look like our father
and she looks like our mother.

34
00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:33.964
Are you all right?

35
00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:39.803
Thanks, bro...

36
00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:42.681
Let's go.

37
00:03:48.687 --> 00:03:51.898
I'm sorry that I lied to them.

38
00:03:51.982 --> 00:03:53.734
No, you lied to save me.

39
00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:55.777
Thank you.

40
00:03:56.862 --> 00:03:59.865
I heard them say "gray wolf,"
so I just couldn't' leave you like that.

41
00:03:59.948 --> 00:04:02.826
Such news-related bullying is very common.

42
00:04:03.702 --> 00:04:05.454
You're a freshman, aren't you?

43
00:04:05.537 --> 00:04:08.081
You'll get used to it
by the time you become a junior...

44
00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:14.504
Is it something I have to get used to?

45
00:04:16.882 --> 00:04:19.092
It's more harsh than it was
in middle school.

46
00:04:19.176 --> 00:04:21.470
Why should I be treated like this?

47
00:04:22.304 --> 00:04:27.726
I'm frustrated with myself because
I let bullies hurt my feelings every time.

48
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.940
It's very important that
you get frustrated with these situations.

49
00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:40.155
Because I'm tired of being frustrated
and just pretending that I got used to it.

50
00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:42.824
You're frustrated because you're strong.

51
00:04:43.867 --> 00:04:45.702
Well, see you, then.

52
00:04:47.204 --> 00:04:49.748
You are Legoshi from the art team, right?

53
00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.755
I'm a new member.
I just joined the drama club this year.

54
00:04:56.838 --> 00:04:58.256
Is that right?

55
00:04:58.924 --> 00:05:00.258
I'm Juno.

56
00:05:00.342 --> 00:05:02.761
Sorry, I'm not familiar
with new members yet.

57
00:05:02.844 --> 00:05:05.764
Of course you're not,
because I'm on the actor team.

58
00:05:06.807 --> 00:05:12.270
I heard from Sheila on the first day
that there's a junior gray wolf.

59
00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.190
She told me that he was a nice wolf.

60
00:05:15.857 --> 00:05:17.859
She was right. I'm so happy to meet you.

61
00:05:17.943 --> 00:05:19.361
Oh, well...

62
00:05:19.444 --> 00:05:23.615
Since we are in the same species,
please talk to me casually.

63
00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:27.619
<i>Right, it's weird to be polite</i>
<i>to students younger than me.</i>

64
00:05:28.245 --> 00:05:30.497
Then, will you
attend the club this afternoon?

65
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.751
Well, no.
Only juniors will be attending today.

66
00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:41.216
As I've just said, those junior members
will visit the city hall to have a meeting

67
00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:45.095
about the Festival of the Meteor
tomorrow afternoon. Got it?

68
00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:47.180
Why did you only pick carnivores?

69
00:05:47.264 --> 00:05:49.599
We herbivores want to go out, too!

70
00:05:49.683 --> 00:05:51.560
Didn't you see the news?

71
00:05:51.643 --> 00:05:54.479
Herbivores' activities will be limited
to inside the school for a while.

72
00:05:54.563 --> 00:05:56.648
Okay, that's it, folks!

73
00:05:58.233 --> 00:06:00.485
You guys do know that

74
00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:04.197
carnivores can get out of control
when they lose all rational thinking.

75
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:06.866
There he goes again. I'm fed up with this.

76
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:07.909
One more thing.

77
00:06:08.493 --> 00:06:11.538
Don't even think about
stopping by the Black Market.

78
00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:18.295
Black... Market?

79
00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:25.677
Legoshi, you rarely go out, don't you?

80
00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:29.180
I've never been interested in out there.

81
00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:35.478
Aoba, have you been there...

82
00:06:35.562 --> 00:06:37.314
To the Black Market?

83
00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:43.445
No, but we carnivores
will eventually go there when we grow up.

84
00:06:59.377 --> 00:07:01.171
<i>Now I realized</i>

85
00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:04.841
<i>that I hadn't been outside of school</i>
<i>for a year.</i>

86
00:07:06.343 --> 00:07:08.053
How nice...

87
00:07:08.637 --> 00:07:10.805
All birds are flying.

88
00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:13.141
I wish I could fly, too.

89
00:07:13.224 --> 00:07:16.937
You can't have a flying license
until you graduate from school.

90
00:07:18.355 --> 00:07:19.522
<i>Well...</i>

91
00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:25.779
<i>Grown-ups are living in peace</i>
<i>better than I expected.</i>

92
00:07:27.489 --> 00:07:29.866
I thought you weren't interested
in the outside world.

93
00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:32.202
Your tail is wagging.

94
00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:34.329
Hey, come on! Let's go!

95
00:07:36.498 --> 00:07:39.918
<i>I should consider buying</i>
<i>a new pair of pants to cover my tail.</i>

96
00:07:41.252 --> 00:07:44.422
CITY HALL

97
00:07:44.506 --> 00:07:46.174
NOTICES REGARDING
THE FESTIVAL OF THE METEOR

98
00:07:46.257 --> 00:07:48.343
It's the same as last year.

99
00:07:48.426 --> 00:07:50.762
It was a good excuse
for us to go out anyways.

100
00:07:50.845 --> 00:07:53.932
-And what happened?
-Then she said,

101
00:07:54.015 --> 00:07:57.435
"You are so selfish in bed
that you make me feel so empty."

102
00:07:57.519 --> 00:08:00.271
And she started crying.
She doesn't make sense at all.

103
00:08:01.398 --> 00:08:03.817
But I love her striped ass.

104
00:08:04.734 --> 00:08:06.653
I don't want to break up with her.

105
00:08:06.736 --> 00:08:09.739
-So, the pattern is that important?
-Of course!

106
00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:13.159
So, when will you say goodbye
to your virginity?

107
00:08:13.243 --> 00:08:14.703
<i>How does he know that?</i>

108
00:08:14.786 --> 00:08:19.290
Let me tell ya, I can smell your virginity
from 100 miles away.

109
00:08:19.374 --> 00:08:22.043
Hey, there's a pretty gray wolf
who just joined our club.

110
00:08:22.711 --> 00:08:24.129
Are you talking about Juno?

111
00:08:24.796 --> 00:08:26.506
Hey, Legoshi knows her name.

112
00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:28.216
Hey, what about her?

113
00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:34.472
<i>I can't believe that we had a brutal fight</i>
<i>not long ago.</i>

114
00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:40.103
<i>Perhaps I will be able to live</i>
<i>more comfortably</i>

115
00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:43.189
<i>when I graduate from school</i>
<i>and become an adult.</i>

116
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.609
Wanna go back now?

117
00:08:47.277 --> 00:08:49.529
Yeah, the dorm matron will be mad.

118
00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:51.364
Which way is the station?

119
00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:53.575
We are lost.

120
00:08:55.618 --> 00:08:57.787
I just followed the zoozle map, though...

121
00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:00.999
If you're a bird,
why don't you use your magnetic sense?

122
00:09:01.082 --> 00:09:02.625
I'm not a migratory bird.

123
00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:04.586
We shouldn't be far from the station.

124
00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:14.512
Legoshi, what's wrong?

125
00:09:17.724 --> 00:09:21.019
Excuse me. May I ask for some help?

126
00:09:21.895 --> 00:09:23.938
Sure.

127
00:09:28.026 --> 00:09:30.945
Pick any finger you like.

128
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:36.159
<i>This smell is that of carnivores' sweat</i>
<i>and saliva.</i>

129
00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:40.747
These are just leftovers,
but it should taste the same.

130
00:09:44.042 --> 00:09:46.961
So, your canine is about one inch long.

131
00:09:47.045 --> 00:09:51.132
Since you are young and fit,
I'd have to ask you to pay more.

132
00:09:51.674 --> 00:09:54.219
Have it with just one bite, will you?

133
00:10:00.016 --> 00:10:01.935
This is the Black Market.

134
00:10:02.894 --> 00:10:06.523
Make sure to have it
with a single bite, will you?

135
00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:13.905
STUDENT ID - NAME: DOM
CLASSIFICATION: PEAFOWL

136
00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:18.118
Since we've gotten to know
each other's names,

137
00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:21.830
can I ask you something important?

138
00:10:22.497 --> 00:10:23.581
What is it?

139
00:10:24.124 --> 00:10:28.128
How do I look to you?

140
00:10:28.878 --> 00:10:30.755
How do I see you?

141
00:10:31.714 --> 00:10:33.925
Sorry to ask you such a nasty question.

142
00:10:34.008 --> 00:10:35.009
Give me your hand.

143
00:10:37.387 --> 00:10:41.432
I think... I just found out something.

144
00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:45.687
We'll become good friends.

145
00:10:47.897 --> 00:10:49.023
<i>Mister?</i>

146
00:10:50.024 --> 00:10:51.317
<i>Mister?</i>

147
00:10:52.068 --> 00:10:54.320
What are you spacing out about?

148
00:10:55.363 --> 00:10:56.239
Move!

149
00:10:57.323 --> 00:11:00.785
Hey, old man. You're selling your finger
for 70,000, right?

150
00:11:00.869 --> 00:11:04.205
Are you sure I can eat your finger
if I pay you 70,000?

151
00:11:04.289 --> 00:11:06.249
Hey, let's get a bite each!

152
00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:08.418
We can split the cost--

153
00:11:09.711 --> 00:11:11.004
What the hell?

154
00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:13.423
Cut it out! Have you lost your mind?

155
00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:15.717
You're the one who's lost your mind!

156
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.053
We are at the Black Market.
Why should I care about your ego?

157
00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:21.764
Legoshi, hold on.

158
00:11:22.473 --> 00:11:27.186
If we were at school, I'd be on your side,
but we are in a different situation.

159
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:28.479
-Aoba...
-Look around you.

160
00:11:29.856 --> 00:11:32.942
We are at the Black Market,
and we are carnivores.

161
00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:37.196
Will you eat his finger?

162
00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.575
You remember how people looked out there.

163
00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:43.244
They looked happy and peaceful.

164
00:11:43.328 --> 00:11:45.788
That is thanks to this Black Market.

165
00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:47.206
Don't you get it?

166
00:11:48.333 --> 00:11:50.293
Grow up already.

167
00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:54.088
<i>Those carnivores looked so calm.</i>

168
00:11:55.048 --> 00:11:57.926
<i>The reason behind</i>
<i>their calm behavior is...</i>

169
00:11:58.009 --> 00:11:59.469
Is that what it is?

170
00:12:02.013 --> 00:12:03.848
Is that what growing up means?

171
00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:08.811
Hey, Legoshi!

172
00:12:22.283 --> 00:12:24.410
<i>-Legoshi.</i>
<i>-What is it?</i>

173
00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.039
<i>How do I look to you?</i>

174
00:12:28.623 --> 00:12:31.042
<i>It's a weird question.</i>

175
00:12:39.384 --> 00:12:41.302
<i>I can't tell you this to your face,</i>

176
00:12:42.011 --> 00:12:44.013
<i>but you are a very attractive girl.</i>

177
00:12:44.722 --> 00:12:46.849
<i>I'm always thinking about you.</i>

178
00:12:47.684 --> 00:12:48.601
<i>In spite of that...</i>

179
00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:51.354
<i>In spite of thinking of you, why...</i>

180
00:12:52.188 --> 00:12:53.856
<i>Why can't I stop...</i>

181
00:12:55.024 --> 00:12:56.734
<i>drooling?</i>

182
00:12:58.403 --> 00:13:00.113
<i>What an ugly desire.</i>

183
00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:02.490
<i>I can't defeat anything.</i>

184
00:13:03.908 --> 00:13:08.121
<i>I don't have the right to blame Bill.</i>

185
00:13:09.038 --> 00:13:10.248
<i>Because I...</i>

186
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:12.542
<i>think of her as...</i>

187
00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:18.464
What a poor wolf.

188
00:13:18.548 --> 00:13:21.300
I'm glad that you passed out
in the back alley.

189
00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:40.445
<i>I seem to be in an emergency situation...</i>

190
00:13:41.863 --> 00:13:44.532
<i>Am I going to be killed?</i>

191
00:13:45.575 --> 00:13:47.326
Good morning.

192
00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:48.828
How do you feel?

193
00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:51.247
I bet you feel awful.

194
00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:03.301
Hey, you are much calmer than I expected.

195
00:14:03.384 --> 00:14:06.304
Your heart rate is normal
even in this situation.

196
00:14:07.722 --> 00:14:09.348
Don't get naughty.

197
00:14:10.725 --> 00:14:12.351
What's all this? Where am I?

198
00:14:13.478 --> 00:14:15.354
Let me be clear.

199
00:14:15.938 --> 00:14:19.984
You're not supposed to be hostile to me.

200
00:14:26.282 --> 00:14:28.284
I watch over the Black Market.

201
00:14:29.827 --> 00:14:31.579
Let me ask you something.

202
00:14:31.662 --> 00:14:32.830
What is your name?

203
00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:37.919
-Legoshi.
-Legoshi?

204
00:14:38.503 --> 00:14:40.963
When did you devour a herbivore?

205
00:14:41.047 --> 00:14:41.881
Never!

206
00:14:43.257 --> 00:14:47.303
If a carnivore is found passed out
or panicked at the Black Market,

207
00:14:47.387 --> 00:14:50.306
that means he's eaten
a herbivore for sure.

208
00:14:52.892 --> 00:14:56.104
I almost did, but I came
to my senses at the last second.

209
00:14:56.187 --> 00:14:59.399
Or more precisely, you put a mask on again
to hide your real intention.

210
00:14:59.982 --> 00:15:03.152
But I'm going to tell her the truth
someday...

211
00:15:03.236 --> 00:15:04.779
"Her"?

212
00:15:04.862 --> 00:15:07.740
Are you getting along with her
after you tried to eat her?

213
00:15:08.825 --> 00:15:11.953
What are you thinking
when you communicate with her?

214
00:15:12.036 --> 00:15:14.789
Do you talk to her
while imagining what she tastes like?

215
00:15:14.872 --> 00:15:18.042
Are you waiting for a chance
to eat her every day?

216
00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:20.545
-I'm offended.
-I bet you are.

217
00:15:20.628 --> 00:15:21.838
No matter what they say,

218
00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:26.426
all carnivores have the same desires
under their sheep's clothing.

219
00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:29.303
That is why the Black Market exists.

220
00:15:31.264 --> 00:15:33.349
The meat sold at the Black Market

221
00:15:33.433 --> 00:15:37.728
secretly comes from hospitals
and funeral homes.

222
00:15:38.479 --> 00:15:40.565
It's still illegal,

223
00:15:40.648 --> 00:15:43.317
but we don't have to kill them
with our own hands, at least.

224
00:15:44.193 --> 00:15:46.195
Look at this.

225
00:15:46.904 --> 00:15:52.034
These are carnivores who gave in to their
feral instincts and killed herbivores.

226
00:15:53.703 --> 00:15:58.749
Some couldn't forget the taste of meat
and ate their own arms.

227
00:15:58.833 --> 00:16:01.627
Some have lost their fur from stress.

228
00:16:01.711 --> 00:16:04.672
Some hated themselves for
what they've done and self-harmed.

229
00:16:06.174 --> 00:16:09.635
One of them was even
so much in love with a herbivore

230
00:16:09.719 --> 00:16:11.512
that he eventually devoured her.

231
00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:15.391
Who are you?

232
00:16:20.021 --> 00:16:24.108
I'm a psychotherapist of the Black Market.

233
00:16:24.692 --> 00:16:26.360
I'm actually a real doctor.

234
00:16:29.197 --> 00:16:33.201
I have to keep working hard
not to add any more photos.

235
00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.579
Whether I become your enemy or ally,

236
00:16:37.538 --> 00:16:38.998
it's all up to you.

237
00:16:43.628 --> 00:16:47.965
So you are a student
of that famous Cherryton School.

238
00:16:49.091 --> 00:16:50.218
What?

239
00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:52.970
What's that "I'm so miserable" look?

240
00:16:53.054 --> 00:16:54.639
You're such a pain.

241
00:16:55.431 --> 00:16:57.099
<i>He was really strong.</i>

242
00:16:58.267 --> 00:16:59.977
<i>He is a mammal, an Ursidae.</i>

243
00:17:00.061 --> 00:17:02.939
<i>Their size and nature is similar</i>
<i>to that of brown bears,</i>

244
00:17:03.022 --> 00:17:04.982
<i>but they have one unique trait.</i>

245
00:17:05.691 --> 00:17:09.028
<i>Pandas are carnivores,</i>
<i>but can live by only eating plants.</i>

246
00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:15.493
How do you practice psychotherapy?

247
00:17:16.827 --> 00:17:18.746
As a panda with a strong body?

248
00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:21.874
Or as a panda who never eats meat at all?

249
00:17:23.042 --> 00:17:25.086
You're such a typical honor student.

250
00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.673
<i>I've already gotten rid</i>
<i>of my instincts as a beast.</i>

251
00:17:29.257 --> 00:17:31.634
<i>It's been more than ten years</i>
<i>since I decided to live here</i>

252
00:17:31.717 --> 00:17:33.803
<i>when I realized this town needed a doctor.</i>

253
00:17:33.886 --> 00:17:35.638
<i>While I've been nearly killed many times,</i>

254
00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:38.224
<i>I've only been able to heal</i>
<i>a handful of carnivores.</i>

255
00:17:39.058 --> 00:17:41.561
To help more people and protect myself,

256
00:17:41.644 --> 00:17:44.605
I've been eating bamboo
and building up my body to get stronger.

257
00:17:46.315 --> 00:17:47.233
I'm...

258
00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:51.988
nobody but a doctor with big muscles.

259
00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:57.535
<i>He must be telling me the truth.</i>

260
00:18:01.872 --> 00:18:02.873
You like it?

261
00:18:03.583 --> 00:18:05.585
It's a bamboo tea.

262
00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:09.922
So, when you have
dangerous carnivores in custody,

263
00:18:10.006 --> 00:18:11.966
how do you treat them?

264
00:18:12.049 --> 00:18:13.217
"Treat"?

265
00:18:13.301 --> 00:18:15.428
That's what I'm doing right now.

266
00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:18.014
The carrot-and-stick counseling.

267
00:18:18.598 --> 00:18:19.890
I'm not your patient!

268
00:18:19.974 --> 00:18:21.767
My patients always say so.

269
00:18:21.851 --> 00:18:24.145
At least I'm trying
to overcome my problems.

270
00:18:24.228 --> 00:18:26.897
-That's also what they say.
-You know nothing about me!

271
00:18:26.981 --> 00:18:30.484
I've become her friend,
gradually, though. And--

272
00:18:30.568 --> 00:18:31.736
Shut up, brat!

273
00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:35.865
Stop barking like a chihuahua!
Listen to me!

274
00:18:37.033 --> 00:18:40.161
I know you want to get along with her,

275
00:18:40.953 --> 00:18:44.707
but just your reason wants it.

276
00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:48.169
It's a camouflage for your desire
to rip through her meat

277
00:18:48.252 --> 00:18:49.545
<i>and devour it.</i>

278
00:18:50.171 --> 00:18:53.758
Look, what you have on your mind is

279
00:18:53.841 --> 00:18:57.053
just your twisted hunting instincts
turned into romantic feelings.

280
00:18:57.136 --> 00:18:59.472
<i>Those are actually the worst feelings.</i>

281
00:19:00.431 --> 00:19:02.308
<i>You should break off</i>
<i>a relationship with her</i>

282
00:19:02.975 --> 00:19:04.810
before it's too late.

283
00:19:10.399 --> 00:19:11.484
Damn.

284
00:19:12.151 --> 00:19:14.487
This is why I don't like teenagers.

285
00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:17.531
All you think about is love.

286
00:19:18.532 --> 00:19:21.786
I'm not really sure
if what I'm feeling is love.

287
00:19:21.869 --> 00:19:24.580
I've never had a relationship with anyone,
so I can't tell...

288
00:19:25.122 --> 00:19:26.332
Never?

289
00:19:26.415 --> 00:19:28.709
May I go back to school now?

290
00:19:28.793 --> 00:19:30.670
Thank you for your hospitality.

291
00:19:31.253 --> 00:19:33.589
<i>-More like hostility, though.</i>
-Hey!

292
00:19:35.716 --> 00:19:37.259
Use this and see how it works.

293
00:19:37.343 --> 00:19:38.678
WILDKICK
WET RABBITS

294
00:19:38.761 --> 00:19:40.763
Well, I'm serious.

295
00:19:41.555 --> 00:19:43.641
If you get stimulated with this porn,

296
00:19:43.724 --> 00:19:47.103
then that means you simply have
a unique sexuality.

297
00:19:48.312 --> 00:19:50.481
<i>If you don't get stimulated with this</i>

298
00:19:50.564 --> 00:19:53.442
<i>but you are attracted to a rabbit,</i>
<i>then that sounds serious.</i>

299
00:19:53.526 --> 00:19:55.486
PANDA

300
00:19:57.905 --> 00:20:01.075
<i>"Check yourself, no need to return it"?</i>

301
00:20:01.659 --> 00:20:03.160
<i>I hate this!</i>

302
00:20:08.499 --> 00:20:12.503
<i>What I saw, what I heard today,</i>
<i>I want to erase it all from my memory!</i>

303
00:20:13.587 --> 00:20:17.299
<i>I just wanna forget about the whole thing!</i>

304
00:20:23.055 --> 00:20:23.973
Legoshi.

305
00:20:25.015 --> 00:20:26.058
Legoshi.

306
00:20:26.934 --> 00:20:28.769
Aoba, what are you doing here?

307
00:20:30.813 --> 00:20:32.314
I ran away from there.

308
00:20:33.315 --> 00:20:37.236
I couldn't eat the old man's finger.

309
00:20:39.822 --> 00:20:44.744
When I thought about my herbivore friends
like Sanu and Rouis,

310
00:20:45.327 --> 00:20:47.997
it made me feel so queasy.

311
00:20:49.832 --> 00:20:51.417
<i>Aoba...</i>

312
00:20:52.418 --> 00:20:53.836
<i>Even at a moment like this,</i>

313
00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:58.758
<i>your beak as a carnivore looks</i>
<i>so sharp and beautiful.</i>

314
00:21:05.181 --> 00:21:08.726
So, I'm sorry about earlier.

315
00:21:08.809 --> 00:21:09.769
Let's go back...

316
00:21:13.272 --> 00:21:14.982
Legoshi, are you cry...

317
00:21:15.858 --> 00:21:17.777
I don't have a towel.

318
00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:18.778
You okay?

319
00:21:19.695 --> 00:21:21.155
<i>I want to stand on my own feet.</i>

320
00:21:21.906 --> 00:21:25.451
<i>On my own two feet, with claws,</i>
<i>in this world.</i>

321
00:21:26.076 --> 00:21:27.703
<i>All I and Aoba want is...</i>

322
00:21:28.621 --> 00:21:31.999
<i>to stand on our own feet.</i>

323
00:23:03.966 --> 00:23:05.968
