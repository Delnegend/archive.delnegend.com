1
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.777
Turn it on!

2
00:01:54.323 --> 00:01:55.365
That's awesome!

3
00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:58.285
Have you asked a girl
to the lighting ceremony yet?

4
00:01:58.368 --> 00:02:01.538
-Come on, tell me.
-Huh? What about you?

5
00:02:02.247 --> 00:02:04.207
Did he have a fight with Juno?

6
00:02:07.252 --> 00:02:09.046
He's so obvious.

7
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.423
Listen, guys.

8
00:02:11.506 --> 00:02:14.217
Let's stop here for today
and go back to school.

9
00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:16.303
-What?
-It's only five.

10
00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:18.096
The mayor told us to leave.

11
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.099
Could that be because of
what happened yesterday?

12
00:02:21.183 --> 00:02:22.434
That's right.

13
00:02:22.517 --> 00:02:25.604
There have been many devouring incidents,
so it's not safe for us to stay out late.

14
00:02:25.687 --> 00:02:27.397
I heard a duck was killed
in the neighboring town.

15
00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:30.275
That's why we're going back to school
before it gets dark.

16
00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:31.568
Okay.

17
00:02:34.237 --> 00:02:37.032
I wonder if the Festival of the Meteor
will really be held.

18
00:02:37.115 --> 00:02:38.283
Let's go.

19
00:02:38.367 --> 00:02:43.288
CAUGHT LIKE FLOSS IN A CANINE'S TOOTH

20
00:02:43.372 --> 00:02:45.290
FLOWER

21
00:02:51.922 --> 00:02:54.424
You must be a student
from Cherryton School.

22
00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:56.676
Mr. Mayor...

23
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.054
You have to go back to school now.

24
00:02:59.137 --> 00:03:00.222
Yes.

25
00:03:00.305 --> 00:03:03.975
Creating a town
where everybody can live in safety

26
00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:06.561
is my duty as a mayor.

27
00:03:12.526 --> 00:03:15.570
Everybody's already left.
I didn't realize that.

28
00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:23.578
<i>I'm so alone.</i>

29
00:03:24.287 --> 00:03:26.123
<i>Well, I've always been alone.</i>

30
00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:30.085
<i>Even if I get devoured, no one would</i>
<i>probably notice that I'm gone.</i>

31
00:03:33.171 --> 00:03:35.632
Haru...

32
00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:38.176
Legoshi.

33
00:03:39.136 --> 00:03:41.972
<i>It's really hard to understand</i>
<i>this gray wolf boy.</i>

34
00:03:42.723 --> 00:03:44.933
<i>He turned the cold shoulder to me</i>
<i>the other day,</i>

35
00:03:45.016 --> 00:03:46.727
<i>-and now he shows this verve.</i>
-Ah...

36
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.438
<i>Shoot! I should talk to her</i>
<i>at her eye level.</i>

37
00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:53.525
-How are you?
-I thought you'd already left.

38
00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:55.736
Yeah...

39
00:03:57.028 --> 00:04:00.741
Ah... Can I go home with you today?

40
00:04:01.825 --> 00:04:04.661
Sure, but what happened all of a sudden?

41
00:04:05.287 --> 00:04:08.707
Because it's dangerous outside.

42
00:04:20.802 --> 00:04:22.846
<i>Was he actually trying to be funny?</i>

43
00:04:23.472 --> 00:04:27.309
<i>I wonder if I should have joked about it</i>
<i>like, "Look who's talking!"</i>

44
00:04:29.728 --> 00:04:33.148
<i>Hey, what the hell is wrong with you,</i>
<i>Legoshi?</i>

45
00:04:40.989 --> 00:04:43.033
Sorry, sorry.

46
00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:46.536
<i>Stand clear of the closing doors, please.</i>

47
00:04:53.543 --> 00:04:54.795
Sorry...

48
00:05:00.592 --> 00:05:02.135
Legoshi...

49
00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:04.888
I felt this when I met you
for the first time...

50
00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:07.641
I don't really know what you're thinking.

51
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:09.684
You don't?

52
00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:12.729
<i>The first day...</i>

53
00:05:18.235 --> 00:05:20.111
It was hot today, wasn't it?

54
00:05:20.195 --> 00:05:22.155
It's gonna be a little cooler tomorrow,

55
00:05:22.239 --> 00:05:26.493
-so it'll be more comfort--
-Why do you avoid talking about that day?

56
00:05:27.202 --> 00:05:29.913
You can laugh at it now
that a rabbit you just met

57
00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:32.958
tried to sleep with you,
because we are friends now, right?

58
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.045
I can't just let it go that easily.

59
00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:41.341
It was something
unforgettable to me, so...

60
00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:44.135
I can't do anything but just keep inside

61
00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:45.887
my heart, and I don't want to
forget about it.

62
00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:50.308
I want you to value yourself
as much as I value that memory.

63
00:05:50.392 --> 00:05:55.146
Please don't... give yourself
to anyone like that.

64
00:05:57.857 --> 00:06:01.736
I don't want to hear that,
especially from a wolf like you.

65
00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:07.450
DO NOT ENTER

66
00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:12.872
You've never known what it's like
to live a life

67
00:06:13.707 --> 00:06:15.458
with the constant fear of death.

68
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.878
I may be devoured

69
00:06:19.504 --> 00:06:22.257
before even being loved by someone.

70
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.718
You've never had such a fear,

71
00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:26.928
so you will never understand
that about me.

72
00:06:29.431 --> 00:06:31.600
Let go of me.
I'll ride in other train car.

73
00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:35.687
-You can't. We should talk.
-We have nothing to talk about.

74
00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.772
-I just told you the truth.
-But--

75
00:06:37.856 --> 00:06:41.026
Stop lecturing me as if you understand me.
Let go of my hand!

76
00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:42.736
Then, don't go away.

77
00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:45.155
-What the hell? Just let me go!
-No!

78
00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:47.032
-Let go of me!
-I won't.

79
00:06:47.616 --> 00:06:50.785
-He's assaulting her!
-Is there any carnivore who can help?

80
00:06:52.787 --> 00:06:54.831
You, the wolf!

81
00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:55.999
What are you doing?

82
00:06:56.708 --> 00:07:00.045
I was just talking with her.
I wasn't doing anything...

83
00:07:00.128 --> 00:07:01.588
Let's get out of here!

84
00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:03.798
-What? Why?
-Now!

85
00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:05.925
Hey, wait!

86
00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:08.428
Why are we running away?
They'll be more suspicious...

87
00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:09.512
Are you stupid?

88
00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:12.599
Carnivores could get caught
just by using any kind of force

89
00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:13.933
on herbivores these days.

90
00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:18.313
-Oh, I almost kicked you.
-You're such a pain!

91
00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:20.815
Are you sensitive or thick-skinned?
Make up your mind!

92
00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:24.736
I'm still trying
to figure that out myself.

93
00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:29.115
Because we are so different, I'm wondering
how I should interact with you.

94
00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:32.327
Will you stop being attentive to me
in a situation like this?

95
00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.704
Instead, just run as fast as you can
and take me away!

96
00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:37.165
Or they'll get you! Hurry!

97
00:07:37.248 --> 00:07:39.417
Hey! Stop right there!

98
00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:49.052
<i>In front of the girl I fell in love with</i>
<i>for the first time,</i>

99
00:07:49.928 --> 00:07:53.181
<i>I could feel confident about myself</i>
<i>as a wolf for the first time.</i>

100
00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:56.726
<i>I have no idea where I'm heading to.</i>

101
00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.187
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what others think about us, either.</i>

102
00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:01.439
<i>There should be a way.</i>

103
00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:05.819
<i>I'm just gonna keep moving forward.</i>

104
00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:12.325
Where are they?

105
00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:25.422
<i>Even in this kind of situation,</i>
<i>he's trying not to touch me.</i>

106
00:08:28.758 --> 00:08:32.512
-Hey, over there!
-What? Really?

107
00:08:33.096 --> 00:08:34.514
I thought they were here...

108
00:08:38.226 --> 00:08:39.269
Hey...

109
00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:40.979
Can we go now?

110
00:08:42.689 --> 00:08:46.026
Haru...
Do you fear like your life is in danger

111
00:08:47.068 --> 00:08:50.572
by being with me here, right now?

112
00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:55.076
<i>I didn't notice until now,</i>

113
00:08:55.744 --> 00:08:59.581
<i>that carnivores growl in the throat</i>

114
00:08:59.664 --> 00:09:02.000
<i>as they talk.</i>

115
00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:05.045
<i>Why are you letting out</i>

116
00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:07.547
<i>such a low growl with such a gentle look?</i>

117
00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:10.258
I told you!

118
00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:14.345
Be sensitive or be thick-skinned.
Not both.

119
00:09:14.429 --> 00:09:15.764
Because you ask such a question
in anervous tone,

120
00:09:15.847 --> 00:09:17.098
everybody gets scared of you.

121
00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:22.353
I read about it in a magazine,

122
00:09:22.437 --> 00:09:25.315
carnivores can never be too cheerful
if you wanna be popular.

123
00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:26.775
You know what that means?

124
00:09:26.858 --> 00:09:27.859
Yeah, I get it.

125
00:09:29.486 --> 00:09:32.280
<i>It's wrong to keep it a secret anymore.</i>

126
00:09:32.947 --> 00:09:35.241
<i>I have to tell her about that night.</i>

127
00:09:35.325 --> 00:09:38.453
<i>Maybe now is the time to confess.</i>

128
00:09:40.622 --> 00:09:41.664
-Look...
-Listen--

129
00:09:42.332 --> 00:09:46.753
...I was once almost devoured
by a carnivore.

130
00:09:48.213 --> 00:09:52.592
At school. I couldn't see his face though,
because it was too dark.

131
00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:55.678
Look at this scar.

132
00:09:58.973 --> 00:10:02.393
Remember? I had a bandage
when I met you for the first time.

133
00:10:02.477 --> 00:10:04.229
<i>That's...</i>

134
00:10:04.312 --> 00:10:07.107
<i>I told you that I didn't remember</i>
<i>what happened,</i>

135
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:08.191
<i>but I was lying.</i>

136
00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:10.068
<i>...a scar I gave you.</i>

137
00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:12.487
<i>I can't tell her.</i>

138
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.072
I'm glad that I wasn't killed.

139
00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:18.451
I don't feel the fear of death
when I hang out with you.

140
00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.370
I can swear this.

141
00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:22.997
Hey, smile!

142
00:10:23.081 --> 00:10:26.459
-Hey, come on! Give me your smile!
<i>-I can't tell her now...</i>

143
00:10:28.002 --> 00:10:29.629
<i>If I tell her my secret,</i>

144
00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.507
<i>we'll probably be over.</i>

145
00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:36.928
<i>Until the time comes,</i>
<i>I will keep admonishing myself.</i>

146
00:10:38.138 --> 00:10:40.014
-Haru...
-What?

147
00:10:40.682 --> 00:10:42.600
Thank you...

148
00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:45.061
for today.

149
00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:51.943
You don't have to thank me,
but just be happy. Smile!

150
00:10:53.278 --> 00:10:54.445
Smile...

151
00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:58.199
Oh, come on! You're making a fake smile
on purpose, aren't you?

152
00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:03.204
<i>Can I walk with you in the sunlight</i>
<i>a bit longer?</i>

153
00:11:17.802 --> 00:11:20.930
STUDENT ID - NAME: JUNO
CLASSIFICATION: GRAY WOLF

154
00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:22.473
For real?

155
00:11:27.395 --> 00:11:29.355
I heard that Bill did that to you.

156
00:11:30.982 --> 00:11:34.110
I hope it doesn't leave a scar.

157
00:11:34.193 --> 00:11:36.696
This isn't the same
as the scar on your back.

158
00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:38.072
What do you want?

159
00:11:38.156 --> 00:11:40.366
If you have something to say, say it.

160
00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.869
I have nothing to say... for now.

161
00:11:43.661 --> 00:11:46.497
Hey, what's wrong with them?

162
00:11:46.581 --> 00:11:47.832
What's going on?

163
00:11:47.916 --> 00:11:50.668
Are they getting along or not?

164
00:11:50.752 --> 00:11:52.378
They're not.

165
00:11:52.462 --> 00:11:55.006
Don't bring your personal problems
into the club.

166
00:11:56.883 --> 00:12:00.678
I'm telling this to all of you!
The Festival of the Meteor is approaching,

167
00:12:00.762 --> 00:12:03.723
but we are not working as a team at all.

168
00:12:03.806 --> 00:12:07.685
Will you guys be able to perform perfectly
without any mistakes?

169
00:12:10.021 --> 00:12:11.439
I'm sorry!

170
00:12:13.775 --> 00:12:14.901
I'm late.

171
00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:16.903
Juno!

172
00:12:16.986 --> 00:12:19.113
Juno! If you're gonna be late,

173
00:12:19.197 --> 00:12:22.033
you have to let me or
one of the seniors know.

174
00:12:22.116 --> 00:12:23.701
I'm sorry.

175
00:12:23.785 --> 00:12:26.371
My classmate, a sloth,
had to rush to the bathroom,

176
00:12:26.454 --> 00:12:27.664
so I carried her there.

177
00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:30.375
-It can't be helped, then.
-You are so kind.

178
00:12:31.209 --> 00:12:33.294
But it's just an excuse,

179
00:12:33.378 --> 00:12:36.589
so please let me do the cleaning
of the rehearsal room today.

180
00:12:36.673 --> 00:12:38.967
Sheila, what's going on?

181
00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:41.719
You told me that Juno was isolated
from the other members.

182
00:12:43.346 --> 00:12:46.182
She's been making a lot of efforts
these days.

183
00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:50.061
Legoshi!

184
00:12:50.937 --> 00:12:52.855
I saw the dino!

185
00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:54.983
Because the art team does a great job,

186
00:12:55.066 --> 00:12:57.735
we, the actors, can do our best dancing.

187
00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:00.989
That's great.

188
00:13:01.072 --> 00:13:03.616
She's looking at nobody but Legoshi.

189
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.744
The Festival of the Meteor
is the biggest summer event.

190
00:13:06.828 --> 00:13:09.288
Let's do our best on our practice today!

191
00:13:09.372 --> 00:13:10.623
Yeah!

192
00:13:10.707 --> 00:13:12.625
Okay, let's warm up!

193
00:13:12.709 --> 00:13:15.336
<i>Juno pulled a team together.</i>

194
00:13:27.181 --> 00:13:28.516
Juno.

195
00:13:29.892 --> 00:13:31.227
Thank you for today.

196
00:13:31.936 --> 00:13:33.438
Aren't you done cleaning yet?

197
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.024
Isn't it too dark with just one light on?

198
00:13:36.107 --> 00:13:38.067
Because wolves are nocturnal,

199
00:13:38.151 --> 00:13:40.069
I feel better when it's dark.

200
00:13:41.237 --> 00:13:42.071
Right...

201
00:13:42.864 --> 00:13:44.866
You're a wolf.

202
00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:47.577
That's not the only reason.

203
00:13:48.244 --> 00:13:50.288
There's one spotlight,

204
00:13:50.371 --> 00:13:51.998
and there are two actors.

205
00:13:52.707 --> 00:13:56.377
Rouis, would you help me with my practice?

206
00:13:58.796 --> 00:14:01.424
<i>Just two of us, for the first time.</i>

207
00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:03.718
Okay.

208
00:14:05.053 --> 00:14:08.681
One, two, three. One, two, three.

209
00:14:08.765 --> 00:14:10.850
One, two, three.

210
00:14:18.191 --> 00:14:19.650
You're doing it the wrong way.

211
00:14:20.735 --> 00:14:22.153
Did I go too fast?

212
00:14:22.236 --> 00:14:24.113
It was rather rough.

213
00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:27.450
Your performance
would fascinate the audience,

214
00:14:27.533 --> 00:14:29.452
but the harmony with others is important.

215
00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:31.454
Give me your hand.

216
00:14:31.537 --> 00:14:34.957
Well, as long as you cheerfully dance,

217
00:14:35.041 --> 00:14:36.918
guys will be fascinated.

218
00:14:37.001 --> 00:14:39.379
So you really don't need
to pursue perfection.

219
00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:42.799
What do you mean by that?

220
00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:44.300
Oh, sorry.

221
00:14:45.134 --> 00:14:46.803
Did that sound like an insult?

222
00:14:48.805 --> 00:14:50.139
I realize...

223
00:14:53.142 --> 00:14:53.976
Hey...

224
00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:57.480
...that you hate me.

225
00:14:59.941 --> 00:15:01.275
Or perhaps,

226
00:15:01.359 --> 00:15:03.444
you just hate carnivores.

227
00:15:05.113 --> 00:15:06.697
What do you think you're doing?

228
00:15:07.365 --> 00:15:09.033
Are you going to kiss me or what?

229
00:15:09.617 --> 00:15:12.245
Of course not.

230
00:15:12.995 --> 00:15:16.332
If I kissed you on the lips now,

231
00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:19.544
and if I couldn't resist
my impulse to eat you,

232
00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:22.463
I'd be in trouble.

233
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:28.636
I'm not into you.
I'm in love with Legoshi.

234
00:15:30.138 --> 00:15:34.517
I am declaring a war, Rouis.

235
00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:38.020
I will be the next Beastar.

236
00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:41.983
I will make a new peaceful era
for carnivores

237
00:15:42.733 --> 00:15:44.986
and Legoshi senpai will be mine.

238
00:15:50.283 --> 00:15:52.952
Do you still want to boast
about your strength?

239
00:15:53.911 --> 00:15:56.330
I'd probably feel better
being devoured by you

240
00:15:56.414 --> 00:15:59.500
rather than Bill or Legoshi.

241
00:16:01.127 --> 00:16:03.129
I will...

242
00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:09.343
never bare my fangs against you.

243
00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:12.263
Female wolves do not like conflict.

244
00:16:12.346 --> 00:16:13.848
Really?

245
00:16:13.931 --> 00:16:17.477
A greedy female wolf like you
must be different from others.

246
00:16:19.228 --> 00:16:21.272
Is it wrong to be greedy?

247
00:16:22.064 --> 00:16:23.316
No, I didn't mean that.

248
00:16:24.192 --> 00:16:25.568
Just...

249
00:16:25.651 --> 00:16:30.198
Your greediness is based on
your massive confidence.

250
00:16:30.907 --> 00:16:33.659
Beauty, status, and a male.

251
00:16:34.577 --> 00:16:37.079
You think you can get whatever you wish.

252
00:16:37.705 --> 00:16:39.832
You already have the first one, beauty,

253
00:16:40.458 --> 00:16:42.585
but I will not let you have
the second one.

254
00:16:43.794 --> 00:16:47.256
And the third one.
Your favorite male, Legoshi...

255
00:16:51.802 --> 00:16:55.640
He is much harder to obtain
than you think.

256
00:16:58.142 --> 00:17:00.102
What makes you say that?

257
00:17:00.186 --> 00:17:02.855
I will definitely make Legoshi mine!

258
00:17:03.481 --> 00:17:07.318
Just watch him,
and you will see what I mean.

259
00:17:08.236 --> 00:17:12.406
Well, it will be a good ordeal
for an overconfident girl like you.

260
00:17:27.797 --> 00:17:29.674
You have split ends on your tail.

261
00:17:29.757 --> 00:17:31.634
Don't pull it out, it will hurt.

262
00:17:31.717 --> 00:17:32.593
I won't.

263
00:17:33.678 --> 00:17:37.807
<i>Does he have... a girlfriend?</i>

264
00:17:38.724 --> 00:17:40.810
Everybody, let's go back to school now!

265
00:17:41.644 --> 00:17:43.312
It's already dark out here.

266
00:17:43.396 --> 00:17:44.730
Rouis has already left.

267
00:17:44.814 --> 00:17:47.358
Dom is so energetic.

268
00:17:48.609 --> 00:17:51.862
-Hello.
-Hi, Juno.

269
00:17:51.946 --> 00:17:55.533
Thank you for waiting.
The actors are ready to leave, too.

270
00:17:56.993 --> 00:17:57.994
Legoshi,

271
00:17:58.661 --> 00:18:00.705
I did pretty well in the rehearsal,

272
00:18:00.788 --> 00:18:03.583
thanks to your support.

273
00:18:05.042 --> 00:18:07.712
No problem at all. I didn't do anything.

274
00:18:08.379 --> 00:18:11.966
<i>His facial expressions are the same</i>
<i>when he talks to me or to others.</i>

275
00:18:12.049 --> 00:18:13.009
Let's go, then.

276
00:18:15.386 --> 00:18:19.098
Oh! The meteor has been completed already!

277
00:18:20.474 --> 00:18:21.726
Yeah, you're right.

278
00:18:23.144 --> 00:18:26.480
If you place a lit candle at the meteor
with someone you love,

279
00:18:26.564 --> 00:18:28.357
the couple will be blessed.

280
00:18:28.441 --> 00:18:30.610
Do you believe that?

281
00:18:32.486 --> 00:18:33.779
I don't know...

282
00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:36.490
It'd be great if it were true.

283
00:18:37.241 --> 00:18:39.619
The couple will be blessed...

284
00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:44.123
Ah, um... Legoshi.

285
00:18:44.915 --> 00:18:46.584
On the festival day,

286
00:18:46.667 --> 00:18:48.044
would you be--

287
00:18:50.546 --> 00:18:51.672
What?

288
00:18:51.756 --> 00:18:53.591
We lost the power... This is bad!

289
00:18:55.384 --> 00:18:57.011
Is everybody all right?

290
00:18:57.094 --> 00:18:58.596
Legoshi? Where are you?

291
00:18:59.388 --> 00:19:02.183
I'm here. I will hold your hand, okay?

292
00:19:02.892 --> 00:19:03.768
Yes...

293
00:19:04.435 --> 00:19:05.853
What happened?

294
00:19:06.812 --> 00:19:09.190
I think it's a power outage. Don't worry.

295
00:19:09.273 --> 00:19:10.816
We, the nocturnal, will protect you.

296
00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:12.568
Els! Are you all right?

297
00:19:12.652 --> 00:19:13.903
Yeah, I'm okay...

298
00:19:13.986 --> 00:19:16.822
Let's come and get together in one place.

299
00:19:16.906 --> 00:19:18.658
Everybody, get in the circle!

300
00:19:18.741 --> 00:19:20.242
Isn't the power back yet?

301
00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:22.203
I'm scared. I can't see anything.

302
00:19:22.286 --> 00:19:24.538
It's all right.
The power will be back soon.

303
00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:28.292
<i>No wonder they get frightened.</i>

304
00:19:28.376 --> 00:19:31.337
<i>Devour incidents always occur</i>

305
00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.339
<i>when it's completely dark outside.</i>

306
00:19:34.173 --> 00:19:36.217
How many of us are here today?

307
00:19:37.134 --> 00:19:38.678
Let's see...

308
00:19:40.596 --> 00:19:44.809
Thanks, but it's okay. I'm almost done,
so you can go back now.

309
00:19:45.518 --> 00:19:49.355
Aoba, sorry! I have to go.
Please take care of them.

310
00:19:49.438 --> 00:19:51.065
-Hey!
-I'll be back soon!

311
00:19:52.149 --> 00:19:54.026
How come he could leave us like this?

312
00:19:55.986 --> 00:19:57.446
Haru!

313
00:19:58.197 --> 00:19:59.365
Haru?

314
00:20:01.242 --> 00:20:02.159
Haru?

315
00:20:03.577 --> 00:20:04.787
<i>She's not here...</i>

316
00:20:05.371 --> 00:20:06.539
<i>Where is she?</i>

317
00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:10.710
<i>Calm down. I still smell her,</i>
<i>so she should be around.</i>

318
00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:12.878
<i>Concentrate.</i>

319
00:20:12.962 --> 00:20:16.048
<i>Track it. Track her scent.</i>

320
00:20:16.132 --> 00:20:18.134
<i>Please stay safe.</i>

321
00:20:34.275 --> 00:20:36.318
-What a relief...
-Rouis!

322
00:20:36.402 --> 00:20:37.695
I'm so glad you came!

323
00:20:47.913 --> 00:20:49.039
Legoshi?

324
00:20:50.207 --> 00:20:53.669
I... am sorry. Oh, gosh. I'm so sorry.

325
00:20:53.753 --> 00:20:55.087
I thought you were...

326
00:20:57.006 --> 00:21:00.259
It's okay. I'm glad you are safe.

327
00:21:01.552 --> 00:21:03.929
I couldn't see anything at all. I'm sorry.

328
00:21:04.013 --> 00:21:05.639
I know. Are you hurt?

329
00:21:05.723 --> 00:21:08.184
Your uniform got dirty. Here, use this.

330
00:21:09.518 --> 00:21:12.188
-I'm so sorry.
-It's okay. Take it.

331
00:21:14.482 --> 00:21:16.609
-Thank you.
-Have you been here since?

332
00:21:17.568 --> 00:21:20.988
<i>It can't be...</i>

333
00:21:21.071 --> 00:21:23.324
<i>A wolf and a rabbit?</i>

334
00:21:23.407 --> 00:21:26.869
<i>Of course not! That's not possible!</i>

335
00:21:27.661 --> 00:21:29.914
<i>But... Wait...</i>

336
00:21:32.875 --> 00:21:34.084
<i>No way!</i>

337
00:23:03.966 --> 00:23:05.968
