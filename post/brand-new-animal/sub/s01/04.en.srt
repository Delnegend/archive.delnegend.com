3
00:01:19,074 --> 00:01:21,6
Damn it, it's no use!

4
00:01:21,074 --> 00:01:23,4
What are you doing?

5
00:01:23,075 --> 00:01:27,5
Uhm, I was trying to go back to my human form...

6
00:01:27,067 --> 00:01:30,3
You're a weird kid.

7
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,5
Ah, more importantly, you have a call from the council.

8
00:01:34,063 --> 00:01:35,8
A call?

9
00:01:39,084 --> 00:01:42,8
It's your beastman registration credential and your insurance card.

10
00:01:43,022 --> 00:01:45,3
Formalities were still in order, so...

11
00:01:45,048 --> 00:01:47,8
Consider it as a thank you for the bomb incident.

12
00:01:48,002 --> 00:01:49,8
It's been a bit rough for you, right?

13
00:01:49,094 --> 00:01:51,3
Thank you.

14
00:01:51,073 --> 00:01:54,2
With this, you're now officially part of Animacity.

15
00:01:54,098 --> 00:01:56,8
Welcome to the Beastmen Capital.

16
00:01:56,099 --> 00:01:59,6
Ah, yeah.

17
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:00,7
Ah, right!

18
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,7
I'm giving this back.

19
00:02:03,012 --> 00:02:05,1
Don't worry, you can keep it.

20
00:02:05,029 --> 00:02:07,3
...But I can't use it.

21
00:02:07,075 --> 00:02:11,2
It doesn't connect to the outside internet, does it?

22
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,3
No matter how many times I tried, only the council site came up.

23
00:02:14,075 --> 00:02:21,0
That's correct. Information on human society is restricted by the Special Beastman Territory Law.

24
00:02:21,018 --> 00:02:22,1
That's unfair!

25
00:02:22,085 --> 00:02:26,1
Ms. Michiru, this is a good chance, so please remember this.

26
00:02:29,035 --> 00:02:33,8
Beastmen, or rather, the Beastman species is different from the Homo Sapiens species.

27
00:02:33,094 --> 00:02:36,2
Thanks to a special gene called "Beast Factor"...

28
00:02:36,036 --> 00:02:39,3
...we can freely change our bodies.

29
00:02:39,045 --> 00:02:43,3
In ancient times, beastmen were worshipped by their tribes...

30
00:02:43,045 --> 00:02:45,8
...and made them look like beast gods.

31
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,9
They wanted to be like gods.

32
00:02:50,025 --> 00:02:53,7
That's why your beast form is decided based on ancestry.

33
00:02:53,088 --> 00:02:55,3
A lion's child will be a lion.

34
00:02:55,084 --> 00:02:59,7
If two species breed, only one of the parents' attributes will prevail.

35
00:02:59,088 --> 00:03:03,0
The resulting child will be either a lion or a tiger.

36
00:03:03,018 --> 00:03:05,5
It won't be a liger.

37
00:03:05,097 --> 00:03:10,9
Of course, humans without a beast factor can't change into a beastman.

38
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,4
But I...

39
00:03:13,098 --> 00:03:18,1
That's right. The impossible happened to you.

40
00:03:20,082 --> 00:03:26,2
Beastmen have always lived having no contact with the Homo Sapiens... Humans.

41
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:29,5
Be it a forest or a mountain, a deserted island, a desert...

42
00:03:29,091 --> 00:03:35,4
But due to human environmental development, we had to show ourselves to them whether we wanted to or not.

43
00:03:36,054 --> 00:03:43,8
Since the discovery of the beastman species, there were a couple of conflicts, but we somehow managed to establish Animacity.

44
00:03:44,001 --> 00:03:45,8
But that's when you came in.

45
00:03:47,014 --> 00:03:49,3
I researched your genes.

46
00:03:49,052 --> 00:03:51,6
They are different from a regular beast factor.

47
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:57,7
It's unstable, but an explosion-like cell division occurs when you change shapes.

48
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:01,6
That's probably the reason behind your ability to freely change your form.

49
00:04:01,078 --> 00:04:03,6
It's still just a hypothesis, though.

50
00:04:03,074 --> 00:04:04,8
Is it curable?

51
00:04:04,095 --> 00:04:06,4
I don't know that yet.

52
00:04:07,016 --> 00:04:09,1
Give me some more time.

53
00:04:09,024 --> 00:04:12,2
In any case, please stay with the association.

54
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,3
Okay...

55
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:19,3
I kinda get it, but I also don't...

56
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:22,8
...though I can't use this, that's for sure.

57
00:04:22,092 --> 00:04:24,7
Heya, tanuki girl!

58
00:04:24,084 --> 00:04:27,3
Ah, it's the weasel...
I said I'm a mink.

59
00:04:27,051 --> 00:04:30,4
Anyway, I got my hands on some real good stuff! Wanna see?

60
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,5
No, thank you.

61
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:34,5
What?

62
00:04:36,035 --> 00:04:40,9
Illegal phones that can jump over the Animacity firewall...

63
00:04:41,028 --> 00:04:44,1
If you just want a SIM card, it's 50% off.

64
00:04:44,028 --> 00:04:46,4
It's a time-limited sale~

65
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,5
Ten, nine...

66
00:04:48,066 --> 00:04:49,6
B-but I don't have...

67
00:04:49,066 --> 00:04:50,9
Eight... Seven...
B-but I don't have...

68
00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:51,1
Eight... Seven...

69
00:04:51,012 --> 00:04:52,5
Can you put it in my tab?
Eight... Seven...

70
00:04:52,066 --> 00:04:54,2
Not my tab, but Shirou's!

71
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:04,5
My daughter got mad at me recently so I bought an e-cig...

72
00:05:04,067 --> 00:05:06,2
...but that's useless.

73
00:05:06,038 --> 00:05:07,4
I'm telling the truth.

74
00:05:07,084 --> 00:05:10,8
…I don't know who distributed the Medical center supplies...!

75
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,6
You were seen by Shirou Oogami.

76
00:05:15,077 --> 00:05:18,4
That's your problem.

77
00:05:18,052 --> 00:05:19,9
Hey, Kusakabe.

78
00:05:20,006 --> 00:05:23,8
How do we deal with men who can't even take responsibility for their own mistakes?

79
00:05:31,062 --> 00:05:34,2
Flip. I have business with that man.

80
00:05:37,021 --> 00:05:38,1
You'll have to wait.

81
00:05:39,008 --> 00:05:42,0
We're not done here yet.

82
00:05:51,014 --> 00:05:52,0
Stop it!

83
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:56,3
Aah, stop i--!

84
00:06:04,078 --> 00:06:08,1
It seems your business is gone.

85
00:06:33,035 --> 00:06:34,5
Hey guys!

86
00:06:34,064 --> 00:06:38,2
Having to go out in a hurry is rough, eh?

87
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:41,7
For that occasion, I'll be recommending some cosmetics!

88
00:06:41,085 --> 00:06:45,3
Even if you're out of time, you'll look like you put a lot of effort into it!

89
00:06:52,024 --> 00:06:53,5
Humans are living here?

90
00:06:57,025 --> 00:06:59,1
The foundation I used today is this...

91
00:06:59,025 --> 00:07:00,2
Excuse me!

92
00:07:02,058 --> 00:07:04,1
Ah, excuse me...

93
00:07:04,067 --> 00:07:05,8
A-are you...

94
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,3
W-what the hell?

95
00:07:16,047 --> 00:07:17,7
Hey, you bastard.

96
00:07:18,018 --> 00:07:20,7
Who ordered you to get close to the lady?

97
00:07:21,014 --> 00:07:23,7
Uh... Who's the lady?

98
00:07:24,081 --> 00:07:26,3
I mean...

99
00:07:27,036 --> 00:07:29,1
Where am I?

100
00:07:30,078 --> 00:07:32,3
Don't play dumb.

101
00:07:32,045 --> 00:07:37,5
You knew she was The Family's daughter so you closed in on her, didn't you?

102
00:07:37,066 --> 00:07:40,1
The Family?

103
00:07:41,087 --> 00:07:43,1
Do you mean...

104
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,9
...that one gang?

105
00:07:45,008 --> 00:07:46,7
Seems you've remembered something.

106
00:07:46,088 --> 00:07:47,9
Spit it out.

107
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,3
What do you want getting close to the lady?!

108
00:07:50,047 --> 00:07:53,5
That's not it! I just happened to see her in Facelook...

109
00:07:53,063 --> 00:07:55,0
Facelook?

110
00:07:55,047 --> 00:07:57,1
Do you know about Facelook?

111
00:07:59,002 --> 00:08:01,0
I happened to come over here just recently...

112
00:08:01,035 --> 00:08:03,0
You come from the mainland?

113
00:08:03,014 --> 00:08:05,6
No way! That's awesome!!

114
00:08:07,006 --> 00:08:10,9
Really? Where? Tokyo? Shibuya? Harajuku? Omote-sando?

115
00:08:11,011 --> 00:08:12,7
More from the countryside...

116
00:08:12,086 --> 00:08:14,8
I'm Nina. What's your name?

117
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:16,6
Mi... Michiru.

118
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,7
So you were a beastman...

119
00:08:19,087 --> 00:08:22,0
You mean humans were watching me?

120
00:08:22,025 --> 00:08:23,9
Amazing!

121
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,4
I show myself as a human on the net.

122
00:08:26,058 --> 00:08:28,6
To hide my shiny beast form~

123
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,9
You can go now.

124
00:08:34,034 --> 00:08:36,2
Hey, is your dad...

125
00:08:37,068 --> 00:08:39,6
Ugh, I hate my dad.

126
00:08:39,093 --> 00:08:41,2
That's my grandpa.

127
00:08:41,072 --> 00:08:44,2
He was caught by humans before I was born...

128
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,7
...boiled in soy sauce and eaten. It's what my dad says.

129
00:08:47,086 --> 00:08:48,6
What the hell.

130
00:08:49,002 --> 00:08:52,1
Right? There's no way!

131
00:08:52,028 --> 00:08:54,8
Just recently I was caught listening to human music...

132
00:08:54,095 --> 00:08:56,6
...so now I'm not allowed outside.

133
00:08:57,016 --> 00:08:59,4
They say it's "indecent and harmful".

134
00:09:00,008 --> 00:09:02,1
I know! Let me show you something cool!

135
00:09:03,012 --> 00:09:05,0
These are my treasures!

136
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:09,0
They are things that washed up on the beach, or gifts I got!

137
00:09:09,071 --> 00:09:12,0
Is that nostalgic? Do you know what that is?

138
00:09:12,038 --> 00:09:14,2
It seems just one piece washed up.

139
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,8
They don't have cables, right?

140
00:09:20,043 --> 00:09:25,4
(NIGHT RUNNING starts playing)

141
00:09:37,086 --> 00:09:40,9
Hey! You're on a diet until the audition, aren't you?

142
00:09:41,003 --> 00:09:42,7
I can eat this!

143
00:09:46,008 --> 00:09:49,1
You're really different from everyone else.

144
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:52,9
People who come here don't wanna talk about the mainland.

145
00:09:53,084 --> 00:09:55,2
Do you wanna go back?

146
00:10:03,018 --> 00:10:06,3
I can't return looking like this.

147
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:10,6
I want to go back.

148
00:10:12,032 --> 00:10:13,0
Michiru?

149
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:18,9
I'm back...? I'm back! How?!

150
00:10:20,082 --> 00:10:22,8
No tail anymore so I can pass through gaps!

151
00:10:23,003 --> 00:10:24,4
I can put hats on!!

152
00:10:28,046 --> 00:10:32,2
That's right. This is the real me!

153
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:34,9
Were you always in beast form?

154
00:10:35,038 --> 00:10:37,8
Ah, uh... Y-yeah!

155
00:10:37,092 --> 00:10:40,3
I forgot how to return to my human form...

156
00:10:40,051 --> 00:10:42,3
So, you can go back home.

157
00:10:43,022 --> 00:10:44,8
You can go to the mainland!

158
00:10:53,031 --> 00:10:54,1
Nina!

159
00:10:55,061 --> 00:10:57,1
Hold on, Nina!

160
00:10:59,095 --> 00:11:02,6
You know, a girl named Lisa from Facelook...

161
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,9
...is holding a home party.

162
00:11:05,016 --> 00:11:07,1
I'm invited!

163
00:11:08,091 --> 00:11:11,0
Are you serious?

164
00:11:11,017 --> 00:11:13,3
If you hop onto my back, we'll be there in no time!

165
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,8
If we return quickly, there's no problem, right?

166
00:11:17,084 --> 00:11:20,5
Why do you want to go over there so bad?

167
00:11:22,022 --> 00:11:26,6
Only knowing this island my whole life... I don't want that.

168
00:11:26,072 --> 00:11:28,2
Besides...

169
00:11:30,068 --> 00:11:32,7
The city is sparkling.

170
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,8
Let's go.

171
00:11:49,058 --> 00:11:51,3
Nina!

172
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:55,2
Papa is back home!

173
00:11:55,084 --> 00:11:57,7
Nina~

174
00:12:00,063 --> 00:12:01,4
Nina?

175
00:12:02,076 --> 00:12:03,9
My deepest apologies!

176
00:12:13,048 --> 00:12:15,2
It was farther than I thought.

177
00:12:23,015 --> 00:12:24,9
Oh no! We gotta hide!

178
00:12:25,007 --> 00:12:26,7
Eh? Why?

179
00:12:26,087 --> 00:12:29,6
There's police who help beast hunters, too!

180
00:12:29,074 --> 00:12:30,7
Hey, you girls!

181
00:12:31,075 --> 00:12:35,0
It's pretty dark around here, so be careful!

182
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,1
Michiru... You worry too much.

183
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,0
How did you live here?

184
00:12:44,059 --> 00:12:46,8
Ah, it's there!

185
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:26,3
(NIGHT RUNNING starts playing from the speakers)

186
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,2
Michiru!

187
00:13:43,086 --> 00:13:46,8
So this is the taste of macaroons, huh?

188
00:13:48,011 --> 00:13:50,7
Ah, what's wrong? Are you okay?

189
00:13:51,078 --> 00:13:53,7
Yeah, I'm fine.

190
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,4
You're... glad you came, right?

191
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,3
Yeah. I'm glad I was able to come back.

192
00:14:02,059 --> 00:14:04,0
Hey, Nina!

193
00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:05,5
You're Nina, right?

194
00:14:06,022 --> 00:14:09,3
You really came! We're finally meeting in real life!

195
00:14:09,043 --> 00:14:12,0
Ah, are you Lisa?

196
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,2
We're finally meeting~!

197
00:14:19,006 --> 00:14:20,6
Oh, that's bad...!

198
00:14:22,065 --> 00:14:25,6
No way... No way no way no way!

199
00:14:25,099 --> 00:14:30,5
You were a beastman all along? And you're also a dolphin? So cute!!

200
00:14:32,062 --> 00:14:33,7
Help me out, guys.

201
00:14:33,091 --> 00:14:35,7
Let's go!

202
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,1
Everyone, listen.

203
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:41,6
We got a very special guest for our beastman costume party!

204
00:14:41,075 --> 00:14:43,8
A beastman... Nina!

205
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:50,5
Did you forget yours? I'll let you borrow these.

206
00:14:51,014 --> 00:14:55,8
The pain and suffering that Nina has had to face due to discrimination...

207
00:14:55,097 --> 00:14:58,0
...we can't even being to comprehend it.

208
00:14:58,073 --> 00:15:00,5
I'm sure it was very hard on you.

209
00:15:00,064 --> 00:15:03,1
Eh? I mean, I'm not really...

210
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:07,2
Let's praise the beauty and courage of Nina's way of living!

211
00:15:19,037 --> 00:15:20,9
Shirou, you got a call!

212
00:15:21,075 --> 00:15:26,0
Oogami, do you know where Michiru is and who she's with?

213
00:15:26,084 --> 00:15:29,5
She's hanging out with Flip's daughter over there.

214
00:15:30,001 --> 00:15:32,5
If The Family finds out...

215
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:34,0
...it'll be a big problem.

216
00:15:34,051 --> 00:15:38,0
You want me to take them back home before anything happens.

217
00:15:38,014 --> 00:15:39,6
Thank you.

218
00:15:52,057 --> 00:15:55,2
You asshole! You wanna die that badly?!

219
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,1
I have business with Flip.

220
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:02,3
I'm busy now. Move.

221
00:16:03,008 --> 00:16:05,7
Do you plan on starting a war with humans?

222
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,9
So what if I do?

223
00:16:08,063 --> 00:16:10,4
I'll bring your daughter back.

224
00:16:11,001 --> 00:16:12,3
And why would you do that?

225
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,9
You can either leave it to me or argue pointlessly here.

226
00:16:17,005 --> 00:16:18,1
Make your choice.

227
00:16:18,068 --> 00:16:21,5
Hm. I'll wait until midnight.

228
00:16:21,098 --> 00:16:25,8
If she doesn't come back before then, you're all turning into minced beef.

229
00:16:41,004 --> 00:16:43,0
Did you see that?

230
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:46,7
Nina, let's go home.
Why?

231
00:16:47,025 --> 00:16:50,1
I don't... I don't know, but...

232
00:16:50,025 --> 00:16:52,0
Something's off.

233
00:16:52,017 --> 00:16:54,7
This isn't the place I wanted to return to.

234
00:16:55,018 --> 00:16:57,8
Why? Everyone's nice, aren't they?

235
00:16:58,001 --> 00:17:01,7
Don't tell me you don't like this just because I'm the popular one.

236
00:17:02,018 --> 00:17:03,5
What are you talking about?

237
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:07,4
If that's the case, just go and say you're a beastman too.

238
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,9
I'm not going back home.

239
00:17:19,078 --> 00:17:23,0
What am I doing...?

240
00:17:28,025 --> 00:17:29,1
Yeah.

241
00:17:29,071 --> 00:17:32,9
I don't care if you left Animacity.

242
00:17:33,009 --> 00:17:33,9
Do what you want.

243
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,1
But return Flip's daughter immediately.

244
00:17:37,026 --> 00:17:39,7
What? How do you know that?

245
00:17:39,089 --> 00:17:43,3
Flip's ready to start a war with humans.

246
00:17:43,052 --> 00:17:46,8
I'm heading over there soon. Figure it out before that.

247
00:17:47,002 --> 00:17:47,8
Got it?

248
00:17:47,098 --> 00:17:50,0
H-hold...! Why so sudden...?

249
00:17:52,015 --> 00:17:54,4
Seeing you entrust work to someone else...

250
00:17:54,061 --> 00:17:56,4
The sky might as well fall.

251
00:17:56,082 --> 00:17:58,4
Damn it.

252
00:17:58,053 --> 00:18:01,1
That's the first time I've seen a beastman!

253
00:18:01,024 --> 00:18:02,6
Yeah, me too!

254
00:18:03,029 --> 00:18:08,0
But isn't it actually kind of scary? She's like half a beast, isn't she?

255
00:18:08,017 --> 00:18:12,5
RIght? I wouldn't be able to live with her!

256
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:22,6
What are you doing?!

257
00:18:22,072 --> 00:18:26,6
Nina looked tired, so I thought to put her in the water.

258
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,8
I mean, she's a dolphin, right?

259
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:35,2
Ah, Nina!

260
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,2
Nina!!

261
00:19:13,048 --> 00:19:14,9
Are you okay?

262
00:19:16,036 --> 00:19:19,0
Let's go home.
Yeah...

263
00:19:38,055 --> 00:19:39,4
Michiru...

264
00:19:40,047 --> 00:19:42,9
I'm sorry.
Don't worry.

265
00:19:43,005 --> 00:19:44,8
I'm the one who's sorry.

266
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,8
If you didn't go to the human world...

267
00:19:47,097 --> 00:19:49,8
...you would still like it.

268
00:19:51,019 --> 00:19:53,5
I should've stopped you.

269
00:19:54,002 --> 00:19:57,5
I don't particularly hate it.

270
00:19:58,073 --> 00:20:01,8
I mean, it was really sparkling!

271
00:20:06,045 --> 00:20:07,7
I see.

272
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:19,9
Didn't you want to return there?

273
00:20:20,009 --> 00:20:23,3
That's right. I wanna leave Animacity.

274
00:20:24,013 --> 00:20:26,7
But not right now.

275
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:30,2
I wanna know more about beastmen.

276
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:32,5
I feel I need to.

277
00:20:33,069 --> 00:20:37,6
That's why I still wanna be in that city.

278
00:20:39,007 --> 00:20:41,9
You bought things using my tab.

279
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,5
Work and pay it back.

280
00:20:43,065 --> 00:20:45,7
What? Make it a present!

281
00:20:45,086 --> 00:20:48,1
It's my birthday, you know!
I don't care.

282
00:20:48,028 --> 00:20:49,7
Cheapskate.
Cheapskate?

283
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,9
Stingy wolf.
Thief tanuki.

284
00:20:52,008 --> 00:20:53,5
That's-- I mean...

285
00:21:03,005 --> 00:21:06,8
…An immortal body, and someone who can transform their body beyond a beast form...

286
00:21:07,064 --> 00:21:10,2
There's no way they're normal beastmen...

287
00:21:11,001 --> 00:21:12,7
...these two.

288
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,3
