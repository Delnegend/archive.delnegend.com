3
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,0
To the beastman in flight...

4
00:01:16,082 --> 00:01:19,9
...you are invading Japanese airspace without permission.

5
00:01:20,003 --> 00:01:23,7
Please land and fill the required entry paperwork immediately.

6
00:01:24,012 --> 00:01:25,8
I'm a wandering albatross.

7
00:01:25,096 --> 00:01:29,7
That should be covered by the International Migratory Bird Convention...

8
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:32,9
Beastmen don't fall under the Migratory Convention.

9
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:37,1
If you continue to fly, we will consider this an airspace violation and attack accordingly.

10
00:01:37,026 --> 00:01:39,3
No sense of humor, huh...

11
00:01:39,047 --> 00:01:42,0
Civil workers are pretty strict...

12
00:01:55,061 --> 00:01:59,0
Pushing your own "justice" onto others and pitying them...

13
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,2
...and deciding to "help them out"...

14
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:03,9
...isn't that just to stroke your own ego?

15
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:07,8
We were finally reunited, so why...?

16
00:02:07,096 --> 00:02:08,7
Damn it!

17
00:02:18,063 --> 00:02:21,6
This is like The Spirit of St. Louis...

18
00:02:21,076 --> 00:02:24,5
...but this storm is a little rough.

19
00:02:34,027 --> 00:02:36,6
I'm trying my best...

20
00:02:36,082 --> 00:02:38,7
What's she mean with "pushing it"?

21
00:02:53,092 --> 00:02:56,1
What...?

22
00:03:08,043 --> 00:03:12,9
Damn... What a screw-up.

23
00:03:13,006 --> 00:03:14,6
Oh! You're awake?

24
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:22,9
Oh, was that my doing?

25
00:03:23,007 --> 00:03:26,2
Yeah! You made quite a nice hole.

26
00:03:26,091 --> 00:03:28,8
You should go back to bed.

27
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,0
I mean, I caused this whole mess...

28
00:03:32,017 --> 00:03:33,7
...so I can't really sleep.

29
00:03:34,075 --> 00:03:37,5
Looks like you're fine.

30
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:43,8
Be careful, girl.

31
00:03:43,093 --> 00:03:45,7
A gust of wind is coming.

32
00:03:51,002 --> 00:03:53,1
Michiru!

33
00:04:05,032 --> 00:04:09,2
Heh, warm food really is the best.

34
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:10,9
Been long since you last had any?

35
00:04:11,008 --> 00:04:13,4
I'm always up in the sky.

36
00:04:13,058 --> 00:04:16,6
Are you also here in Animacity to take refuge?

37
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,0
We should get you registered, then.

38
00:04:19,034 --> 00:04:23,5
I'm not staying for long. I'm a wandering albatross, after all.

39
00:04:23,088 --> 00:04:26,2
Wandering? Are you migrating?

40
00:04:26,059 --> 00:04:27,7
Yeah.

41
00:04:27,085 --> 00:04:30,1
I'm jealous...
Of what?

42
00:04:30,022 --> 00:04:33,5
You can fly, right? And you can go anywhere.

43
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:36,9
If I was able to fly, it would've been easier for me to get here.

44
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,4
You wanna fly, girl?

45
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,9
What? Oh, yeah!

46
00:04:44,036 --> 00:04:46,7
I looked up the Silver Wolf Order.

47
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:51,2
It used to be a private religion of sorts up until half a year ago...

48
00:04:51,037 --> 00:04:56,9
...but it grew exponentially and gained more power as soon as Boris Cliff joined.

49
00:04:57,029 --> 00:05:00,5
And their guru seems to be an old friend of that tanuki girl.

50
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:04,9
They both have this "beastman disease", and they're close friends.

51
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:08,1
That can't be a coincidence... right?

52
00:05:08,055 --> 00:05:10,0
Did they infect one another?

53
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,8
If that were the case, the disease would've spread more.

54
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,3
That's true.

55
00:05:14,073 --> 00:05:16,8
The mystery just keeps on growing.

56
00:05:16,098 --> 00:05:19,3
I'll let the cult stay for now.

57
00:05:19,048 --> 00:05:22,3
If they're infected, it's best to keep them under observation.

58
00:05:23,048 --> 00:05:25,7
Mayor, you have a visitor.

59
00:05:27,007 --> 00:05:29,0
I don't have anything in my schedule.

60
00:05:29,016 --> 00:05:30,2
That's...

61
00:05:32,004 --> 00:05:35,5
Apologies for the sudden visit.

62
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,6
It's been a while, Mayor Rose Barbarei.

63
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,6
President Alan. To think you'd humble me with a visit...

64
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,9
I'm sorry. I visited on a whim.

65
00:05:48,013 --> 00:05:49,6
I'm Alan Sylvasta.

66
00:05:49,076 --> 00:05:52,8
The boss of Sylvasta Pharmaceutics. Nice to meet you.

67
00:05:53,018 --> 00:05:54,3
I'm Shirou Oogami.

68
00:05:54,081 --> 00:05:56,0
Do you dislike handshakes?

69
00:05:56,052 --> 00:05:59,3
Yeah. I don't want human smell on me.

70
00:05:59,044 --> 00:06:01,1
I see. My apologies.

71
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:04,0
Mr. Oogami is the Mayor's advisor.

72
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:07,4
He's been helping ever since Animacity was established.

73
00:06:07,057 --> 00:06:10,1
That means we're in the same position.

74
00:06:10,049 --> 00:06:13,3
I fund the city, and you use your intelligence.

75
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:16,7
Thank you for your work in Sylvasta Pharmaceutics' bomb incident.

76
00:06:17,046 --> 00:06:18,7
You knew about that...

77
00:06:19,021 --> 00:06:25,0
You and that cute assistant of yours exposed the foolish crimes of Mr. Yaba and his companions.

78
00:06:25,021 --> 00:06:26,5
I got the reports about it.

79
00:06:26,092 --> 00:06:28,8
Cute assistant?

80
00:06:28,093 --> 00:06:31,8
Am I wrong? I mean that tanuki girl.

81
00:06:31,097 --> 00:06:33,1
She's not cute.

82
00:06:33,055 --> 00:06:37,8
Hahaha... I'm just being polite. Don't take it too seriously.

83
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:42,1
I'm sorry for coming here uninvited.

84
00:06:42,023 --> 00:06:45,3
It seems you want that Silver Wolf Order to stay here.

85
00:06:47,024 --> 00:06:50,4
It's best if you drop that.

86
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:54,6
If we do that, the whole purpose of this city collapses.

87
00:06:55,028 --> 00:06:56,4
That's true.

88
00:06:56,062 --> 00:07:00,4
Animacity is meant to be a refuge for oppressed beastmen.

89
00:07:00,058 --> 00:07:03,7
By living here, they get used to the human way of living...

90
00:07:03,084 --> 00:07:07,0
...and learn how to behave in order to coexist with humans.

91
00:07:07,017 --> 00:07:12,6
I resonated with that, so as the human representative, I chose to give you financial aid.

92
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,9
That's right. Animacity rejects no beastmen.

93
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:16,9
So why?

94
00:07:17,068 --> 00:07:19,8
Heheh... a whim, perhaps?

95
00:07:21,056 --> 00:07:25,6
Wow, those are some nice fangs! As expected of a wolf beastman.

96
00:07:26,015 --> 00:07:27,6
Oogami!

97
00:07:27,082 --> 00:07:30,5
I'm sure the successor of the Sylvasta Conglomerate...

98
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:33,9
...isn't someone who would act on a whim.

99
00:07:34,032 --> 00:07:37,0
You think too highly of me.

100
00:07:37,016 --> 00:07:41,7
I just think the Silver Wolf Order isn't needed in Animacity.

101
00:07:41,087 --> 00:07:43,0
Why?

102
00:07:43,021 --> 00:07:45,7
Beastmen continue to modernize themselves...

103
00:07:45,088 --> 00:07:49,4
...so inviting a beastman cult would have an adverse effect, wouldn't it?

104
00:07:49,059 --> 00:07:51,4
It would encourage anti-beastmen.

105
00:07:51,097 --> 00:07:52,8
Did you know?

106
00:07:53,043 --> 00:07:57,2
The Parliament, the members of anti-beastmen movements, journalists...

107
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:02,7
Lately, the leaders of beastmen rights movements
have been getting attacked at every opportunity by them.

108
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:06,4
There's also info on an unidentified flying beastman trespassing.

109
00:08:06,077 --> 00:08:09,2
Of course, the decision making is up to you.

110
00:08:09,098 --> 00:08:14,4
Depending on your decision, I might need to change my opinion.

111
00:08:15,011 --> 00:08:17,7
Is that a threat?
It's a warning.

112
00:08:17,091 --> 00:08:23,3
I'll be in charge of looking over the chief-less Medical Center from now on.

113
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:27,8
I'd like to keep trusting you with Animacity like I have until now.

114
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:29,8
Farewell.

115
00:08:33,084 --> 00:08:36,1
This feels great! Whoa!

116
00:08:36,076 --> 00:08:39,0
The wind in this city is very peculiar.

117
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:41,8
Gotcha!

118
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:51,8
Whoa! That's amazing!

119
00:08:51,094 --> 00:08:53,6
How do you "catch the wind"?

120
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:57,3
How? You just know after getting used to it.

121
00:08:57,095 --> 00:09:00,6
Where the wind starts and where it wants to go...

122
00:09:00,074 --> 00:09:04,9
I learned that from my father. And my father, from my grandfather, and so on.

123
00:09:05,004 --> 00:09:07,5
Technically, it's down to humidity or pressure in the air...

124
00:09:07,063 --> 00:09:09,9
Well, there are a few complications...

125
00:09:10,004 --> 00:09:12,3
...but a beastman's body remembers.

126
00:09:12,092 --> 00:09:15,0
Must be nice being so free...

127
00:09:15,047 --> 00:09:20,0
Free... Well, it used to be like that.

128
00:09:21,035 --> 00:09:26,1
We're albatross beastmen. Like regular albatrosses, we migrate.

129
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:28,2
We've been doing that for generations.

130
00:09:29,015 --> 00:09:32,8
When beastmen started having the same rights as humans...

131
00:09:32,094 --> 00:09:34,8
...migrating was prohibited.

132
00:09:34,094 --> 00:09:37,4
You need a proper passport to cross national borders...

133
00:09:37,061 --> 00:09:40,2
...and need to go through proper migration procedures.

134
00:09:41,003 --> 00:09:42,6
I see...

135
00:09:43,024 --> 00:09:46,5
It's the route my ancestors had to fly through.

136
00:09:46,066 --> 00:09:49,1
It's rooted deep within our bodies.

137
00:09:49,025 --> 00:09:51,3
We can't change that now.

138
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:55,5
"Why do we have to accommodate to humans' convenience?"

139
00:09:55,067 --> 00:09:59,0
We had friends who said that and flew either way, only to be shot down.

140
00:09:59,034 --> 00:10:01,7
Saying it was "trespassing".

141
00:10:02,031 --> 00:10:03,9
That's terrible...

142
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:07,3
Beastmen are bound by the rules of humanity.

143
00:10:08,014 --> 00:10:12,3
Are humans really all that...?

144
00:10:15,007 --> 00:10:16,6
Could I have one of those?

145
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:18,2
These are made for beastmen.

146
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,7
Ah, can you tell I'm a human?

147
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,2
By the smell.

148
00:10:22,062 --> 00:10:24,6
Is that so? Oh well. Just give me one.

149
00:10:25,037 --> 00:10:26,4
Here you go.

150
00:10:29,012 --> 00:10:32,5
Yeah. I really can't drink this.

151
00:10:33,088 --> 00:10:36,5
Are you really going with what that kid said?

152
00:10:36,071 --> 00:10:39,3
Don't underestimate him just because he's young.

153
00:10:39,051 --> 00:10:43,3
The Sylvasta Conglomerate has been prestigious in Europe for generations.

154
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:47,0
They're looking to make Alan their leader.

155
00:10:47,043 --> 00:10:52,9
You know the source of income for this city comes directly  from Sylvasta Pharmaceutics' financial aid, don't you?

156
00:10:53,006 --> 00:10:55,4
That cult is fishy.

157
00:10:55,057 --> 00:10:58,5
But I dislike the idea of following a human's orders even more.

158
00:10:59,032 --> 00:11:03,5
We have to make a decision either way.

159
00:11:03,066 --> 00:11:05,5
Even if it results...

160
00:11:06,004 --> 00:11:09,2
...in making enemies among beastmen.

161
00:11:11,054 --> 00:11:13,6
We have confirmation from the government.

162
00:11:13,075 --> 00:11:18,6
It seems they've lost track of the bird beastman who trespassed into Animacity.

163
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,9
They say it's likely he's a terrorist who opposes the beastmen rights movement.

164
00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:27,1
It seems what Alan said wasn't just a threat after all.

165
00:11:31,064 --> 00:11:34,7
What's that fool doing?

166
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:42,6
Alright, the sightseeing flight is over, girl.

167
00:11:46,028 --> 00:11:48,2
Here. Sorry, they're dollars...

168
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,5
...but this is to pay for the roof.

169
00:11:51,012 --> 00:11:54,4
I'll probably be gone by tomorrow. This is goodbye.

170
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,1
You're leaving already?

171
00:11:56,054 --> 00:11:58,1
Well, I'm an albatross.

172
00:11:58,063 --> 00:12:00,0
You're right.

173
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,8
At least tell me your name.

174
00:12:03,018 --> 00:12:04,1
Pinga.

175
00:12:09,081 --> 00:12:14,8
See ya, Mr. Pinga! If you come to the city again, make sure to stop by!

176
00:12:24,095 --> 00:12:26,9
Where's that bird beastman?

177
00:12:27,003 --> 00:12:28,8
Oh, you mean Pinga?

178
00:12:28,095 --> 00:12:30,3
He left.

179
00:12:31,033 --> 00:12:32,1
What?

180
00:12:32,058 --> 00:12:35,4
He might be a terrorist.

181
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:38,2
Terrorist? No way~

182
00:12:38,038 --> 00:12:41,1
He said he'll leave the city tomorrow.

183
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:43,7
Then he might do something tonight.

184
00:12:44,047 --> 00:12:46,0
What's with you?

185
00:12:46,018 --> 00:12:48,1
I'm telling you he's not like that.

186
00:12:48,072 --> 00:12:52,1
Are you sure about that? You just flew together for a bit.

187
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,9
Don't say it like that...

188
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:57,1
I mean... why do you know we went flying?

189
00:12:57,031 --> 00:13:02,1
I saw you both recklessly flying around from the town hall.

190
00:13:02,065 --> 00:13:05,9
It wasn't reckless! Not at all.

191
00:13:06,011 --> 00:13:07,7
You just don't get it.

192
00:13:07,091 --> 00:13:08,7
What?

193
00:13:09,045 --> 00:13:11,6
I didn't know...

194
00:13:11,074 --> 00:13:15,9
I didn't know beastmen weren't happy even if they have their rights.

195
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:19,6
Albatross problems...
You knew about this?

196
00:13:20,042 --> 00:13:23,9
Pinga said he even had friends who were shot down.

197
00:13:24,067 --> 00:13:26,4
They must've had their reasons.

198
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:29,3
C'mon... Why do you always assume the worst?

199
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:34,1
It seems anti-beastmen terrorist groups are forming in Animacity.

200
00:13:34,027 --> 00:13:36,8
They're bird beastmen, too.

201
00:13:37,035 --> 00:13:40,0
This timing can't be a coincidence.

202
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,7
There's also no time to argue about it.

203
00:13:42,086 --> 00:13:46,4
We should find him and clear any suspicions then, right?

204
00:13:46,057 --> 00:13:47,9
If we can clear them.

205
00:13:48,007 --> 00:13:49,7
Can't you find him by smell?

206
00:13:49,091 --> 00:13:53,5
The sky is my weak point. All remaining smell must've dissipated by now.

207
00:13:53,095 --> 00:13:55,7
Is there any other way?

208
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:58,1
Even if there isn't, he's a target.

209
00:13:58,029 --> 00:13:59,5
Wait!

210
00:14:12,022 --> 00:14:17,8
The Silver Wolf Order was looking to settle in Animacity, but Mayor Rose refused their request.

211
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:21,9
She is preparing an alternate refuge, and is currently negotiating.

212
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:26,1
The mayor is saying "we don't have the required infrastructure to usher them in"...

213
00:14:26,024 --> 00:14:31,2
...and "we will temporarily relocate them, but we are making preparations to bring them into our city soon".

214
00:14:34,012 --> 00:14:35,7
Is this alright?

215
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:38,6
Yes. Everything is going according to plan.

216
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,1
Hey! The cult is moving!

217
00:14:45,046 --> 00:14:49,2
What? Seriously?
Yeah. Ginrou-sama is leading them.

218
00:14:49,038 --> 00:14:51,1
Ginrou-sama?

219
00:14:52,097 --> 00:14:57,6
We, the Silver Wolf Order, wished to settle in Animacity.

220
00:14:57,098 --> 00:15:01,6
However, Mayor Rose refused our wish.

221
00:15:01,073 --> 00:15:04,5
This is due to concerns from Sylvasta Pharmaceutics.

222
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:08,3
However, we are not the fanatics they think we are.

223
00:15:08,044 --> 00:15:11,1
We only wish for a paradise for beastmen.

224
00:15:11,049 --> 00:15:16,1
Let us pray! To dissipate any and all misunderstandings!

225
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:26,4
Rejoice!

226
00:15:26,055 --> 00:15:29,3
Ginrou is an entity who protects beastmen.

227
00:15:29,042 --> 00:15:34,3
Her light will bring about eternal calm to all beastmen!

228
00:15:36,047 --> 00:15:39,4
The cult is right in front of the Medical Center.

229
00:15:39,056 --> 00:15:42,9
It seems they noticed President Alan's interference.

230
00:15:43,002 --> 00:15:45,8
This isn't a message from the gods... is it?

231
00:15:46,023 --> 00:15:50,3
A lot of people saw him come into the Town Hall.

232
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:53,1
In any case, contact the police.

233
00:15:53,028 --> 00:15:57,0
Just to take a look at the situation. No violence.

234
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:19,1
Alright, let's go.

235
00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:32,9
What are you doing?!

236
00:16:38,024 --> 00:16:40,2
Terrorists in Animacity are unforgivable!

237
00:16:41,012 --> 00:16:43,4
I'd love it if you didn't get in my way.

238
00:16:47,033 --> 00:16:48,3
Shirou!

239
00:16:51,026 --> 00:16:53,5
Damn it, if I could just fly...!

240
00:16:54,001 --> 00:16:55,2
Don't think badly of me!

241
00:17:21,074 --> 00:17:23,7
Agh, I...

242
00:17:24,025 --> 00:17:26,5
want... to...!

243
00:17:30,042 --> 00:17:31,9
You can fly?!

244
00:17:32,042 --> 00:17:33,8
This is a first for me!

245
00:17:33,092 --> 00:17:35,6
A first?!
Yeah!

246
00:17:38,026 --> 00:17:39,3
Can you catch up to him?

247
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,1
Leave it to me!

248
00:17:49,048 --> 00:17:51,8
Hold on! Is that even possible?

249
00:17:56,011 --> 00:17:57,4
You won't get away this time.

250
00:18:08,062 --> 00:18:10,7
You're the tanuki girl.

251
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,9
Was I being fooled?

252
00:18:13,042 --> 00:18:15,7
You're an ex-soldier, aren't you?

253
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:19,3
Yeah, I used to be in the military when I was young.

254
00:18:19,051 --> 00:18:24,3
I believed in beastmen rights and fought against anti-beastmen extremists.

255
00:18:24,085 --> 00:18:26,9
To think that would result in being unable to fly...

256
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,8
...without thinking of the consequences...

257
00:18:29,035 --> 00:18:30,8
And that's why...

258
00:18:31,036 --> 00:18:33,7
That's why you think being a terrorist is okay?

259
00:18:33,086 --> 00:18:35,9
Did you really plan on attacking the Mayor?

260
00:18:36,011 --> 00:18:38,0
The bomb was a bluff.

261
00:18:38,045 --> 00:18:40,0
It isn't lethal at all.

262
00:18:40,016 --> 00:18:43,4
I had that as a threat so they would listen to me.

263
00:18:43,053 --> 00:18:46,2
Government officials wouldn't listen to me, either way.

264
00:18:47,045 --> 00:18:48,7
So? What will you do?

265
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:51,7
I just want to protect this city.

266
00:18:52,013 --> 00:18:53,2
Go.

267
00:18:53,034 --> 00:18:54,9
Right now.

268
00:18:55,042 --> 00:18:57,7
You haven't done anything yet.

269
00:19:00,076 --> 00:19:01,8
Girl...

270
00:19:03,072 --> 00:19:08,9
These are my comrades who were caught up in the conflict for beastmen rights and died.

271
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:14,3
If this is a beastman city, then I want to make tombs for them here.

272
00:19:15,002 --> 00:19:17,1
Please tell that to the Mayor.

273
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:18,2
Yeah.

274
00:19:18,065 --> 00:19:21,5
I'll tell her. I promise.

275
00:19:22,057 --> 00:19:25,6
Oh, right. I wasn't the only one flying to this city.

276
00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:27,6
There's someone else.

277
00:19:28,029 --> 00:19:31,0
There's only one beastman I know who could go that fast.

278
00:19:31,054 --> 00:19:34,2
In the "dark-side", we call him "Meteor".

279
00:19:34,092 --> 00:19:38,6
He's a hitman who will do anything for money. Be careful.

280
00:19:39,009 --> 00:19:41,1
Is he targeting the Mayor?

281
00:19:41,026 --> 00:19:43,8
No. If that was the case, I would know about it.

282
00:19:44,093 --> 00:19:46,4
That means...

283
00:19:48,097 --> 00:19:51,3
President, going out is dangerous!

284
00:19:51,044 --> 00:19:55,2
Don't worry. Running and hiding would just make things worse.

285
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:15,2
Are we too late?
What is that?

286
00:20:15,033 --> 00:20:17,0
Can you fly again?

287
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:40,3
Look! Look at Ginrou and her wings!

288
00:20:40,048 --> 00:20:45,1
Her grace befalls not only beastmen, but humans far and wide as well!

289
00:20:45,099 --> 00:20:50,0
Our founder, Ms. Déesse Louve, is just...

290
00:20:50,054 --> 00:20:53,5
the one who will save the world of beastmen!

291
00:20:55,067 --> 00:20:57,6
You failed. Give it up.

292
00:21:22,007 --> 00:21:24,4
Listen! Listen to the voices of the citizen!

293
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:28,5
Can you disregard these voices, Alan Sylvasta?

294
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:32,0
Damn, I'm done for.

295
00:21:39,088 --> 00:21:41,4
Amazing...

296
00:21:41,088 --> 00:21:43,9
You're amazing, Nazuna.
