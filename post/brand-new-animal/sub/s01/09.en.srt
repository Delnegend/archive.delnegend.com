3
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,3
Why don't you stop this "guru" thing?

4
00:01:07,069 --> 00:01:09,4
You're not Ginrou.

5
00:01:09,052 --> 00:01:11,8
You have no need to keep the lie up like that.

6
00:01:12,023 --> 00:01:14,3
Because the real Ginrou is out there.

7
00:01:15,045 --> 00:01:17,0
So what?

8
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,5
I'm the Silver Wolf Maiden, "Déesse Louve".

9
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:24,2
The order's "fanclub" is close to surpassing 5,000 members.

10
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,9
Their lives are full of sorrow, but just by looking at me, they feel a little better.

11
00:01:30,004 --> 00:01:34,0
Déesse Louve serves as a ray of hope for those people.

12
00:01:35,026 --> 00:01:39,1
I mean, Michiru, why did you come here to tell me that?

13
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,8
Did you come to accuse me of being a fake?

14
00:01:41,097 --> 00:01:43,7
No! I just...

15
00:01:43,089 --> 00:01:45,8
Oh, you're "worried about me"?

16
00:01:45,093 --> 00:01:48,5
And there's that "justice" of yours rearing its head!

17
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,0
I've made up my mind a long time ago.

18
00:01:53,023 --> 00:01:56,8
Staying up late is bad for the skin, so hurry up and leave.

19
00:02:09,054 --> 00:02:11,8
Shirou. How are your wounds?

20
00:02:12,038 --> 00:02:13,6
You came here to talk, right?

21
00:02:14,096 --> 00:02:16,1
Yeah...

22
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:19,0
No one knows about your secret, so don't worry.

23
00:02:28,052 --> 00:02:31,1
When you're hungry, it's easy to feel down.

24
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:34,4
You have to see things, feel things for yourself...

25
00:02:34,057 --> 00:02:37,4
...and find an asnwer that convinces you.

26
00:02:37,082 --> 00:02:39,3
What?
It's nothing.

27
00:02:39,045 --> 00:02:42,4
I was thinking how a thousand-year-old person is so different...

28
00:02:42,049 --> 00:02:44,4
Are you making fun of me?
Hehe~

29
00:02:45,012 --> 00:02:46,4
Thanks.

30
00:02:46,087 --> 00:02:47,9
I'm digging in.

31
00:03:01,063 --> 00:03:05,8
I'm about to go to the police to look into Yaba. What about you?

32
00:03:05,093 --> 00:03:08,2
I'm good today. I have something planned.

33
00:03:08,077 --> 00:03:12,8
Don't go near the cult. Or the Medical Center. Got it?

34
00:03:14,002 --> 00:03:16,4
I know, I know. See you later!

35
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:52,1
The slums!

36
00:03:57,011 --> 00:03:59,4
It should've ended up around here...

37
00:04:02,015 --> 00:04:03,4
Michiru!

38
00:04:03,086 --> 00:04:06,8
Whatcha up to?
I should be the one asking that.

39
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:07,9
What's all this?

40
00:04:08,024 --> 00:04:10,8
Mineral-ish Water!

41
00:04:11,075 --> 00:04:14,0
Using the water purifier I bought recently...

42
00:04:16,017 --> 00:04:18,5
You're still using that?

43
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:22,5
I do this and... here!

44
00:04:23,001 --> 00:04:26,8
Done! That's Mineral-ish Water!

45
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,7
Aaahhh! Trash-free water is amazing!

46
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:34,1
Wanna take a sip?

47
00:04:34,031 --> 00:04:35,6
I'll pass.

48
00:04:35,094 --> 00:04:37,8
I sell them for 10 yen each!

49
00:04:37,098 --> 00:04:41,9
It's great! I'll get rich in no time!

50
00:04:47,091 --> 00:04:49,5
There it is!

51
00:04:49,095 --> 00:04:52,0
Oh! That's the Ginrou-sama thing!

52
00:04:52,012 --> 00:04:54,3
I love the Silver Wolf Maiden!

53
00:04:54,066 --> 00:04:57,8
I've been changing thanks to Ginrou-sama!

54
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,3
I don't do things like pulling other people's flowers out...

55
00:05:01,046 --> 00:05:05,8
...or pull out other people's bicycle saddles and resell them anymore!

56
00:05:06,034 --> 00:05:08,5
Because Ginrou-sama is watching!

57
00:05:08,068 --> 00:05:10,8
Everyone in the slums says that.

58
00:05:13,014 --> 00:05:14,7
May you become a good beastman!

59
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:16,0
Is that okay, then?

60
00:05:16,014 --> 00:05:18,9
T-this is Mineral-ish Water!

61
00:05:19,006 --> 00:05:20,8
-ish! I'm not lying!

62
00:05:20,094 --> 00:05:22,3
It's business! Business!

63
00:05:22,078 --> 00:05:25,5
If "good beastmen" hear about this, they'll be disgusted.

64
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:28,4
Do you also like Ginrou-sama?

65
00:05:33,095 --> 00:05:36,7
Yeah... I like her.

66
00:05:41,063 --> 00:05:43,6
I found a 10-yen coin!

67
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:46,0
I gotta show it to everyone!

68
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:49,1
He hasn't changed a bit...

69
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,1
Before Yaba went out of control, there wasn't anything peculiar about him.

70
00:06:14,066 --> 00:06:18,7
That day, Yaba was acting like normal...

71
00:06:19,017 --> 00:06:21,6
...and Boris, the trainer for the cult came to visit...

72
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,6
Boris?

73
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:26,0
He said something about "teaching sinners about God".

74
00:06:26,017 --> 00:06:30,7
The jail was completely obliterated, and dangerous criminals broke out.

75
00:06:30,084 --> 00:06:34,2
No matter how many reports I make, it'll never be enough.

76
00:06:34,035 --> 00:06:35,6
I'd like to see Yaba's body.

77
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,1
Ah, it was transported to the Medical Center.

78
00:06:38,052 --> 00:06:41,3
To the Medical Center? The autopsy is a job for the police.

79
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:47,0
Obeying orders from above is also a job for the police.

80
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,8
Nazuna?

81
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,6
Nazuna!

82
00:07:32,049 --> 00:07:33,4
The Medical Center?

83
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:54,3
How are the results for that scan going?

84
00:07:54,047 --> 00:07:56,3
Ah, about that...

85
00:08:16,003 --> 00:08:16,8
Nazuna!

86
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,6
Nazuna! Nazuna!

87
00:08:22,033 --> 00:08:23,7
Nazuna!

88
00:08:23,087 --> 00:08:24,5
Michiru?!

89
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:29,4
Aaahhh... Are you okay?

90
00:08:33,022 --> 00:08:34,6
What are you doing?!

91
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,1
Entry is prohibited to unrelated parties!

92
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:40,1
Nazuna and I are plenty related!

93
00:08:42,093 --> 00:08:43,8
Michiru, no!

94
00:08:58,082 --> 00:09:00,0
Don't touch Nazuna!

95
00:09:02,062 --> 00:09:04,5
This damn brute...!

96
00:09:09,025 --> 00:09:12,3
Michiru... That's enough...

97
00:09:29,061 --> 00:09:31,0
Michiru!

98
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:34,5
Release her.

99
00:09:38,086 --> 00:09:40,7
What do you plan to do with Nazuna?!

100
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:43,0
If anything happens to Nazuna...

101
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:45,2
The cult will hear about it!

102
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:47,6
And I... I will...!

103
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:51,3
That habit of yours of being stubborn and jumping in...

104
00:09:51,067 --> 00:09:53,4
You don't change at all, huh.

105
00:09:56,076 --> 00:09:57,8
My apologies.

106
00:09:58,001 --> 00:10:01,3
I'm sure she mistook this as me being abducted.

107
00:10:01,047 --> 00:10:06,5
It's alright. Wanting to save your friend and acting recklessly because of that...

108
00:10:06,068 --> 00:10:08,7
I can't say I disapprove.

109
00:10:08,085 --> 00:10:11,9
Nazuna, you've got quite the friend.

110
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:16,8
You're Michiru, right? I've heard a lot about you from Nazuna.

111
00:10:17,053 --> 00:10:18,8
I know you.

112
00:10:18,095 --> 00:10:20,6
You're that admirable Sylvasta guy...

113
00:10:20,095 --> 00:10:23,3
Oh, what an honor.

114
00:10:23,045 --> 00:10:26,6
That's right. I am Alan Sylvasta.

115
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,1
I'm the representative of Sylvasta Pharmaceutics.

116
00:10:30,025 --> 00:10:33,7
What's going on? Why is Nazuna here?

117
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,9
I just came to take an MRI scan.

118
00:10:36,055 --> 00:10:38,4
MRI?

119
00:10:39,047 --> 00:10:41,9
She's been undergoing regular check-ups for a while...

120
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:43,9
...and letting us get some data out of it.

121
00:10:44,056 --> 00:10:47,1
I'm here on my own volition.

122
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,6
Would you go home?

123
00:10:49,014 --> 00:10:51,7
Well, since this is a peculiar occasion...

124
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:55,3
...we should let Michiru here into the loop as well.

125
00:10:55,044 --> 00:11:00,9
That's...
Leaving her in the dark with half-baked details could cause a lot of trouble for us in the future...

126
00:11:01,091 --> 00:11:04,4
I think Michiru has the right to know.

127
00:11:05,012 --> 00:11:07,4
About how she became a beastman...

128
00:11:09,091 --> 00:11:11,4
Alright.

129
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:12,9
Nazuna?

130
00:11:14,034 --> 00:11:18,1
Michiru, I ought to apologize to you.

131
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:22,9
The reason behind your beast form... is this Medical Center.

132
00:11:26,051 --> 00:11:33,5
You were both accidentally transfused a Beast Factor reagent extracted from a beastman.

133
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:46,9
In the drugs Yaiba and Mimura were trafficking...

134
00:11:47,028 --> 00:11:50,3
The Beast Factor reagent was mixed in by accident.

135
00:11:53,054 --> 00:11:57,6
Those were accidentally administered to both of you.

136
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,3
That's...

137
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:04,9
Yaba noticed the amount of packages didn't line up, so he desperately tried to track it down.

138
00:12:05,026 --> 00:12:08,1
As a result, he found out that Nazuna could transform into a beastman...

139
00:12:08,031 --> 00:12:10,7
...and quickly abducted and isolated her.

140
00:12:10,085 --> 00:12:15,4
But he only noticed you could also transform into a beastman...

141
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,0
...after you came to the city.

142
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:24,0
The real reason behind the bombing was so they could erase all data about the mixup.

143
00:12:24,066 --> 00:12:27,5
Because the development of the reagent was top secret.

144
00:12:27,066 --> 00:12:31,2
If it were discovered, no punishment for letting that slip would be enough.

145
00:12:31,087 --> 00:12:33,8
If only you weren't here...!

146
00:12:35,067 --> 00:12:38,7
Are you saying Nazuna and I are victims of your research?

147
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:41,3
That's horrible!
My apologies...

148
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:44,1
We're fully responsible for this.

149
00:12:44,047 --> 00:12:48,1
But it's alright. You can go back to being human.

150
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:54,6
We're developing a cure for the "beastman disease". It will be completed soon.

151
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:58,8
If you use that, you and Nazuna will be able to go back to normal.

152
00:12:58,098 --> 00:13:03,3
That's why I'm here to help Sylvasta.

153
00:13:12,087 --> 00:13:17,1
When I heard I was made into a beastman, I was shocked.

154
00:13:17,054 --> 00:13:20,4
But Sylvasta Pharmaceutics took all responsibility...

155
00:13:20,059 --> 00:13:24,6
...and they promised to make a cure for me to return to normal.

156
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:28,7
Until the cure is completed, I assigned a job...

157
00:13:28,084 --> 00:13:32,6
...to Nazuna, to instill hope into all beastmen.

158
00:13:32,072 --> 00:13:34,2
By transforming, that is.

159
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:44,1
Hold on! Didn't you oppose the cult coming to Animacity in the first place?

160
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:47,2
Yeah. I needed to do that.

161
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:51,2
To decrease beastmen's mental entropy...

162
00:13:51,037 --> 00:13:54,2
...the Silver Wolf Order is needed.

163
00:13:54,062 --> 00:13:56,7
E... Entropy...?

164
00:13:57,012 --> 00:14:00,4
Haven't you noticed since moving to Animacity?

165
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,8
Beastmen are easily driven by their emotions.

166
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,7
Their frustration builds up and they explode from little things, disturbing the peace.

167
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:13,6
To preserve their mental stability, we're using their faith in Ginrou.

168
00:14:13,076 --> 00:14:18,7
Facing a "god" makes their mental entropy decrease.

169
00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:21,0
Is that different from stress?

170
00:14:21,015 --> 00:14:27,7
However, being invited by religions created by the very humans who oppress beastmen... They won't believe in that.

171
00:14:28,024 --> 00:14:29,1
What about that?

172
00:14:29,024 --> 00:14:32,1
You were targeted but Nazuna saved you, didn't she?

173
00:14:32,024 --> 00:14:36,6
I had prior information that indicated I might be targeted.

174
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,8
I just used that to my advantage.

175
00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:43,0
We must put up a show in order for people to believe, after all.

176
00:14:43,017 --> 00:14:46,0
Having beastmen choose to believe on their own...

177
00:14:46,021 --> 00:14:49,5
...would lead to their mental entropy quickly decreasing.

178
00:14:50,001 --> 00:14:51,4
So it's stress...

179
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:54,9
Mental entropy... Do you understand?

180
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:00,2
You were fooling everyone?

181
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:03,1
It was a show!

182
00:15:03,031 --> 00:15:06,1
It's resulting in a more orderly Animacity.

183
00:15:06,065 --> 00:15:08,6
It would've been nice to know all this.

184
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:11,6
I told you I'm looking for a way to cure this disease, didn't I?

185
00:15:12,003 --> 00:15:14,4
You know it's top-secret.

186
00:15:14,053 --> 00:15:19,2
Only Boris and I know about this... There's no way we could've told an outsider like you, Michiru.

187
00:15:19,062 --> 00:15:22,2
The ones with this illness are you and me, Nazuna!

188
00:15:22,033 --> 00:15:24,6
Wouldn't that make that gross geezer an outsider?

189
00:15:24,075 --> 00:15:26,9
I told you he's not gross.

190
00:15:27,025 --> 00:15:30,6
He's around you 24/7, of course he's gross!

191
00:15:31,009 --> 00:15:32,8
Well, calm down.

192
00:15:32,093 --> 00:15:35,6
You're judging people based on appearances.

193
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,3
That applies to both of you.

194
00:15:37,081 --> 00:15:41,0
You saw Nazuna getting pulled into my car...

195
00:15:41,014 --> 00:15:42,6
...and assumed she was being abducted.

196
00:15:43,035 --> 00:15:45,6
But the truth was different, wasn't it?

197
00:15:46,036 --> 00:15:49,9
The truth lies in that which you cannot see.

198
00:15:51,057 --> 00:15:54,6
I'm taking responsibility and developing a cure.

199
00:15:55,012 --> 00:15:59,7
You can both return to your human selves. I promise.

200
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:03,5
Until then, would you help Nazuna out?

201
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:15,4
"Help"? What can I do?

202
00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:18,6
He means not to interfere in our business.

203
00:16:19,056 --> 00:16:22,3
"our"...

204
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:54,6
I told you not to approach the cult or the Medical Center.

205
00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:58,3
They said I can go back to being human.

206
00:18:02,028 --> 00:18:04,5
So it was a medical error?
Yeah.

207
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:08,3
But he apologized a lot...

208
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:11,2
...and he promised to develop a cure.

209
00:18:12,004 --> 00:18:14,2
Do you trust that?

210
00:18:14,034 --> 00:18:16,5
He's using you for his own benefit.

211
00:18:17,017 --> 00:18:20,5
You think that just because Alan is human, right?

212
00:18:20,068 --> 00:18:23,7
You distrust anything a human says, after all.

213
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:26,1
Your friend is a human too, right?

214
00:18:26,027 --> 00:18:29,3
She pretends she's Ginrou and tries to fool beastmen.

215
00:18:29,048 --> 00:18:30,9
That's how humans are.

216
00:18:31,056 --> 00:18:33,9
That's not true! Nazuna isn't like that.

217
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:38,3
She's lying about being Ginrou...

218
00:18:38,061 --> 00:18:41,9
...but she always said she wanted to be an idol.

219
00:18:42,057 --> 00:18:46,3
She wants to become an idol and have people fawn over her.

220
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:48,8
Well, there have been situations like that, but...

221
00:18:49,025 --> 00:18:56,8
...she really wants oppressed and sorrowful beastmen to have some hopes and dreams.

222
00:18:56,092 --> 00:18:59,7
That's why she works so hard as Ginrou.

223
00:18:59,084 --> 00:19:02,3
I think that's amazing.

224
00:19:02,051 --> 00:19:06,6
So I want you to overlook the fact that she's pretending to be Ginrou.

225
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:10,0
Did you enter their cult?

226
00:19:10,044 --> 00:19:14,7
Ah, no way. I can't believe in a counterfeit religion.

227
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:16,9
But I believe in Nazuna.

228
00:19:17,082 --> 00:19:22,2
I think she noticed that feeling hasn't wavered at all, after all this time.

229
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:26,8
Though the person in question won't ever say it out loud.

230
00:19:28,004 --> 00:19:29,9
Do you want to be a human again?

231
00:19:32,008 --> 00:19:33,9
Yeah, I want to.

232
00:19:34,033 --> 00:19:36,8
Once you go back, are you leaving Animacity?

233
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,9
I came to love this city...

234
00:19:40,005 --> 00:19:42,8
...but I do want to go back home.

235
00:19:44,055 --> 00:19:46,8
I see.
Yeah.

236
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:53,4
Leave it open.

237
00:19:54,006 --> 00:19:57,1
The wind is cold tonight. You will catch a cold.

238
00:19:57,032 --> 00:19:58,6
It's fine.

239
00:19:58,082 --> 00:20:00,2
That tanuki girl...

240
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,1
...will she finally stop coming?

241
00:20:04,053 --> 00:20:06,2
Boris.
Yes.

242
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:09,9
From now on, I'll leave my management to someone else.

243
00:20:09,095 --> 00:20:11,3
Eh...! Why is that?

244
00:20:11,087 --> 00:20:13,7
Because you're gross.
G... Gro...

245
00:20:14,021 --> 00:20:17,5
Also, entering my room without permission...

246
00:20:17,067 --> 00:20:19,4
...that's gross, so stop doing it.

247
00:20:20,071 --> 00:20:22,1
May you become a good beastman.

248
00:20:24,005 --> 00:20:27,1
May... you become a good beastman.

249
00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:38,1
She's a human, after all...

250
00:20:38,069 --> 00:20:40,6
Did you say someting?
No.

251
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:44,2
What will it be today?
I want to know the results from Yaba's autopsy.

252
00:20:44,032 --> 00:20:46,0
Why did he turn out like that?

253
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:48,9
I saw a change in his Beast Factor.

254
00:20:49,003 --> 00:20:50,0
Beast Factor?

255
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,7
I don't know the details yet, but...

256
00:20:52,087 --> 00:20:55,5
Once I know, I'll have a report made.

257
00:20:55,062 --> 00:20:57,2
Why in the Medical Center...

258
00:20:57,083 --> 00:21:01,5
It's frustrating, but the Medical Center has cutting edge technology.

259
00:21:01,067 --> 00:21:05,2
Aside from that, Alan isn't as bad of a human as you think he is.

260
00:21:05,068 --> 00:21:08,6
So everyone's siding with him now?

261
00:21:08,072 --> 00:21:12,4
I haven't met a single good human in my entire life.

262
00:21:12,085 --> 00:21:15,3
What? You're always meeting someone like that.

263
00:21:15,052 --> 00:21:17,4
Isn't Michiru a good human?

264
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:27,0
Thank you for making time in your tight schedule.

265
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,0
What's the urgent business?

266
00:21:29,066 --> 00:21:33,9
Animacity wouldn't have been established had it not been for your efforts.

267
00:21:34,004 --> 00:21:35,5
Prime Minister Shiramizu.

268
00:21:35,062 --> 00:21:38,3
That's why I have some advice.

269
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,5
Advice?

270
00:21:39,092 --> 00:21:43,4
I have something I want to lend to the Japanese government.
