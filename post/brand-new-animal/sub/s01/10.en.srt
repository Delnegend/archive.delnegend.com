Are you kidding me, Mari?!

4
00:01:05,094 --> 00:01:08,3
This cigar set I bought from you...

5
00:01:08,077 --> 00:01:10,7
...more than half of it is filled with carrots!

6
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,1
No matter how much of a horse you think I am...

7
00:01:13,032 --> 00:01:15,8
...carrots ain't a replacement for cigars!

8
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,7
Give me my money back!

9
00:01:17,082 --> 00:01:20,6
C'mon, I showed you the photo, didn't I?

10
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:23,0
Asking if this was okay.

11
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,8
You looked at this and agreed!

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,7
I'm not foolin' you or anything.

13
00:01:29,017 --> 00:01:32,7
If you get it, drop that horse face of yours and go home.

14
00:01:32,084 --> 00:01:34,4
See ya.

15
00:01:42,047 --> 00:01:43,5
What's with that...

16
00:01:45,023 --> 00:01:46,8
What's wrong, Mari?

17
00:01:46,094 --> 00:01:49,9
I don't know! He just went out of control.

18
00:01:50,011 --> 00:01:51,4
I'll leave this to you!

19
00:01:51,061 --> 00:01:54,5
I'm running away like a hare! (I'm a mink though!)

20
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:57,0
Shirou, that's...!

21
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,8
The same that happened to Yaba.
Then...

22
00:02:09,033 --> 00:02:10,7
Now!
Got it!

23
00:02:18,026 --> 00:02:20,7
Mayor! There's a rampaging beastman in the city...

24
00:02:21,034 --> 00:02:23,7
Oogami is dealing with it accordingly.

25
00:02:23,085 --> 00:02:25,8
Understood, I'll go as well.

26
00:02:27,085 --> 00:02:31,4
President Alan? I'm sorry, I'm a bit busy...

27
00:02:32,015 --> 00:02:34,9
I'm aware of it...

28
00:02:35,053 --> 00:02:36,9
...and we need to talk.

29
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:49,7
Can you deal with this...?
Yeah. I won't kill him this time.

30
00:03:02,026 --> 00:03:03,0
We did it!

31
00:03:14,015 --> 00:03:15,1
What's all this?

32
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,2
Shirou!

33
00:04:22,038 --> 00:04:23,5
I'm okay.

34
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,9
We're going after them.

35
00:04:50,062 --> 00:04:52,3
The Medical Center?

36
00:04:52,075 --> 00:04:54,7
They're definitely here.

37
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:58,2
It'll be dangerous from now on. You should go back...

38
00:04:58,042 --> 00:05:00,0
Hey! You should listen when...

39
00:05:00,021 --> 00:05:02,3
I can't accept you getting shot all the time...

40
00:05:02,046 --> 00:05:04,0
...and I wanna know what all that was.

41
00:05:04,051 --> 00:05:06,5
Besides, you're on edge.

42
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:09,3
You get worked up as soon as it's about Sylvasta.

43
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:12,4
Letting you go in alone is much more dangerous.

44
00:05:12,085 --> 00:05:16,2
Let's go. I've been here before, so I know how to sneak in.

45
00:05:33,004 --> 00:05:35,3
Didn't you know how to sneak in?

46
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:39,2
Oogami.

47
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:44,1
This is a medical facility. Would you refrain from acting violently?

48
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,5
Alan?

49
00:05:45,063 --> 00:05:46,9
Hello, Michiru.

50
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:50,3
Perfect timing. I have to ask you something.

51
00:05:50,051 --> 00:05:51,4
Of course.

52
00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:54,3
You guys. Lead the way.

53
00:06:00,077 --> 00:06:03,2
I didn't know they had this kind of facilities here.

54
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,1
It's odd.
What is?

55
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:07,7
There are only humans here.

56
00:06:07,086 --> 00:06:10,3
This Medical Center should be beastmen-centered.

57
00:06:10,045 --> 00:06:12,9
Is it the smell?
Yeah.

58
00:06:13,062 --> 00:06:16,4
I was going to recover the body in secret, but...

59
00:06:16,058 --> 00:06:18,6
...I didn't know you were taking care of it.

60
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:21,5
So those machines are the Medical Center's?

61
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:23,1
What are those anyways?

62
00:06:23,025 --> 00:06:25,3
Those are Engel Machines.

63
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:28,1
It's medical equipment to protect beastmen.

64
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,9
Medical equipment?
She was shot, you know.

65
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,2
My apologies for that.

66
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,1
They're meant to be used on rampaging beastmen.

67
00:06:36,056 --> 00:06:39,4
We tranquilized that horse beastman to protect him, too.

68
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,5
They probably mistook Michiru for a target.

69
00:06:42,094 --> 00:06:44,5
That was live ammo.

70
00:06:45,007 --> 00:06:50,1
They were quickly dispatched by a subordinate when I was absent, so that was an equipment mistake.

71
00:06:50,024 --> 00:06:52,3
I deeply apologize.

72
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:55,7
I will make sure this doesn't happen again.

73
00:06:55,087 --> 00:06:57,9
The rampaging beastman is being treated here.

74
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,4
More live experiments?

75
00:07:00,058 --> 00:07:02,6
That is unforgivable in Animacity.

76
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:06,1
Judging by your reply, you're ready to tear me apart.

77
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,7
That's the plan.

78
00:07:07,088 --> 00:07:09,4
Shirou! Calm down!

79
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:11,8
What are you trying to do in this city?

80
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,9
You won't talk your way out of this one.

81
00:07:14,043 --> 00:07:18,9
Alright. It'd be better if I explained everything to you.

82
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:22,1
We need samples from rampaging beastmen.

83
00:07:22,077 --> 00:07:25,1
I know this is rough, but there's no time.

84
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:27,4
Administer the prototype.

85
00:07:30,003 --> 00:07:30,9
What are you doing?!

86
00:07:31,028 --> 00:07:34,6
Could you pull back those teeth and claws for a moment?

87
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:37,9
I can't have you recklessly clawing at my throat.

88
00:07:38,062 --> 00:07:42,1
If things stay like they are, Animacity will be destroyed.

89
00:07:42,071 --> 00:07:44,3
Like Nirvasyl.

90
00:07:47,055 --> 00:07:49,1
You know about that city...?

91
00:07:49,063 --> 00:07:52,8
The general leading the soldiers back then...

92
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,3
...was Raymond Sylvasta.

93
00:07:56,068 --> 00:07:59,6
Sylvasta...
That's right.

94
00:08:01,006 --> 00:08:02,6
My ancestor.

95
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:14,9
Stop it. Do you plan on letting rage consume you and get Michiru involved?

96
00:08:15,032 --> 00:08:16,4
You bastard!

97
00:08:16,053 --> 00:08:19,0
I just want you to listen to me calmly.

98
00:08:19,058 --> 00:08:22,8
Oogami, you misunderstand.

99
00:08:22,096 --> 00:08:26,8
It wasn't the humans who targeted beastmen in Nirvasyl.

100
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,9
It's the opposite. Humans were targeted by beastmen and they protected themselves.

101
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:35,8
When the human military arrived, the beastmen were already killing each other!

102
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,3
That's ridiculous!

103
00:08:37,043 --> 00:08:40,1
Why do you think humans defeated the beastmen?

104
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:44,0
This was a thousand years ago. There were no guns or explosives!

105
00:08:44,014 --> 00:08:46,9
With dull blades, heavy shields and arrows...

106
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,9
Does that compare to the attacks of agile beastmen?

107
00:08:50,069 --> 00:08:53,9
Beastmen were fighting and hurting each other...

108
00:08:54,011 --> 00:08:56,1
...the humans just laid the final blow.

109
00:08:56,028 --> 00:08:57,8
Don't talk like you were there!

110
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,7
Then I'll ask you since you were there.

111
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:06,0
Aren't you reminded of something? I know you are a Nirvasyl survivor.

112
00:09:06,037 --> 00:09:08,2
...! Why do you...?

113
00:09:08,033 --> 00:09:10,8
I've looked into you before.

114
00:09:11,046 --> 00:09:12,6
That's not all.

115
00:09:12,076 --> 00:09:17,9
The story of a silver wolf looking for revenge has been passed down for generations, too.

116
00:09:18,034 --> 00:09:21,2
You gave up on that meaningless revenge, so you should know.

117
00:09:21,064 --> 00:09:25,5
Did humans really slaughter beastmen back then?

118
00:09:25,069 --> 00:09:28,2
Did beastmen really not target each other?

119
00:09:28,069 --> 00:09:30,8
Like Yaba did in a blind rage?

120
00:09:34,082 --> 00:09:37,1
That's... But...

121
00:09:39,062 --> 00:09:45,4
Originally, beastmen of the same kind were living scattered all around.

122
00:09:45,054 --> 00:09:48,9
They weren't used to living with different beastmen.

123
00:09:49,008 --> 00:09:52,8
The stress of having your own territory invaded by other species...

124
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,7
...unconsciously built up.

125
00:09:55,013 --> 00:09:58,5
Having that sort of mental shock in that state...

126
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:04,2
...activated a "switch" that overloaded their Beast Factor, and their violent instincts amassed.

127
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:07,9
That's the Beast Factor Breakout Syndrome...

128
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,4
...the "Nirvasyl Syndrome".

129
00:10:12,015 --> 00:10:15,6
I've analyzed the Beast Factor of the beastmen of this city.

130
00:10:15,074 --> 00:10:19,3
Their intracerebral aggressiveness values are rapidly increasing.

131
00:10:19,045 --> 00:10:23,4
If the beastmen population keeps increasing, they'll go overboard.

132
00:10:24,008 --> 00:10:27,7
I see, that's why you had the cult move...

133
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:30,8
What about the Mayor? Does she know about this?

134
00:10:31,025 --> 00:10:34,8
Of course, I talked to her. She agrees.

135
00:10:37,072 --> 00:10:40,8
A place where beastmen can live rightfully...

136
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:42,7
A peaceful world to live in...

137
00:10:43,022 --> 00:10:47,2
That's all I wished to create with this city, but...

138
00:10:48,035 --> 00:10:51,1
...was that all wrong?

139
00:10:51,027 --> 00:10:56,0
Have I been creating a beastman hell for the past 10 years?

140
00:10:56,019 --> 00:10:58,1
Are you agreeing with President Alan...?

141
00:10:58,061 --> 00:11:01,4
I checked the data from Sylvasta.

142
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:04,4
There are no flaws in Alan's theory.

143
00:11:04,058 --> 00:11:08,3
Contact Prime Minister Shiramizu immediately.
Understood.

144
00:11:10,058 --> 00:11:13,6
The reason behind the creation of this Medical Center in Animacity...

145
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:16,6
...is to create a vaccine for the Nirvasyl Syndrome.

146
00:11:17,025 --> 00:11:19,8
Because I can easily take samples from beastmen.

147
00:11:20,001 --> 00:11:22,7
Wait. The vaccine you're trying to create is...

148
00:11:23,014 --> 00:11:25,7
That's right. A vaccine to turn beastmen into humans.

149
00:11:26,056 --> 00:11:31,6
"Beast Factor Termination Vaccine". If we stop beastmen from transforming, the Nirvasyl Syndrome will not happen.

150
00:11:31,077 --> 00:11:35,5
That's the cure for my beastman disease?

151
00:11:36,077 --> 00:11:39,0
That's right.
No...

152
00:11:39,015 --> 00:11:42,0
So you're making beastmen reject the fact they're beastmen?!

153
00:11:42,086 --> 00:11:44,2
You filthy human!

154
00:11:51,066 --> 00:11:52,9
Shirou!

155
00:11:55,017 --> 00:11:58,6
They're tranquilizers. Please calm down a bit.

156
00:11:58,075 --> 00:12:02,1
All humans... are the same...

157
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:05,2
They all use brute force to control beastmen...

158
00:12:05,068 --> 00:12:08,1
If this keeps up, beastmen will start killing each other!

159
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,7
Are you okay with that?!

160
00:12:10,043 --> 00:12:14,5
Humans have no right... to decide that!

161
00:12:18,036 --> 00:12:19,3
Shirou!

162
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:23,3
That's surprising. Even that amount didn't work?

163
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:28,0
Starting Beast Factor Termination process.

164
00:12:28,053 --> 00:12:30,7
Alright. It's a success!

165
00:12:34,046 --> 00:12:36,3
Stop that! Stop!

166
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:38,0
Why are you stopping me?!

167
00:12:38,017 --> 00:12:41,4
I won't let humans create a drug to erase beastmen!

168
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:43,3
You saw it, didn't you?!

169
00:12:43,051 --> 00:12:45,7
This guy and Yaba both rampaged!

170
00:12:46,009 --> 00:12:49,2
Are you okay with everyone rampaging? Are you okay with slaughter?!

171
00:12:49,064 --> 00:12:53,2
Shut up! They'll be turned into humans! By humans!

172
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,8
How about staying alive?!

173
00:12:55,094 --> 00:12:59,4
If you destroy this, you'll be destroying everyone's chance of survival!

174
00:12:59,086 --> 00:13:01,4
Move!
I'm not moving!

175
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:03,9
Do you want a drug to make you human that badly?!

176
00:13:06,016 --> 00:13:08,7
You just want to go back to being human.

177
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:11,5
That's not...
You're a human after all.

178
00:13:11,066 --> 00:13:14,7
There's no way you'd get how a beastman feels!

179
00:13:15,058 --> 00:13:18,4
You're always like this! Deciding everything based on that!

180
00:13:19,008 --> 00:13:22,1
There's no way I can understand the feelings of the legendary Ginrou!

181
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:25,0
Is living a thousand years really all that?

182
00:13:25,022 --> 00:13:29,0
Haven't you just held a grudge against humans for the past thousand years?

183
00:13:29,035 --> 00:13:32,1
W... What did you say?!

184
00:13:38,023 --> 00:13:40,5
Don't move.
Mr. Tachiki...

185
00:13:40,065 --> 00:13:44,6
I received a report about a suspect rampaging at the Medical Center...

186
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:47,0
...but I can't believe it's you, Oogami.

187
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:49,0
It's a shame, but...

188
00:13:49,053 --> 00:13:51,9
...he's the one who destroyed all this.

189
00:13:52,008 --> 00:13:55,2
Oogami. Would you come to the station?

190
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:58,1
You're committing a damage to property crime.

191
00:13:58,058 --> 00:14:01,0
Do you think you can catch me that easily?

192
00:14:01,017 --> 00:14:03,3
I'm begging you to make it easy.

193
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:07,2
I don't want to be your enemy, but this is my duty.

194
00:14:07,072 --> 00:14:10,5
If you turn on the police as well, you're just a criminal.

195
00:14:10,084 --> 00:14:13,3
You'll be the same as those terrorists.

196
00:14:22,048 --> 00:14:24,1
Shirou...

197
00:14:24,086 --> 00:14:26,0
Let's go after him.

198
00:14:26,053 --> 00:14:29,3
It's best if we let the police handle this.

199
00:14:29,049 --> 00:14:33,4
But...
It's okay. He's a strong man.

200
00:14:33,087 --> 00:14:36,6
Once he calms down, I'm sure he'll understand.

201
00:14:38,025 --> 00:14:40,0
Michiru, thank you.

202
00:14:41,033 --> 00:14:44,8
You protected the vaccine machinery from him, did you not?

203
00:14:45,025 --> 00:14:49,1
It's the same as you saving the lives of many beastmen.

204
00:14:49,026 --> 00:14:51,3
You don't really need to thank me...

205
00:14:53,043 --> 00:14:55,0
Oh, right. Michiru.

206
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,2
I want you to give some advice to Nazuna.

207
00:14:58,035 --> 00:15:00,4
Nazuna?
Yeah.

208
00:15:00,056 --> 00:15:02,9
I entrusted her with a task as well, but...

209
00:15:03,006 --> 00:15:05,9
...I think she'll need your help.

210
00:15:06,007 --> 00:15:07,0
What's the task?

211
00:15:07,044 --> 00:15:10,4
It's something to help Animacity.

212
00:15:15,095 --> 00:15:18,3
To think you'd come get me.

213
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,8
The Mayor has something to tell you.
Figures.

214
00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:25,5
The Town Hall is being guarded by the police. Come with me.

215
00:15:29,088 --> 00:15:31,1
Thank goodness!

216
00:15:31,051 --> 00:15:34,3
See? Michiru came back home!

217
00:15:34,047 --> 00:15:35,6
Yeah.

218
00:15:35,072 --> 00:15:38,3
I've been praying to Ginrou-sama.

219
00:15:38,068 --> 00:15:41,8
The police came and said they were looking for Shirou...

220
00:15:42,002 --> 00:15:43,5
...and she was worried.

221
00:15:43,065 --> 00:15:46,7
There has to be a mistake! Where's Shirou?

222
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,0
Nazuna?

223
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:10,5
Huh. It shouldn't matter if you're a beastman or a human as long as you stay alive, right?

224
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:15,2
That's true, but Shirou doesn't even entertain that thought.

225
00:16:16,064 --> 00:16:18,8
Did you hear about the live from Alan?

226
00:16:18,097 --> 00:16:20,8
Live?
Yeah!

227
00:16:21,002 --> 00:16:24,6
Until the cure is done, to ease the minds of stressed beastmen...

228
00:16:24,073 --> 00:16:26,8
...the cult is holding a live event.

229
00:16:26,094 --> 00:16:29,7
It will be streamed all throughout Animacity!

230
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:34,7
I asked Alan if he could get you to be part of my staff.

231
00:16:34,082 --> 00:16:37,7
It will pretty much be my first live, after all.

232
00:16:37,087 --> 00:16:40,0
Let's think of a setlist together!

233
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:45,0
Nazuna, did you know about the Nirvasyl Syndrome?

234
00:16:45,012 --> 00:16:49,0
Yeah. Alan told me to keep that info from unrelated people...

235
00:16:51,034 --> 00:16:53,6
...but you're already involved.

236
00:16:53,076 --> 00:16:56,9
Besides, there's nothing else I'd be hiding from you.

237
00:16:57,005 --> 00:16:59,3
Really?
Probably.

238
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:01,4
If there is, I'll apologize, so spare me~

239
00:17:01,077 --> 00:17:04,6
What's that about? Well, that's fine.

240
00:17:04,073 --> 00:17:08,8
A live, huh... That's amazing, Nazuna! You're like a real idol now.

241
00:17:09,023 --> 00:17:12,3
That's right. I'll become a real idol.

242
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:22,0
We'll make this a success and save this city!

243
00:17:23,066 --> 00:17:25,2
Michiru!

244
00:17:25,037 --> 00:17:27,2
I made some tea... Whoa!

245
00:17:27,037 --> 00:17:29,4
Ah, no... I mean... This is...!

246
00:17:29,054 --> 00:17:32,9
Ginrou-sama! Why are you here?

247
00:17:33,005 --> 00:17:36,6
I have come to get closer to my followers.

248
00:17:36,076 --> 00:17:39,2
I will go wherever I'm needed.

249
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,7
That's a quick change.

250
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:43,9
A-ah, I see...

251
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:46,8
This girl has been through a lot recently...

252
00:17:47,002 --> 00:17:48,7
As expected of Ginrou-sama.

253
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:51,8
It is alright. I am sure she'll find her path.

254
00:17:51,098 --> 00:17:53,3
I will be leaving now.

255
00:17:53,044 --> 00:17:56,9
May you become a good beastman.
May you become a good beastman.

256
00:18:01,091 --> 00:18:04,4
Is Ginrou-sama really all that?

257
00:18:04,058 --> 00:18:05,7
Yeah...

258
00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:09,9
I can't believe it's such a young girl, though.

259
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,7
Ah, don't worry about those things.

260
00:18:13,084 --> 00:18:15,9
As long as Ginrou-sama is here...

261
00:18:16,009 --> 00:18:18,3
May you become a good beastman.

262
00:18:20,064 --> 00:18:23,1
You went overboard, Oogami.

263
00:18:23,022 --> 00:18:26,0
Do you know what Alan is trying to do?

264
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:29,7
He's trying to turn all beastmen into humans.

265
00:18:29,085 --> 00:18:32,4
I know.
Then why are you stopping me?

266
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:35,5
"I don't care about death as long as I'm a beastman"...

267
00:18:35,069 --> 00:18:37,6
...not all beastmen think like that.

268
00:18:37,078 --> 00:18:39,3
Even you...

269
00:18:39,045 --> 00:18:42,7
But I'll make sure it doesn't come to that.

270
00:18:43,074 --> 00:18:45,9
I'm dismantling Animacity.

271
00:18:46,045 --> 00:18:50,4
If beastmen start rampaging because the population is increasing...

272
00:18:50,054 --> 00:18:52,9
...then dispersing them is for the best.

273
00:18:53,042 --> 00:18:55,8
I will meet with Prime Minister Shiramizu tomorrow.

274
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,9
I'm going to request for beastmen to be accepted and distributed all across Japan.

275
00:19:00,034 --> 00:19:05,3
However, if a Nirvasyl Syndrome outbreak starts happening before then...

276
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:08,4
...then using the vaccine will be unavoidable.

277
00:19:08,089 --> 00:19:09,8
That's...!

278
00:19:18,061 --> 00:19:22,0
Alright. Do what you must in your own way.

279
00:19:42,076 --> 00:19:45,3
Where could he be...?

280
00:19:58,011 --> 00:20:01,0
What happened? I don't recall seeing rain today.

281
00:20:01,045 --> 00:20:06,2
It's none of your business, so get lost. I'm in a bad mood.

282
00:20:06,037 --> 00:20:09,4
Figured as much, since the police is looking for you.

283
00:20:09,062 --> 00:20:11,5
Get on, I'll give you a ride.

284
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,0
I don't need it.

285
00:20:13,067 --> 00:20:15,0
Don't say that.

286
00:20:15,021 --> 00:20:18,5
I heard you had a fight with Sylvasta.

287
00:20:18,096 --> 00:20:21,3
What did you find, Oogami?

288
00:20:21,051 --> 00:20:25,1
I know this city is becoming shadier every day.

289
00:20:25,026 --> 00:20:28,6
I wouldn't be fit to be The Family's boss if I didn't.

290
00:20:38,023 --> 00:20:41,5
I see. It is a rather urgent matter.

291
00:20:41,065 --> 00:20:45,5
I can't say humans and beastmen get along too well.

292
00:20:46,066 --> 00:20:48,4
Although it's an avoidable disease...

293
00:20:48,053 --> 00:20:51,7
If humans find out about it now, they'll needlessly become anxious.

294
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:56,2
I beg you to distribute beastmen as quickly and quietly as possible.

295
00:20:56,063 --> 00:20:58,6
I understand how you feel.

296
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:03,4
However, I can't let any beastmen leave Animacity.

297
00:21:05,084 --> 00:21:06,6
This is...

298
00:21:07,009 --> 00:21:10,8
I received information about the Nirvasyl Syndrome.

299
00:21:10,097 --> 00:21:12,6
I'm already taking measures.

300
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:16,1
Mayor Rose, I've been requested to protect you.

301
00:21:16,023 --> 00:21:17,2
Protect me?

302
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,0
Well, things should be going smoothly over there...

303
00:21:20,015 --> 00:21:22,6
...so just sit back and relax.

304
00:21:22,082 --> 00:21:24,6
Hold on a minute! Prime Minister!

305
00:21:27,024 --> 00:21:31,3
Thank you. I appreciate your cooperation, Prime Minister.

306
00:21:37,008 --> 00:21:38,3
Shirou?!

307
00:21:45,084 --> 00:21:49,7
Damn... That stubborn geezer...
