That's great! You can do it, Nazuna! Do your best!

Nazuna?

00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,8
Good morning, Mr. Gem!

11
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,2
Nice weather, isn't it?

12
00:02:50,033 --> 00:02:53,9
How is that room? It's way better than the rooftop, is it not?

13
00:02:54,042 --> 00:02:56,5
Yeah! Thanks!

14
00:02:57,088 --> 00:03:01,3
Mr. Gem, what's that big building over there?

15
00:03:01,043 --> 00:03:03,8
Hm? Ah, it's the Medical Center.

16
00:03:04,055 --> 00:03:06,5
Sylvasta Medical Center.

17
00:03:06,068 --> 00:03:11,0
It's under direct management of Sylvasta Pharmaceutics.
There's a laboratory and a hospital there.

18
00:03:11,031 --> 00:03:13,2
Sylvasta's...

19
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,0
I see... If I go there, I could ask about my disease...

20
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:29,3
H... Hey, what the hell are you doing?!

21
00:03:29,045 --> 00:03:31,0
You little... It won't open!

22
00:03:31,012 --> 00:03:33,2
Why? Hey, hang on, what is this?!

23
00:03:33,037 --> 00:03:36,0
Why?! Let me out! Hey!!

24
00:03:36,021 --> 00:03:37,0
Be quiet.

25
00:03:37,021 --> 00:03:39,0
Why?! It won't open...

26
00:03:39,096 --> 00:03:42,0
I finally understand that you were a human.

27
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:43,3
So what?

28
00:03:43,051 --> 00:03:45,2
Your existence is dangerous.

29
00:03:45,047 --> 00:03:47,2
Huh? Why do you say that?

30
00:03:47,064 --> 00:03:51,7
People would panic if they found out that a human can turn into a beastman.

31
00:03:51,085 --> 00:03:55,9
Don't go out until we find out the details. I'll be bringing you food.

32
00:03:56,006 --> 00:03:59,0
W-What are you talking about?! I really don't get you!

33
00:03:59,028 --> 00:04:02,4
Believe in me. I'll protect the peace of the beastmen.

34
00:04:02,061 --> 00:04:05,5
No, even if you say it all cool like that, I can't trust you!

35
00:04:05,066 --> 00:04:07,4
It's gross!

36
00:04:07,053 --> 00:04:11,3
Open up...! I'm going to the hospital...!

37
00:04:11,045 --> 00:04:12,7
No.

38
00:04:14,058 --> 00:04:16,4
One step outside and I'll kill you.

39
00:04:16,058 --> 00:04:19,5
S-So you don't care about my peace?

40
00:04:22,076 --> 00:04:25,8
Remodelling this early in the morning? Must be tough.

41
00:04:26,068 --> 00:04:27,6
Mayor.

42
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:31,1
It's... the Mayor?

43
00:04:31,068 --> 00:04:33,6
The bomber?
Yes.

44
00:04:33,081 --> 00:04:35,2
We received a report...

45
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,8
...from the police saying the Medical Center received a threatening letter.

46
00:04:39,094 --> 00:04:41,0
And earlier this morning...

47
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:44,3
A truck loaded with Sylvasta medicine was blown up.

48
00:04:44,061 --> 00:04:46,0
A bomb?

49
00:04:46,016 --> 00:04:49,8
Uh... It's my ears this time? Oh well.

50
00:04:50,037 --> 00:04:52,2
"If you have the money to make..."

51
00:04:52,037 --> 00:04:54,7
"...a beastmen hospital and use the latest equipment..."

52
00:04:54,087 --> 00:04:58,9
"...use it for the sake of humans" is what the culprit said.

53
00:04:59,004 --> 00:05:01,0
So it's those anti-beastmen again.

54
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,5
The police also tried to track the smell of the bombs, but...

55
00:05:04,072 --> 00:05:07,8
...because of the impact, the smell was severely muddy...

56
00:05:07,097 --> 00:05:10,1
...so they couldn't follow any trails.

57
00:05:10,064 --> 00:05:13,0
Your excellent sense of smell is way more...

58
00:05:13,018 --> 00:05:15,6
...reliable than the police investigation team.

59
00:05:16,002 --> 00:05:18,9
I beg you. Look for the bombs.

60
00:05:19,061 --> 00:05:22,0
There are people admitted to the Medical Center.

61
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:23,2
We must avoid a fight.

62
00:05:23,057 --> 00:05:28,9
If the hospital is blown up... I might not be able to recover from my disease!

63
00:05:29,003 --> 00:05:30,4
That's bad... Really bad!

64
00:05:32,016 --> 00:05:35,7
Help me, Mayor!

65
00:05:35,087 --> 00:05:38,0
That was a voice just now.
Nope.

66
00:05:40,029 --> 00:05:44,2
Help me! He trapped me here!

67
00:05:47,005 --> 00:05:49,9
It's Kuro. He recently remembered how to mimic.

68
00:05:54,006 --> 00:05:55,5
Move that.

69
00:05:58,027 --> 00:06:00,0
Oogami?

70
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:04,4
Mayor! This guy is responsible for abducting a woman!

71
00:06:04,061 --> 00:06:05,3
Hey!

72
00:06:05,049 --> 00:06:09,0
He said he'd kill me if I went outside! That's blackmail!

73
00:06:09,016 --> 00:06:11,9
It's for your sake and beastmen's sake.

74
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:15,4
You're Michiru Kagemori.

75
00:06:15,054 --> 00:06:17,9
Just looking at you, you're a splendid beastman!

76
00:06:18,037 --> 00:06:21,1
It's hard to believe you were a human until just recently.

77
00:06:21,058 --> 00:06:23,5
So... you knew?

78
00:06:23,063 --> 00:06:26,4
I have to know everything about Animacity.

79
00:06:26,059 --> 00:06:28,1
That's the mayor's duty.

80
00:06:28,059 --> 00:06:31,1
I see. It was Gran Grandma.

81
00:06:31,026 --> 00:06:34,1
Confidentiality is also part of my duties.

82
00:06:34,031 --> 00:06:35,3
Excuse me...

83
00:06:35,097 --> 00:06:39,3
Let me help with searching for the bombs.

84
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:40,5
Why?

85
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:44,1
Sylvasta Pharmaceutics have cutting edge technology, don't they?

86
00:06:45,002 --> 00:06:48,1
If that's the case, they might be able to cure my disease, right?

87
00:06:48,044 --> 00:06:50,4
We don't know if it's a disease yet.

88
00:06:50,053 --> 00:06:52,9
But it's true she used to be a human.

89
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:55,6
The chances of it being a disease aren't zero.

90
00:06:56,004 --> 00:06:58,6
In any case, letting her outside is dangerous.

91
00:06:58,075 --> 00:07:02,7
If anti-beastmen humans find out about her... Who knows what would happen?

92
00:07:03,008 --> 00:07:05,2
I don't want to stay put.

93
00:07:05,071 --> 00:07:09,5
All I did before coming here was hide and do nothing.

94
00:07:09,067 --> 00:07:11,8
Holing up in my room...

95
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:14,6
When I ran away, I kept hiding from the beastmen hunters...

96
00:07:14,072 --> 00:07:16,9
...and I finally made it into this town...

97
00:07:17,006 --> 00:07:20,4
..but living in the shadows again... I refuse to do that.

98
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,5
Look...

99
00:07:24,052 --> 00:07:28,6
We need more people. Let's let her help.

100
00:07:29,007 --> 00:07:31,4
You can take care of being Kuro's contact, right?

101
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:34,5
Contact?

102
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:38,2
You can't tell she was a human just by looking at her.

103
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:41,8
As long as she moves within Animacity, there shouldn't be a problem.

104
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,2
However, the fact that you were a human stays here.

105
00:07:46,063 --> 00:07:47,5
Got it.

106
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,3
Would you also let me drop the charges against keeping you in captivity?

107
00:07:52,051 --> 00:07:54,0
...Okay.

108
00:07:54,014 --> 00:07:55,3
Okay, here.

109
00:07:55,076 --> 00:07:58,8
A phone! It's been so long!

110
00:07:58,093 --> 00:08:01,9
If Kuro finds something, contact Oogami.

111
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:05,6
These are bomb fragments left on the scene.

112
00:08:08,061 --> 00:08:11,9
Sylvasta Pharmaceutics is part of a world-leading...

113
00:08:12,007 --> 00:08:13,9
company group, the Sylvasta Conglomerate.

114
00:08:14,082 --> 00:08:19,6
The mayor says humans have the same rights as beastmen...

115
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:22,5
...so Animacity can get big fundings.

116
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:24,9
There are lots of humans who dislike that.

117
00:08:25,042 --> 00:08:27,8
There are rumors that Sylvasta Pharmaceutics...

118
00:08:27,096 --> 00:08:30,7
..is collecting beastmen data and making a profit off of it.

119
00:08:30,084 --> 00:08:33,8
Not all beastmen are welcome there.

120
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:37,2
So why did you take the job?

121
00:08:37,035 --> 00:08:38,0
Huh?

122
00:08:38,014 --> 00:08:41,7
I thought you didn't move if it wasn't for beastmen's sake.

123
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:44,8
I can't refuse a request from the Mayor.

124
00:09:04,058 --> 00:09:07,1
It's Oogami. I located the bombs.

125
00:09:07,092 --> 00:09:11,6
There are six bombs. Let the bomb squad go look.

126
00:09:12,005 --> 00:09:13,3
You go to the Medical Center.

127
00:09:13,046 --> 00:09:14,7
The Medical Center too?

128
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:18,7
No, there are no bomb smells there, but just to be sure.

129
00:09:19,001 --> 00:09:22,3
The real target of the bombers must be the Medical Center, after all.

130
00:09:22,052 --> 00:09:24,8
Hold on, I'm going too!

131
00:09:25,056 --> 00:09:27,4
There are 6 bombs.

132
00:09:27,056 --> 00:09:28,6
Let's hurry up.

133
00:09:49,071 --> 00:09:51,7
Huh... Kuro?

134
00:09:52,004 --> 00:09:53,8
Ah, h-hold on!

135
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,8
Hurry up!

136
00:10:04,097 --> 00:10:06,3
Don't fret.

137
00:10:06,052 --> 00:10:10,4
The police are too busy dealing with the bombs.

138
00:10:10,065 --> 00:10:12,9
In any case, this is the last time!

139
00:10:13,011 --> 00:10:17,6
That's cold. You should see this as a good thing!

140
00:10:17,086 --> 00:10:21,5
A good thing? What are they up to?

141
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:28,3
Hey! Who's eavesdropping over there?!

142
00:10:28,046 --> 00:10:29,8
Ah, damn it!

143
00:10:30,017 --> 00:10:32,3
Who is it? Come out!

144
00:10:36,013 --> 00:10:38,0
Heh. Capture her.

145
00:10:40,084 --> 00:10:43,3
She saw us! She might've heard something.

146
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:46,8
Ya think we'd let a child like that run away?

147
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:51,8
However, I swear I've seen her before...

148
00:10:54,007 --> 00:10:55,8
Come on, pick up!

149
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,4
Alright, that's the last one.

150
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,0
It's her!
Her?

151
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,7
...! That's...!

152
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,4
I knew it! It's her!

153
00:11:18,067 --> 00:11:19,4
Yeah...

154
00:11:22,076 --> 00:11:25,8
Hey, kid. Why were you in such a place?

155
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:29,5
Uh... I got a bit lost...

156
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:33,2
Oh? Did you happen to hear something important?

157
00:11:36,002 --> 00:11:37,7
Gotta teach a good ol' lesson...

158
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,8
...to annoying kids like you.

159
00:11:44,091 --> 00:11:45,8
Stop that.

160
00:11:45,099 --> 00:11:47,3
Y... You're Oogami!

161
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:50,2
You bastard!
Die!

162
00:11:54,021 --> 00:11:58,0
Go. I won't kill you. Not today, that is.

163
00:11:58,042 --> 00:12:00,9
Ngh... We'll remember this!

164
00:12:01,038 --> 00:12:04,5
Thank god I made it. Kuro let me know.

165
00:12:04,068 --> 00:12:06,9
Damn it! I called you multiple times!

166
00:12:07,064 --> 00:12:10,3
I'm sorry. Why were those guys chasing you?

167
00:12:10,081 --> 00:12:15,9
So, I saw those shady guys sneaking in some luggage through the back of the Medical Center...

168
00:12:16,044 --> 00:12:17,9
Who are they?

169
00:12:18,011 --> 00:12:20,6
A gang.
A gang?

170
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:24,3
They were sneaking in some goods in cooperation with the staff...

171
00:12:26,099 --> 00:12:27,9
An explosion?!

172
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:32,2
You wait in the association!

173
00:12:32,037 --> 00:12:34,9
No way! If they blow it up I'll be in serious trouble!

174
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:36,4
It's dangerous!

175
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,6
Okay, I'll admit it then.

176
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:44,3
I was really a human... But right now, I'm a beastman.

177
00:12:45,022 --> 00:12:46,3
What are you saying?

178
00:12:46,097 --> 00:12:49,5
You'll protect all beastmen, right?

179
00:12:50,097 --> 00:12:52,7
Then protect me, too.

180
00:12:53,081 --> 00:12:56,4
Because I'm also a beastman.

181
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:59,9
...You're persuasive.

182
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:10,2
This is horrible.

183
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:12,6
Oh, Oogami.

184
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,7
This is the Medical Center Chief, Mr. Yaba.

185
00:13:16,008 --> 00:13:19,6
This is also the handiwork of those bombers, huh.

186
00:13:20,021 --> 00:13:23,8
The police is responsible for this, you weren't able to stop it!

187
00:13:24,063 --> 00:13:26,2
Let me investigate.

188
00:13:26,084 --> 00:13:30,3
He's an advisor who's helping with the investigation.

189
00:13:30,051 --> 00:13:31,8
Is that alright?

190
00:13:31,097 --> 00:13:33,6
Hm. Feel free.

191
00:13:39,065 --> 00:13:42,1
Oogami overlooking this, though...

192
00:13:43,015 --> 00:13:47,9
I efficiently tracked the bombs' smells, so why...

193
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,8
This is...

194
00:14:02,038 --> 00:14:04,2
Did you figure something out?

195
00:14:04,071 --> 00:14:07,0
There's no smell.

196
00:14:08,043 --> 00:14:11,3
Mimura, it's that girl! She came back!

197
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:13,0
What?

198
00:14:13,014 --> 00:14:15,7
If that's the case...
I got it.

199
00:14:20,031 --> 00:14:21,9
P... President...

200
00:14:22,006 --> 00:14:24,5
The Medical Center was blown up?

201
00:14:24,069 --> 00:14:25,9
What a scary world.

202
00:14:26,007 --> 00:14:30,2
Yes. The research data management section was blown up.

203
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:35,2
However, the hospital's data management is hosted in another building, so it's safe.

204
00:14:35,037 --> 00:14:37,2
I see. That's a relief.

205
00:14:37,091 --> 00:14:42,4
Restoring the place of the explosion is first priority. Do it at any cost.

206
00:14:42,054 --> 00:14:45,6
Make sure not to leave any traces of an incident.

207
00:14:46,055 --> 00:14:49,0
Not a trace, Mr. Yaba.

208
00:14:49,017 --> 00:14:50,8
...Understood.

209
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,8
What a pain.

210
00:14:56,043 --> 00:14:57,8
Chief Yaba.

211
00:14:58,031 --> 00:15:00,9
Can we make some questions?

212
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:02,4
What do you want?

213
00:15:02,061 --> 00:15:05,8
I'll make sure you take responsibility for this!

214
00:15:07,003 --> 00:15:09,1
We investigated the place of the incident...

215
00:15:09,032 --> 00:15:12,3
We couldn't confirm any traces of the culprit.

216
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:14,0
Are you avoiding me?!

217
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,8
It's not just the culprit.

218
00:15:15,099 --> 00:15:18,3
There wasn't a single smell at the scene.

219
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,8
That's impossible.

220
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:24,1
It's impossible to have all smell disappear under normal circumstances.

221
00:15:24,025 --> 00:15:28,2
You have to use a chemical to do such a thing, after all.

222
00:15:28,092 --> 00:15:31,3
Mr. Yaba... In this laboratory...

223
00:15:31,047 --> 00:15:33,9
You're able to create such a thing, isn't that right?

224
00:15:34,026 --> 00:15:35,5
That's ridiculous.

225
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:38,6
Are you doubting me to hide your own incompetence?!

226
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:42,6
I saw the staff here cooperating with a gang earlier.

227
00:15:43,002 --> 00:15:45,3
Doesn't that mean you're involved as well?

228
00:15:45,065 --> 00:15:49,8
You had bombers blow up the lab to erase the evidence...

229
00:15:50,024 --> 00:15:53,2
Hey, hey... Do you really trust what this guy's saying?!

230
00:15:57,041 --> 00:16:02,0
You can always reach the culprit if you follow the residual smell left on the scene.

231
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:06,3
Because there are no smell-less beastmen.

232
00:16:06,071 --> 00:16:08,4
But at the crime scene...

233
00:16:08,059 --> 00:16:12,0
There was a period where there were absolutely no traces of any smell.

234
00:16:12,084 --> 00:16:17,3
...And your hands are lacking any smell right now.

235
00:16:17,055 --> 00:16:20,4
Ever since the lab was blown up.

236
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:31,1
His smelling skills are adopted as evidence under the provisions of the Special Beastman Territory.

237
00:16:32,099 --> 00:16:36,8
Mr. Yaba, can we have a chat at the station?

238
00:16:43,062 --> 00:16:45,6
Shirou!

239
00:16:45,092 --> 00:16:46,9
Don't move!

240
00:16:47,004 --> 00:16:49,2
If you move, I'll strangle this kid to death!

241
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:55,3
Run, Mimura!

242
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,6
Chase him!

243
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:14,3
Your claws won't tear through my skin!

244
00:17:14,061 --> 00:17:18,0
You're covering up the case for your own benefit.

245
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:21,3
My bare hands are enough for such a cowardly man!

246
00:17:29,017 --> 00:17:31,6
To you who abandoned the pride of a beastman...

247
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,7
...that horn is useless!

248
00:17:33,088 --> 00:17:37,8
Stop it. I beg you! My horn... Anything but my horn...!

249
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,9
Let that kid go!

250
00:17:48,027 --> 00:17:49,3
Don't move!

251
00:17:49,048 --> 00:17:51,8
If you so much as move an inch, I'm dropping this kid!

252
00:17:52,036 --> 00:17:55,0
You can't escape if you do things like this!

253
00:17:55,015 --> 00:17:57,7
It's all your fault! If only you weren't here...

254
00:17:57,086 --> 00:18:00,0
...it wouldn't be this complicated!

255
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:05,7
If you value this kid's life, prepare a helicopter with one hundred million yen for me to escape!

256
00:18:06,012 --> 00:18:07,2
Don't be ridiculous!

257
00:18:14,025 --> 00:18:15,0
Kuro!

258
00:18:15,021 --> 00:18:17,5
Don't underestimate a chameleon's sight!

259
00:18:17,072 --> 00:18:20,5
If you do unnecessary things, I'll really kill this kid!

260
00:18:20,068 --> 00:18:22,4
Where's the money and he helicopter?!

261
00:18:22,055 --> 00:18:24,6
This dude is serious!

262
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:31,4
If I can extend my hands like before...!

263
00:19:09,069 --> 00:19:11,7
Shirou! Shirou!

264
00:19:12,081 --> 00:19:14,4
I'm alive.

265
00:19:14,057 --> 00:19:16,1
Would you move?

266
00:19:20,086 --> 00:19:23,4
Oogami! It's best if you don't move.

267
00:19:23,057 --> 00:19:25,5
Get some treatment at the Medical Center.

268
00:19:25,066 --> 00:19:27,6
No, I'm fine.

269
00:19:29,033 --> 00:19:31,3
Can you move?
Yeah.

270
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:33,3
Good grief.

271
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,0
Are you really okay?
I won't die.

272
00:19:39,042 --> 00:19:43,0
Uhm. Thank you for saving me.

273
00:19:43,018 --> 00:19:44,2
I promised.

274
00:19:44,089 --> 00:19:47,6
I'll protect all beastmen.

275
00:19:50,068 --> 00:19:52,7
Yaba and Mimura confessed.

276
00:19:52,098 --> 00:19:56,1
They were cooperating for embezzlement.

277
00:19:56,023 --> 00:19:58,7
Then they realized the higher-ups found out...

278
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:01,2
...and they blew up the data system of the Medical Center.

279
00:20:01,061 --> 00:20:05,3
They hired people to set up fake bombs...

280
00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:08,8
...so they could erase the embezzlement data.

281
00:20:08,099 --> 00:20:11,4
Is that really all?
What do you mean?

282
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:16,6
That Mimura guy's malice... It was stronger than that.

283
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:19,3
If only you weren't here...!

284
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:22,8
I mean, blowing up your own lab to protect yourself...

285
00:20:22,093 --> 00:20:24,3
It's really odd.

286
00:20:24,051 --> 00:20:28,1
That's how they try to cover up what's inconvenient for them.

287
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:29,6
Adults, I mean.

288
00:20:29,072 --> 00:20:32,1
Are you talking about me?
Who knows~

289
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:35,9
I'm sorry. I won't lock you up anymore.

290
00:20:38,002 --> 00:20:40,1
I mean, you were so worked up over it...

291
00:20:40,057 --> 00:20:43,0
I don't want to be put in the same bag as those guys.

292
00:20:43,015 --> 00:20:45,8
So don't go telling anyone else about your beastman disease.

293
00:20:46,028 --> 00:20:47,4
I know.

294
00:20:47,057 --> 00:20:50,7
Ms. Michiru, I'll search for a treatment for you.

295
00:20:52,025 --> 00:20:55,5
She's in charge of researching beastmen genetics.

296
00:20:55,071 --> 00:20:58,0
She also has the first PhD on it.

297
00:20:58,046 --> 00:21:00,8
I'm a politician now, though.

298
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,2
I have a good relationship with Sylvasta Pharmaceutics, so it's a good chance.

299
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:08,7
I had them make a backup for the Animacity establishment as well.

300
00:21:09,022 --> 00:21:10,6
I see.

301
00:21:10,081 --> 00:21:14,8
Be careful with Sylvasta Pharmaceutics. They're very fishy.

302
00:21:15,002 --> 00:21:15,7
Why?

303
00:21:16,014 --> 00:21:19,3
No reason. Just my nose telling me that.

304
00:21:19,065 --> 00:21:22,3
Ah, it's your... "wild intuition", eh?

305
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:25,3
Are you making fun of me?

306
00:21:25,049 --> 00:21:26,3
No waaay~

307
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,0
Gentlemen!

308
00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:34,7
Our research here is over.

309
00:21:35,012 --> 00:21:36,5
Are we moving?

310
00:21:36,067 --> 00:21:39,4
Yeah. I'm going, too.

311
00:21:39,054 --> 00:21:43,4
It's time I take a look at how the beastmen base is for myself.

312
00:21:44,055 --> 00:21:47,5
It's been ten years since Animacity was established, huh.

313
00:21:47,068 --> 00:21:49,9
What a big milestone.
