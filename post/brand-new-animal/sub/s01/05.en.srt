Last night's game ended on a 6-2 with Wild Calling taking the win...

4
00:01:05,052 --> 00:01:07,9
Night Runners, the losers' death count amounted to three.

5
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,4
In that game, the last remaining dodo beastman...

6
00:01:10,061 --> 00:01:14,6
...died from the double play, so dodo beastmen are officially extinct.

7
00:01:15,024 --> 00:01:16,4
Next up...

8
00:01:20,074 --> 00:01:23,4
Aren't you able to return to your human form?

9
00:01:23,054 --> 00:01:25,9
That's true... but changing into my human form...

10
00:01:26,008 --> 00:01:28,3
...I feel like I'm wearing heels all the time.

11
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,1
You know what I mean?
Not at all.

12
00:01:30,029 --> 00:01:33,3
It's more convenient to be in this form when needed.

13
00:01:34,092 --> 00:01:37,3
So being a tanuki is more convenient...

14
00:01:38,038 --> 00:01:40,3
Ms. Melissa!

15
00:01:40,047 --> 00:01:44,3
Are there no basketball circles or a basketball association in this town?

16
00:01:44,052 --> 00:01:45,5
Basketball?

17
00:01:45,064 --> 00:01:47,4
I wanna have a match!

18
00:01:47,056 --> 00:01:50,4
My body grows dull if I don't play, after all...

19
00:01:50,081 --> 00:01:53,1
Matches, huh... There are!

20
00:01:53,048 --> 00:01:55,6
Oh, really?

21
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:01,4
See? A match!

22
00:02:01,062 --> 00:02:04,2
This is baseball, though. It's no basketball...

23
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:07,6
Well, they both involve chasing a ball and running around...

24
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:09,7
...so they're not so different, are they?

25
00:02:11,017 --> 00:02:14,2
Hello to the 5-6 baseball fans of Animacity!

26
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:16,8
The pink flamingos are as cute as always!

27
00:02:16,097 --> 00:02:19,8
Bears, the bear team facing them, looking as foolish as always...

28
00:02:20,026 --> 00:02:22,5
...here to update their growing consecutive losses!

29
00:02:22,068 --> 00:02:25,5
Wow, everyone's playing in their beast form!

30
00:02:27,043 --> 00:02:32,0
Heeeeeey! Heeeeeeeeeeeeey!

31
00:02:32,015 --> 00:02:33,9
Heeeeeeeeeeeeeey!

32
00:02:34,002 --> 00:02:35,8
Alright...!

33
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:54,9
I-I-I... It's a miracle ball!

34
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:57,2
Ah! Damn it...

35
00:02:58,013 --> 00:03:01,4
Changing from attack to defense, the pink girls are defending now!

36
00:03:01,059 --> 00:03:03,0
Hit!

37
00:03:08,006 --> 00:03:09,0
Out~

38
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,7
For real?!

39
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:16,7
Hold on! Something just came out of that girl's feather, something pointy and stabby!

40
00:03:17,028 --> 00:03:18,2
So what?

41
00:03:18,036 --> 00:03:19,3
The hell are you?

42
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:24,2
You're one of those bitches who proclaim justice and tell on people! A justice bitch!

43
00:03:26,053 --> 00:03:29,7
Would you look at that, tanuki girl. We meet again.

44
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,2
Ah...
M-I-N-K.

45
00:03:31,033 --> 00:03:33,6
Not a weasel, but Mari the Mink.

46
00:03:33,075 --> 00:03:35,2
I didn't say anything yet!

47
00:03:35,063 --> 00:03:37,3
So who are you betting on?

48
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,1
Betting?

49
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:41,5
You still don't understand a thing, as always.

50
00:03:41,072 --> 00:03:45,5
Animacity's baseball is a complete fight to the death gambling game.

51
00:03:45,064 --> 00:03:49,0
They're beastmen who would kill if it means they win.

52
00:03:49,014 --> 00:03:53,7
It's gambling that makes spectators rejoice every time someone dies or wins.

53
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:56,6
Wining or losing, living or dying.

54
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:59,7
That's the baseball of Animacity.

55
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,8
You're kidding...

56
00:04:00,094 --> 00:04:02,8
Alright, it's time for the girls to attack!

57
00:04:03,024 --> 00:04:05,8
And the flamingo hits!

58
00:04:05,095 --> 00:04:07,4
Straight to the pitcher!

59
00:04:08,091 --> 00:04:10,1
It's a hit!

60
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:13,8
A direct hit to Winnie the Pooh, Bears' pitcher!

61
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:15,8
He's being carried on a stretcher!

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,7
Oh~ Without a pitcher, you can't go on!

63
00:04:18,088 --> 00:04:21,1
The bear team only has 9 people~

64
00:04:21,026 --> 00:04:22,6
Doesn't that mean we win?

65
00:04:23,017 --> 00:04:24,9
Coach!

66
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:28,7
Coach! C-o-a-c-h!

67
00:04:28,085 --> 00:04:32,6
Yes, nice, batting, a hole in one~

68
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:36,3
Pitcher change with that girl!

69
00:04:36,073 --> 00:04:37,8
Eh? Me?

70
00:04:38,002 --> 00:04:40,4
No no no...!
It's okay, don't worry.

71
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:42,3
Let's close up the gap!

72
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:44,3
Yeah!

73
00:04:44,049 --> 00:04:45,9
Change of pitcher for the Bears!

74
00:04:46,003 --> 00:04:49,7
No matter how you look at it, it's a newbie tanuki girl!

75
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:52,3
Even so...
Hey bitch!

76
00:04:52,062 --> 00:04:55,2
Yeah, you! Would you hurry up~?

77
00:04:55,037 --> 00:04:59,2
You're also a tanuki on top of being ugly, I feel so bad I'm about to cry!

78
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:02,9
But I have an appointment with a nail salon afterwards, so I have no time for sympathy~

79
00:05:03,007 --> 00:05:08,0
If you're not gonna throw, you might as well go back to Kachikachi-yama! How 'bout you make a mud boat as well~?

80
00:05:09,005 --> 00:05:11,6
Actually, you're all so ugly, I can't help but feel bad...

81
00:05:13,014 --> 00:05:17,8
Sneering at people, laughing about things you were born with and can't change...

82
00:05:18,031 --> 00:05:23,4
...putting labels on people and acting like you've already won!

83
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,2
Sexy strike~!

84
00:05:30,058 --> 00:05:32,2
For real?!

85
00:05:32,033 --> 00:05:36,5
An incredible miracle ball is born!

86
00:05:37,021 --> 00:05:38,0
Shit!

87
00:05:40,029 --> 00:05:41,4
Strike!

88
00:05:41,054 --> 00:05:42,3
Strike!

89
00:05:42,059 --> 00:05:43,5
Strike!

90
00:05:43,071 --> 00:05:44,5
Strike!

91
00:05:44,071 --> 00:05:45,5
Strike!

92
00:05:45,084 --> 00:05:48,3
Strike! Strike! Strike!

93
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:49,5
Batter out!

94
00:05:50,014 --> 00:05:51,4
We're almost at the end!

95
00:05:51,055 --> 00:05:53,8
The Bears might actually have a chance!

96
00:05:54,002 --> 00:05:56,3
The batter's the miracle ball tanuki girl!

97
00:05:56,073 --> 00:06:00,2
I have to make a mud boat in Kachikachi-yama, so~

98
00:06:00,035 --> 00:06:01,6
Would you hurry it up~?

99
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:03,4
Damn you!

100
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,2
Hit~!

101
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,9
She got it!

102
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,9
She got it! What a surprise!

103
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,4
A turnaround victory for the Bears!

104
00:06:20,071 --> 00:06:23,1
Oogami, have you ever tried baseball?

105
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:24,1
No.

106
00:06:24,059 --> 00:06:27,2
What about baseball gambling?

107
00:06:27,034 --> 00:06:31,0
I want you to find evidence of the growing baseball gambling in the city.

108
00:06:31,018 --> 00:06:35,9
Flip from The Family is in charge of the gambling. That's the unspoken rule, isn't it?

109
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,1
It's hard to deal with that.

110
00:06:39,014 --> 00:06:43,4
Dodo beastmen went extinct yesterday, due to baseball.

111
00:06:44,044 --> 00:06:48,4
What sort of beastmen will go extinct next thanks to baseball, I wonder?

112
00:06:48,065 --> 00:06:52,2
We don't have any money♪

113
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:56,0
But we don't have any dreams either♪

114
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:59,2
But if it's about desires♪

115
00:06:59,037 --> 00:07:03,5
We have more than plenty♪

116
00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:06,7
It's a bit cramped, but come in!

117
00:07:07,096 --> 00:07:10,9
Whoa, it's really cramped.

118
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:14,6
Our water supply was cut so I brought water from the park.

119
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,1
Here you go.

120
00:07:16,031 --> 00:07:18,3
I have a request for you.

121
00:07:18,043 --> 00:07:21,2
Please become the pitcher for the Bears!

122
00:07:21,035 --> 00:07:23,4
We beg you!

123
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:27,2
We beg you!

124
00:07:27,036 --> 00:07:29,1
H-hold on!

125
00:07:29,024 --> 00:07:30,6
Look, I'm not even a bear!

126
00:07:30,095 --> 00:07:33,2
Raccoons are also welcome!

127
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,7
We don't discriminate against types of bears.

128
00:07:37,008 --> 00:07:39,2
I'm really glad we won today!

129
00:07:39,033 --> 00:07:42,0
We've never won other than by default.

130
00:07:42,021 --> 00:07:44,7
With you here, we could actually win the championship!

131
00:07:45,025 --> 00:07:46,5
Championship...

132
00:07:46,071 --> 00:07:49,9
I really can't play baseball. I'm sorry.

133
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,1
I'm really sorry.

134
00:07:59,068 --> 00:08:01,6
It was a short-lived dream...

135
00:08:01,098 --> 00:08:04,0
If we don't have a pitcher, we can't play.

136
00:08:04,048 --> 00:08:06,5
Baseball is all we have, too...

137
00:08:06,081 --> 00:08:10,3
Being born here means muddy water for life...

138
00:08:10,049 --> 00:08:12,4
For life...

139
00:08:13,032 --> 00:08:15,5
Okay, I get it! I'll do it!

140
00:08:17,066 --> 00:08:19,9
However, absolutely no killing!

141
00:08:20,004 --> 00:08:21,5
Eh? Why?

142
00:08:21,087 --> 00:08:24,8
I'll play baseball but I won't participate in a killing game.

143
00:08:25,033 --> 00:08:27,2
Okay, no killing, but what about hurting?

144
00:08:27,042 --> 00:08:28,9
No.
Twisting a finger?

145
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,8
No.
Cutting nails?

146
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,9
Not even a hangnail?

147
00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:35,7
No, no, I said no!!

148
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:39,8
Hello to the poverty-stricken and people with free time.

149
00:08:39,093 --> 00:08:41,3
Today's baseball match:

150
00:08:41,064 --> 00:08:46,5
The uneasy-looking Bears who spent all their luck of their lives in the last match to turn it around...

151
00:08:47,006 --> 00:08:50,7
...and the heavy-weight stars of the baseball gambling world, the Buffalos!

152
00:08:50,086 --> 00:08:51,9
Alright, play ball!

153
00:08:52,078 --> 00:08:54,8
The poor, foolish Bears are attacking!

154
00:08:56,066 --> 00:08:59,6
An unusually sluggish ball... They got it!

155
00:08:59,074 --> 00:09:02,1
Running against each other... First base, safe!

156
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:05,7
The Bears coach is making signs! They're pretty easy to understand!

157
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:06,8
Hey, they're catching on!

158
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,2
The Buffalos' defense at all once...!

159
00:09:09,042 --> 00:09:11,2
Wow, it was really a bunt.

160
00:09:11,034 --> 00:09:12,4
Easily out!

161
00:09:12,088 --> 00:09:15,3
He's signing for a bunt again! Is he serious?

162
00:09:15,084 --> 00:09:18,0
Or is it a sophisticated trap?

163
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,3
It's a bunt.

164
00:09:20,047 --> 00:09:23,1
Out! Stew and bead and bears! Stupid bears~

165
00:09:23,052 --> 00:09:24,6
Their fourth batter is...

166
00:09:24,081 --> 00:09:26,6
...the famous tanuki girl!

167
00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:28,8
Another see-through sign!

168
00:09:28,094 --> 00:09:31,0
Is he being exceedingly helpful?

169
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,9
It's the tanuki woman's gorilla swing!

170
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,8
A long hit! The bulls are chasing it!

171
00:09:42,045 --> 00:09:44,3
The tanuki gorilla girl is fast!

172
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:49,4
It's like she has cheetah legs!

173
00:09:50,071 --> 00:09:52,4
The bulls are throwing it back home!

174
00:09:52,071 --> 00:09:55,5
Who's faster, ball or cheetah? Ball or cheetah? Cheetah or ball?

175
00:09:55,067 --> 00:09:56,6
Ball or cheetah!

176
00:09:59,043 --> 00:10:00,2
Safe!

177
00:10:00,085 --> 00:10:04,1
Wow, who would've thought the poor, worn-down Bears would win?

178
00:10:04,031 --> 00:10:07,8
Like throwing money away, it's a win with no profit for anyone!

179
00:10:09,081 --> 00:10:11,5
You were supposed to lose, right?

180
00:10:13,036 --> 00:10:15,0
The profits for today!

181
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:25,3
Who would bet on such a weak team for baseball and fighting like the Bears?

182
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:31,2
If baseball's popularity goes down, our business goes down with it. That would be a problem, wouldn't it?

183
00:10:31,042 --> 00:10:34,5
Next time... Next time we'll definitely lose!

184
00:10:34,084 --> 00:10:37,5
Next time we'll drop you into the ocean!

185
00:10:43,014 --> 00:10:44,9
What were you doing in that shop?

186
00:10:45,035 --> 00:10:47,6
I was eating pizza, obviously.

187
00:10:47,077 --> 00:10:50,1
I'm looking for proof on baseball gambling.

188
00:10:50,023 --> 00:10:51,2
Would you testify?

189
00:10:51,035 --> 00:10:54,4
You can't keep on living if you defy The Family.

190
00:10:54,077 --> 00:10:58,2
Even if you hang around them, they'll just turn you into food.

191
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,2
For us beastmen...

192
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,1
...to make a living out of baseball, this is the only path to take.

193
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,4
You're on the right field today.

194
00:11:11,054 --> 00:11:13,1
And you're the pitcher.

195
00:11:13,025 --> 00:11:14,4
Eh, me?

196
00:11:14,054 --> 00:11:18,0
Coach, Michiru is our ace! Michiru should be the pitcher!

197
00:11:18,017 --> 00:11:19,0
That's right!

198
00:11:19,034 --> 00:11:21,0
Shut up! I'm the coach here!

199
00:11:21,022 --> 00:11:23,3
So you better obey me!

200
00:11:25,035 --> 00:11:27,4
I can't be the pitcher!

201
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,6
You'll be okay. We'll all protect you.

202
00:11:29,073 --> 00:11:33,0
If we win this one, the finals are next! You wanna win the championship, right?

203
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:35,0
Yeah!
Let's get this win!

204
00:11:35,015 --> 00:11:36,1
Yeah!

205
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:47,1
This is Dante, your new teammate!

206
00:11:47,028 --> 00:11:49,4
They say he's the first beastman player.

207
00:11:50,066 --> 00:11:53,9
We don't accept beastmen in this hotel.

208
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:56,8
Beasts should go to the zoo!

209
00:11:56,096 --> 00:11:58,7
Beasts should go outside.

210
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:01,5
Beasts don't need a bench, do they?

211
00:12:04,005 --> 00:12:05,0
Goddamn beast.

212
00:12:05,055 --> 00:12:07,7
Hurry up and die, you goddamn beast.

213
00:12:28,099 --> 00:12:31,7
The pitchers for the Bears today is Arai Rascal!

214
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,0
I don't think you can win even by using an oven glove.

215
00:12:35,017 --> 00:12:36,9
Because his rivals are...

216
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,5
...the strong tiger group, Tigers!

217
00:12:43,076 --> 00:12:46,2
It's oooooooout... of the playfield!

218
00:12:46,034 --> 00:12:47,9
No one's chasing it! They won't make it!

219
00:12:49,026 --> 00:12:50,3
There she is!

220
00:12:50,051 --> 00:12:52,8
The cheetah dash of the unwavering tanuki girl!

221
00:12:53,027 --> 00:12:58,2
She's using the sad nature of animals who chase moving things fully in her favor!

222
00:12:58,036 --> 00:13:00,6
Ah, almost there! She's so close!

223
00:13:00,077 --> 00:13:01,9
...Whoa, no way!!

224
00:13:02,057 --> 00:13:03,4
That fool...

225
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,7
Nice catch!

226
00:13:05,086 --> 00:13:08,0
And just like that, the Bears take the win!

227
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,7
An immense profit of a hundred yen to ten thousand yen!

228
00:13:10,099 --> 00:13:13,4
The eels are replaced by the Bears in popularity!

229
00:13:13,054 --> 00:13:16,6
The finals are finally next!

230
00:13:19,054 --> 00:13:20,9
Hey, gorilla tanuki.

231
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:23,9
I recall you promising not to use your powers in front of people.

232
00:13:24,065 --> 00:13:27,0
Don't get cocky. What happens if someone finds out?

233
00:13:27,022 --> 00:13:28,3
I mean, yeah...

234
00:13:28,051 --> 00:13:30,6
If anyone finds out about your abilities...

235
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:34,1
The town might as well disappear before you get the chance of curing it.

236
00:13:34,023 --> 00:13:37,2
Those Bears... They're a bit dumb and useless, but...

237
00:13:37,035 --> 00:13:40,4
...they love baseball. That's the first time I've ever met people like that.

238
00:13:41,036 --> 00:13:45,8
It's like I forgot about my beastman disease as soon as we started playing baseball...

239
00:13:45,095 --> 00:13:48,4
You're okay with forgetting about it?
Not at all...

240
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:52,0
...but ever since coming to this city...

241
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:56,9
...no, ever since getting this beastman disease, this is the first time I've had any fun.

242
00:14:02,025 --> 00:14:03,4
Help!

243
00:14:05,046 --> 00:14:08,6
Good news! The Bears' popularity is increasing.

244
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,8
"They're cute, like an unruly child", they say.

245
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:14,6
If you lose the next match, I'm willing to forget and forgive.

246
00:14:15,043 --> 00:14:19,9
If you defy me, you'll become fish food.

247
00:14:31,087 --> 00:14:33,0
I give up...

248
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:37,2
Where did I go wrong to end up with a life like this...?

249
00:14:38,021 --> 00:14:41,0
I'll die either way...

250
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,8
Hello to all gambling addicts.

251
00:14:43,096 --> 00:14:45,7
We've finally come this far.

252
00:14:46,013 --> 00:14:48,8
The finals for the Animacity Baseball League begin now!

253
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:52,1
The once foolish but now the star of the slums, the Bears...

254
00:14:52,055 --> 00:14:56,7
versus the kill-before-killed, butchering vermin corps, Killer Animals!

255
00:14:56,085 --> 00:14:58,6
If ya don't wanna die...

256
00:14:59,014 --> 00:15:02,2
Go back home and suck on some honey, little cubs.

257
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,4
Play ball!

258
00:15:05,027 --> 00:15:07,2
It's the tanuki girl, full of motivation!

259
00:15:07,065 --> 00:15:10,9
The mad dog is using a cracked bat, a super bat!

260
00:15:11,028 --> 00:15:12,8
The tanuki throws either way!

261
00:15:14,058 --> 00:15:18,0
There it is! The shotgun batting!

262
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:27,5
Ah! Huh? Huh?

263
00:15:28,096 --> 00:15:31,0
It's a series of rough plays!

264
00:15:31,026 --> 00:15:33,3
As expected of Animal Killers!

265
00:15:37,001 --> 00:15:39,4
Three out! The Bears are showing no resistance.

266
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,3
Such a lethargic baseball!

267
00:15:41,077 --> 00:15:43,9
Nngh... Coach!

268
00:15:44,002 --> 00:15:45,1
...He's gone!

269
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,6
Hey, what's wrong, everyone?

270
00:15:46,073 --> 00:15:47,6
Nothing much...

271
00:15:47,073 --> 00:15:49,6
Aren't you hiding something from me?

272
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:57,4
I-I-It's not like we're hiding the fact that we'll get money if we lose.

273
00:15:57,062 --> 00:15:58,4
Are you dumb?!

274
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,2
What do you mean?

275
00:16:00,058 --> 00:16:05,0
If you lose against the Killer Animals, we will give you this.

276
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:08,3
Hold on! Are you fixing the game?!

277
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,6
I dunno if we can win...

278
00:16:10,076 --> 00:16:12,9
...but we can easily lose.

279
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:15,2
Wasn't it your dream to win the championship?

280
00:16:16,043 --> 00:16:20,0
Getting your sight clouded by money and easily throwing away your dreams...

281
00:16:20,018 --> 00:16:21,5
How stupid can you be?

282
00:16:21,093 --> 00:16:23,2
We're stupid either way!

283
00:16:23,035 --> 00:16:27,2
We've been poor since we were born, and we'll keep being poor!

284
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,8
What's wrong with getting some money to rise up from a hellhole like that?!

285
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:53,0
This is Saotome.

286
00:16:53,017 --> 00:16:56,5
What?! The money from the safe was stolen?!

287
00:16:56,064 --> 00:16:58,0
Are you stupid?!

288
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,7
All the money from the gamblers was in there!

289
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:02,0
You goddamn fool!

290
00:17:02,014 --> 00:17:03,9
The money we bet was stolen?!

291
00:17:04,006 --> 00:17:05,7
What will happen with the money I bet?!

292
00:17:06,006 --> 00:17:07,0
Give it back!

293
00:17:07,015 --> 00:17:09,4
Who would watch baseball with no money involved?!

294
00:17:10,015 --> 00:17:13,0
What happened? The venue is bustling with energy!

295
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:15,5
The match has come to a halt!

296
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:30,9
The match isn't over yet!

297
00:17:33,088 --> 00:17:36,4
Are you running with the tail between your legs?

298
00:17:37,047 --> 00:17:39,5
Are you that afraid of losing?

299
00:17:41,022 --> 00:17:43,1
Don't be cowards!

300
00:17:44,052 --> 00:17:49,1
This town's baseball is all about winning, losing, living or dying, isn't it?!

301
00:17:49,065 --> 00:17:52,5
If that's the case, then go ahead and fight...

302
00:17:52,065 --> 00:17:54,5
...fair and square, with all your might!

303
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:03,4
With this one shot♪

304
00:18:03,099 --> 00:18:07,5
We'll turn it all around♪

305
00:18:07,066 --> 00:18:11,1
We Bears♪

306
00:18:11,025 --> 00:18:14,7
Are the star of the bears♪

307
00:18:15,096 --> 00:18:17,6
Let's close the gap!

308
00:18:18,005 --> 00:18:19,0
Yeah!

309
00:18:20,034 --> 00:18:23,6
You got a nice ball there, don't you, tanuki girl?

310
00:18:23,076 --> 00:18:29,2
If you manage to dead-ball me, I'll sue you and make society a living hell for you!

311
00:18:29,065 --> 00:18:30,9
Of course!

312
00:18:31,011 --> 00:18:33,4
We don't do killing games here.

313
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:35,6
We play baseball!

314
00:18:35,094 --> 00:18:39,0
Would you look at that! The match continues!

315
00:18:42,045 --> 00:18:43,9
You...

316
00:18:44,016 --> 00:18:45,8
Please! Let me go!

317
00:18:45,099 --> 00:18:49,5
It's a hit! Will it go through?

318
00:18:49,062 --> 00:18:51,3
They made it! It's a home-run!

319
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:54,0
The Bears are cornered by one point!

320
00:19:11,065 --> 00:19:13,7
What a development! Will they turn it around?

321
00:19:14,011 --> 00:19:16,9
This has become an unprecedented, historical baseball match!

322
00:19:17,003 --> 00:19:20,5
People from all over the city are gathering around to see the match for themselves!

323
00:19:21,011 --> 00:19:24,2
There's a one-point difference. Killer Animals are in the lead!

324
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:26,4
What? C-c-c-coach?!

325
00:19:26,062 --> 00:19:28,6
Where were you until just now?!

326
00:19:28,075 --> 00:19:31,5
Singing again? I don't wanna bunt!

327
00:19:31,062 --> 00:19:33,4
Huh? Do it?

328
00:19:33,058 --> 00:19:36,8
Just do it? Give it your all?

329
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:38,8
Do your goddamn best!

330
00:19:39,026 --> 00:19:42,3
The game starts now! Let's get this win!

331
00:19:42,084 --> 00:19:46,1
Whoever it was, I'll find them and kill them!

332
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,7
I found it.

333
00:19:50,014 --> 00:19:51,1
That's yours, isn't it?

334
00:19:51,031 --> 00:19:53,2
So you're the thief!

335
00:19:53,035 --> 00:19:54,8
Are you mocking us?!

336
00:19:58,015 --> 00:20:01,1
I was just nice enough to return it to its owner.

337
00:20:01,024 --> 00:20:04,2
Or would you rather I report the money I found to the police?

338
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,4
W-why did you bring it?

339
00:20:07,087 --> 00:20:11,2
I'm also betting. I love baseball.

340
00:20:16,071 --> 00:20:18,9
That's Michiru Kagemori.

341
00:20:19,005 --> 00:20:21,6
She's definitely shapeshifting into weird forms.

342
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,3
I see. Very interesting.

343
00:20:24,043 --> 00:20:26,4
Game set!

344
00:20:26,055 --> 00:20:28,3
Killer Animals take the win!

345
00:20:30,043 --> 00:20:35,0
I never thought losing would be this painful...!

346
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,3
You did great, Bears!

347
00:20:36,036 --> 00:20:39,2
The losing Bears are being received with a warm applause!

348
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,4
There hasn't been a match like this in Animacity until now, has there?

349
00:20:42,053 --> 00:20:48,0
What a moving final match! A final good game!

350
00:20:48,016 --> 00:20:52,2
Thank you Bears! The stars of the slums, Bears!

351
00:21:02,051 --> 00:21:04,0
This is your reward.

352
00:21:04,042 --> 00:21:07,6
So you follow your instructions next time.

353
00:21:10,076 --> 00:21:12,9
Sorry, but I refuse.

354
00:21:13,006 --> 00:21:17,1
I don't wanna gamble. I wanna play baseball.

355
00:21:19,098 --> 00:21:23,2
I couldn't find any evidence of baseball gambling.

356
00:21:23,069 --> 00:21:25,2
It seems it'll take some time...

357
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:27,4
...to change this city.

358
00:21:31,074 --> 00:21:33,0
Michiru!

359
00:21:34,021 --> 00:21:39,0
I bought a tool to make us better at baseball thanks to the money we got, with a lifetime payment plan!

360
00:21:39,013 --> 00:21:40,7
Yay!

361
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:41,9
Come on, you fools!

362
00:21:42,063 --> 00:21:44,3
Return that!

363
00:21:44,051 --> 00:21:46,3
Eh? Why?

364
00:21:46,043 --> 00:21:50,0
Heh... Having fun...?
