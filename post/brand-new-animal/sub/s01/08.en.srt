1
00:00:25,052 --> 00:00:29,2
Yes, it's about whether we should allow the cult to stay.

2
00:00:29,073 --> 00:00:31,9
Well, we have no choice.

3
00:00:32,003 --> 00:00:34,7
After the uproar from the public...

4
00:00:34,086 --> 00:00:38,0
...if we don't accept the cult, a riot will be inevitable.

5
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:40,5
I was saved by them myself.

6
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,2
There's no reason to oppose them.

7
00:00:44,054 --> 00:00:48,3
However... the amount of people who showed up was unexpected.

8
00:00:48,046 --> 00:00:52,3
Around 5,000 people were confirmed to be there.

9
00:00:52,042 --> 00:00:55,5
They're distributed all over Animacity.

10
00:00:55,068 --> 00:00:57,3
Must be rough for you.

11
00:00:57,047 --> 00:00:59,6
Well, hang in there.

12
00:01:00,089 --> 00:01:02,0
What's the situation?

13
00:01:02,018 --> 00:01:05,4
The Beast Factor deactivator has stabilized.

14
00:01:05,056 --> 00:01:06,6
Just one more step.

15
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,4
Good. Keep it up.

16
00:01:12,069 --> 00:01:16,0
Shall we make one final verification?

17
00:01:16,099 --> 00:01:21,9
♪～

18
00:02:11,092 --> 00:02:16,9
～♪

19
00:02:17,055 --> 00:02:20,7
Leader!
Guru!

20
00:02:20,089 --> 00:02:24,6
It's barely been 3 days since the cult moved into that building...

21
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:27,6
That's Ginrou-sama for you.

22
00:02:28,035 --> 00:02:32,8
The power of faith is strong, as they say.

23
00:02:57,017 --> 00:02:58,0
Nazuna!

24
00:03:01,084 --> 00:03:02,9
Nazuna!

25
00:03:05,043 --> 00:03:08,4
Would you look at that, you can fly too.

26
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:09,8
Were you hiding it?

27
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,3
No! Yesterday was a first for me.

28
00:03:13,048 --> 00:03:15,5
You're the one who didn't tell me you could fly.

29
00:03:15,098 --> 00:03:18,2
Do I have to tell you everything?

30
00:03:18,036 --> 00:03:20,4
That's not what...

31
00:03:20,082 --> 00:03:21,7
Whatever!

32
00:03:22,028 --> 00:03:24,8
I can't believe you moved right in front of me.

33
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:27,5
Huh? Boris decided that by himself.

34
00:03:28,012 --> 00:03:31,3
Aside from that, don't tell anyone about my identity.

35
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:34,8
The fact I'm a human must stay a secret.

36
00:03:34,096 --> 00:03:36,8
I told you I'm not gonna tell anyone.

37
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,3
But I mean, Nazuna, are you...

38
00:03:39,026 --> 00:03:41,8
...are you okay with this?

39
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:45,0
I'm not Nazuna.

40
00:03:51,048 --> 00:03:53,1
Déesse Louve.

41
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:57,0
I'm not Nazuna. I'm Ms. Déesse Louve.

42
00:04:02,036 --> 00:04:06,4
What language is that? I can't remember that...

43
00:04:16,013 --> 00:04:17,7
Where did you go?

44
00:04:17,088 --> 00:04:21,4
To Nazuna's... though she's "not Nazuna" now, apparently.

45
00:04:21,059 --> 00:04:22,7
Did you go see her?

46
00:04:23,047 --> 00:04:25,5
I just stumbled upon her.

47
00:04:25,072 --> 00:04:27,7
Why? Is that bad?

48
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,4
No.

49
00:04:34,064 --> 00:04:37,3
Uhm... can I help you?

50
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:40,4
I have an investigation on a falcon beastman we caught.

51
00:04:41,045 --> 00:04:42,4
Are you coming?

52
00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:46,6
I think you'd want to know who made the request.

53
00:04:47,003 --> 00:04:49,7
Are you inviting me?
Yeah.

54
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,8
Really?

55
00:04:51,025 --> 00:04:52,9
It's okay if you don't want to.

56
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:56,0
I do! I'm coming!

57
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:02,3
Must be a tough task to teach a sinner.

58
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:06,3
Sinners are the exact people who need to be taught by God.

59
00:05:06,047 --> 00:05:07,7
That much is obvious.

60
00:05:11,043 --> 00:05:13,8
He was the chief for the Medical Center...

61
00:05:13,098 --> 00:05:15,6
He was caught in an embezzlement.

62
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:19,8
I don't think he'll misbehave, but be careful.

63
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,5
I don't believe in Ginrou.

64
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:28,5
So that's the kind of person you are.

65
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:32,7
Have I seen you before?

66
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:36,0
You can't tell now, can you? Not with this form.

67
00:05:36,046 --> 00:05:37,6
What?

68
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:40,8
Let's expose your sin.

69
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,4
I assume you planned on getting away with it...

70
00:05:44,001 --> 00:05:48,8
...but if the truth came out, President Alan wouldn't just let it slide, would he?

71
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,6
Y-you...

72
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,0
Who are you?

73
00:06:00,023 --> 00:06:01,3
That's...

74
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:04,1
The trainer from the cult.

75
00:06:07,028 --> 00:06:09,7
Ya-Yaba, what's wrong?

76
00:06:10,016 --> 00:06:11,1
Are you okay?

77
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:21,2
Oh, Michiru's here, too?

78
00:06:21,033 --> 00:06:23,9
Have you gotten used to this city?

79
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:27,9
Yeah, I guess...
Oh, you're slurring a bit.

80
00:06:29,026 --> 00:06:30,9
Inspector! Yaba is breaking out!

81
00:06:38,094 --> 00:06:40,1
That's Yaba?!

82
00:06:40,031 --> 00:06:42,6
He's completely different from before!
Yeah.

83
00:06:44,094 --> 00:06:47,1
You have permission to fire! Do it! Do it!

84
00:06:55,054 --> 00:06:58,0
Damn it... Why is he so out of control?!

85
00:06:58,066 --> 00:07:00,0
I'll stop him.

86
00:07:00,054 --> 00:07:02,8
What?
The building is on fire...

87
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,5
Yes. The outbreak is in progress. The hypothesis is correct.

88
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:09,0
I won't let you rage any more!

89
00:07:09,047 --> 00:07:12,0
Seize him at any cost!

90
00:07:13,047 --> 00:07:14,9
He broke through the fence!

91
00:07:14,097 --> 00:07:17,8
At this rate, he'll make it to the city!

92
00:07:24,098 --> 00:07:25,8
What?!

93
00:07:30,028 --> 00:07:31,5
Shirou!

94
00:07:31,086 --> 00:07:33,9
It's okay, this is nothing...

95
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,7
But, your arm...!

96
00:07:41,004 --> 00:07:42,0
It fixed itself!

97
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:49,7
Oogami having this much trouble, though...

98
00:07:50,063 --> 00:07:53,3
If that thing makes it to the city... we'll be in big trouble!

99
00:07:58,089 --> 00:08:01,0
What are you doing?!
I'll take care of this!

100
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:04,3
I'll take him somewhere with...

101
00:08:04,048 --> 00:08:06,4
...no people...!

102
00:08:06,077 --> 00:08:07,9
Don't be stupid! Just run!

103
00:08:08,011 --> 00:08:09,1
Shut up!

104
00:08:09,065 --> 00:08:11,9
Don't think you can do everything alone!

105
00:08:12,036 --> 00:08:16,4
I'll help whenever I can...!

106
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,1
If that's the case... Show me!

107
00:08:32,001 --> 00:08:33,5
Put more force into it!

108
00:08:35,001 --> 00:08:37,8
More force... Then...

109
00:08:37,097 --> 00:08:40,1
...bigger wings!

110
00:08:42,098 --> 00:08:44,8
T-they picked it up!

111
00:08:45,044 --> 00:08:47,1
Stop moving!

112
00:08:47,031 --> 00:08:48,9
You damn...!

113
00:08:49,073 --> 00:08:50,6
To the wharf!

114
00:08:50,073 --> 00:08:52,8
There shouldn't be any people there!
Got it!

115
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,5
You're moving again...!

116
00:08:59,091 --> 00:09:02,0
Drop him!
At this height?!

117
00:09:02,016 --> 00:09:04,7
I don't care, hurry! I'll be fine!

118
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:06,0
Got it!

119
00:09:23,072 --> 00:09:26,6
We did it!
Somehow...

120
00:09:29,081 --> 00:09:31,0
...! Get down!

121
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,5
Sh... Shirou...

122
00:09:40,053 --> 00:09:43,7
Ngh... I'm fine... Run...

123
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:51,3
S-Shirou!

124
00:09:51,075 --> 00:09:52,8
I'm fine...

125
00:09:52,096 --> 00:09:55,3
You can't say that with such a wound! We should run!

126
00:09:56,097 --> 00:09:59,0
We can't leave that guy like that...

127
00:09:59,055 --> 00:10:01,6
That's my responsibility.

128
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:10,1
S... S... Stop it!

129
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:15,6
Run...!

130
00:10:36,084 --> 00:10:39,1
I did it!
Shirou, run!

131
00:10:58,053 --> 00:11:01,1
There's no other way...

132
00:11:30,002 --> 00:11:31,4
Ginrou...?

133
00:11:31,077 --> 00:11:33,7
I mean... Shirou?!

134
00:11:34,036 --> 00:11:35,4
Stay back.

135
00:12:06,097 --> 00:12:08,5
Shirou!

136
00:12:10,002 --> 00:12:12,4
A-an ambulance!
Stop it.

137
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:16,4
I'll... be alright...

138
00:12:19,057 --> 00:12:20,7
Oogami!

139
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:23,2
Mayor! Why are you here?

140
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,5
Inspector Tachiki called me.

141
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:27,9
Uh... Shirou is...!

142
00:12:28,008 --> 00:12:29,9
He will be okay.

143
00:12:30,004 --> 00:12:32,4
Take him to the car.
Understood.

144
00:12:36,092 --> 00:12:38,9
She found out...

145
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,1
I see...

146
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,6
He finally calmed down...

147
00:12:51,014 --> 00:12:54,1
The wound is closing, so he's gonna be fine.

148
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,2
That wasn't just a wound...

149
00:12:56,035 --> 00:12:58,3
He's really immortal, huh.

150
00:12:58,048 --> 00:13:01,5
I'm glad you didn't get any major wounds.

151
00:13:01,069 --> 00:13:03,0
It's thanks to Shirou.

152
00:13:04,036 --> 00:13:07,4
Who... What is he?

153
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:08,9
Shirou is Ginrou?

154
00:13:09,066 --> 00:13:11,8
That's your friend, isn't she?

155
00:13:11,099 --> 00:13:16,6
Don't play dumb, please. I heard Shirou mutter "She found out" just earlier.

156
00:13:17,021 --> 00:13:21,3
Nazuna is a fake Ginrou. You know that, don't you?

157
00:13:22,005 --> 00:13:22,8
Correct.

158
00:13:23,034 --> 00:13:26,8
Is Shirou the real Ginrou?

159
00:13:26,093 --> 00:13:28,8
What will you do with that information?

160
00:13:32,001 --> 00:13:36,0
I... I don't know anything about Shirou.

161
00:13:36,044 --> 00:13:38,2
I never tried to know him, either.

162
00:13:38,073 --> 00:13:44,0
It's probably already decided that Shirou and I are different...

163
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:46,7
Because he's a beastman and you're a human?

164
00:13:47,099 --> 00:13:50,4
I somehow felt like I could hate Shirou...

165
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:53,2
...because he hates humans.

166
00:13:53,037 --> 00:13:55,8
That sort of prejudice is...

167
00:13:56,029 --> 00:13:59,6
...But I'm exactly the same.

168
00:14:00,025 --> 00:14:04,3
...I thought Shirou and I were different because he's a beastman...

169
00:14:05,059 --> 00:14:08,6
When I turned into a beastman, I was scared.

170
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:13,8
That's probably because I didn't know anything about beastmen.

171
00:14:14,056 --> 00:14:19,4
That's why... I wanna know more about Shirou.

172
00:14:21,006 --> 00:14:22,6
Alright.

173
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:27,9
A Ginrou with wings, huh...

174
00:14:28,036 --> 00:14:30,7
That's very godly indeed.

175
00:14:31,028 --> 00:14:36,7
But that's just to make the imitation look more gaudy and appealing.

176
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,0
Imitation?

177
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,6
Shirou Oogami is the real Ginrou.

178
00:14:42,075 --> 00:14:44,3
For the last thousand years.

179
00:14:44,042 --> 00:14:45,9
T-thousand years?!

180
00:14:46,034 --> 00:14:48,5
Has he been living for a thousand years then?!

181
00:14:48,072 --> 00:14:49,6
Correct.

182
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,6
He doesn't look that old, though...

183
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,3
At first sight, at least.

184
00:14:54,043 --> 00:14:57,9
Apparently he stopped aging as soon as he became Ginrou.

185
00:14:58,035 --> 00:14:59,9
He became Ginrou?

186
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:03,6
It's not like Oogami was Ginrou since the beginning.

187
00:15:05,069 --> 00:15:07,9
It's a long story.

188
00:15:10,095 --> 00:15:13,9
About a thousand years ago, in the very east of Europe...

189
00:15:14,007 --> 00:15:16,2
There was a city called Nirvasyl.

190
00:15:16,033 --> 00:15:18,8
It was a beastmen-only city...

191
00:15:18,095 --> 00:15:21,6
...like our city, Animacity.

192
00:15:22,042 --> 00:15:27,3
He was living there, like a regular wolf beastman.

193
00:15:27,088 --> 00:15:30,7
At the time, beastmen and humans had trades...

194
00:15:30,084 --> 00:15:35,3
...and friendly relationships even between them.

195
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:37,7
But one day...

196
00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:39,9
...suddenly, without any warning...

197
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:43,5
...the human military attacked Nirvasyl.

198
00:15:49,044 --> 00:15:52,0
His own kind was slaughtered...

199
00:15:56,037 --> 00:15:58,0
...and he himself was slain, too...

200
00:16:12,063 --> 00:16:15,9
His body was thrown away like countless others...

201
00:16:16,005 --> 00:16:17,5
...and left to rot.

202
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:25,6
At that moment, something peculiar happened.

203
00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:51,1
There's no clear reason as to why it happened.

204
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:54,6
But the blood of all 2,000 Nirvasyl brethren was...

205
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,8
...what gave him an immortal body.

206
00:16:57,097 --> 00:17:00,1
He believes so, as well.

207
00:17:00,031 --> 00:17:01,2
That's...

208
00:17:01,093 --> 00:17:04,0
He obtained the power of Ginrou...

209
00:17:04,014 --> 00:17:07,4
...he went in search for the general who killed his kind...

210
00:17:07,052 --> 00:17:11,2
...and in his search, he killed countless human soldiers.

211
00:17:11,078 --> 00:17:15,7
However, he couldn't find the general he was looking for.

212
00:17:27,021 --> 00:17:29,6
When he felt the emptiness left by revenge...

213
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:33,5
...that's when he became the protector of beastmen.

214
00:17:33,088 --> 00:17:37,2
Sometimes protecting them from human oppression...

215
00:17:37,034 --> 00:17:40,6
...and sometimes being the guide for the new world.

216
00:17:40,072 --> 00:17:43,1
And that became the legend of Ginrou...

217
00:17:43,077 --> 00:17:46,6
When we first met...

218
00:17:47,006 --> 00:17:50,3
...was around the final years of World War II.

219
00:17:52,027 --> 00:17:56,3
Wanting to see if they could turn beastmen into biological weapons...

220
00:17:56,045 --> 00:17:58,7
...countries like that existed as well.

221
00:17:58,086 --> 00:18:02,9
In those countries, beastmen were captured and put in concentration camps...

222
00:18:03,012 --> 00:18:05,2
...and were repeatedly experimented with.

223
00:18:16,055 --> 00:18:20,6
That's when we were saved by Ginrou.

224
00:18:22,085 --> 00:18:27,8
But when he saw the disaster resulting from the experiments beastmen were put through...

225
00:18:28,029 --> 00:18:31,8
...he slaughtered all humans in the research facility.

226
00:18:32,073 --> 00:18:37,6
From then on, he's never once changed into his Ginrou form.

227
00:18:39,078 --> 00:18:45,4
He's afraid of his own power, so he keeps Ginrou sealed away.

228
00:18:45,095 --> 00:18:49,8
So please don't tell anyone he's Ginrou. Do you understand?

229
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:53,1
I don't get it.

230
00:18:54,038 --> 00:18:56,3
I don't really get it.

231
00:18:56,042 --> 00:19:00,0
So I'll just keep things as they are.

232
00:19:00,018 --> 00:19:03,9
To me, he's Shirou Oogami.

233
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:08,8
That cold and unfriendly person who desperately fights to protect Animacity.

234
00:19:09,002 --> 00:19:13,0
Hehe. Right. That's okay.

235
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:16,0
No... That's perfect.

236
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,4
Yeah.

237
00:19:20,061 --> 00:19:23,8
Since I survived, I aimed to become a scientist.

238
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:29,6
I figured humans couldn't be the only ones to know about beastmen. Beastmen should know, too.

239
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,4
This little guy was at that lab, too.

240
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:36,4
He's a crow who got his body reconstructed.

241
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,4
That's why he's been living for so long.

242
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:44,2
He was saved along with me.

243
00:19:45,026 --> 00:19:48,4
Uhm... I'll keep it quiet.

244
00:19:48,089 --> 00:19:52,6
I'll keep the fact that Shirou is Ginrou to myself.

245
00:19:53,023 --> 00:19:54,2
But...

246
00:19:55,023 --> 00:19:58,0
...the fact that Ginrou is actually real...

247
00:19:58,019 --> 00:20:00,7
...I have someone I want to tell that to.

248
00:20:02,052 --> 00:20:03,9
Please.

249
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,3
What would he say...?

250
00:20:07,045 --> 00:20:09,1
I don't mind.

251
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:11,3
Shirou!

252
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:14,3
Go.

253
00:20:15,092 --> 00:20:17,0
Yeah!

254
00:20:21,051 --> 00:20:22,5
Are you sure?

255
00:20:22,072 --> 00:20:25,0
If we stopped her, she'd talk either way.

256
00:20:25,047 --> 00:20:30,1
Heh. Seems like you're starting to understand her.

257
00:20:30,022 --> 00:20:32,5
She's really good at manipulating me.

258
00:20:35,023 --> 00:20:39,2
I'll go, too. I have something I'm interested in.

259
00:20:49,033 --> 00:20:50,9
Michiru...

260
00:21:00,096 --> 00:21:02,7
Well, if it isn't the Mayor.

261
00:21:02,084 --> 00:21:05,6
Show me the scan data.
B-but...

262
00:21:05,076 --> 00:21:09,0
I don't mind.
Ah, but...

263
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:13,0
You know, don't you? Before she became the Mayor...

264
00:21:13,018 --> 00:21:16,3
...she was the first person ever to research the Beast Factor.

265
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:21,2
She was the first beastman to get a PhD.

266
00:21:22,023 --> 00:21:25,7
W-what's this shift in the Beast Factor?!

267
00:21:25,086 --> 00:21:28,3
That's right. We're investigating that as well.

268
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:32,6
I trust you'll contact me as soon as there is any progress?

269
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:34,1
With pleasure.

270
00:21:34,058 --> 00:21:38,2
Having the top of Sylvasta Pharmaceutics here is reassuring.

271
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:41,6
If anything happens, I trust you'll handle it immediately.

272
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,6
That is why I'm here.

273
00:21:47,009 --> 00:21:50,3
That's right. That's exactly why.
