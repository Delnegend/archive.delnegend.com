1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,2
Michiru!

2
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,2
Michiru... This can't be...!

3
00:00:14,023 --> 00:00:15,3
Oogami...

4
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:28,9
Hey...

5
00:00:29,067 --> 00:00:31,6
Hey... Michiru!

6
00:00:57,018 --> 00:00:58,8
Can you do that again?

7
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:01,3
Your howling is amazing.

8
00:01:01,034 --> 00:01:02,9
Mi... Michiru!

9
00:01:03,025 --> 00:01:05,2
Ouch...!
Oh! Sorry!

10
00:01:09,096 --> 00:01:11,5
Are your wounds okay?

11
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,4
Yeah... but you didn't bite my gorilla arm, so it was dangerous.

12
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,0
Thank you. You saved me.

13
00:01:17,085 --> 00:01:18,8
Thank you, Michiru.

14
00:01:19,029 --> 00:01:20,4
Oogami!

15
00:01:20,093 --> 00:01:22,9
The Mayor! And Pinga!

16
00:01:23,015 --> 00:01:24,3
To the city hall!

17
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,0
Get on!

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,6
As promised, Animacity is on lockdown.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,9
This should ensure the safety of all citizens, right?

20
00:01:40,028 --> 00:01:42,2
Don't worry, Prime Minister.

21
00:01:42,056 --> 00:01:44,8
The beastmen will die as such before long.

22
00:01:45,035 --> 00:01:49,4
Japan would be the first in the world to resolve the beastman problem.

23
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:56,9
So, Oogami had an outbreak like everyone else, but as soon as he bit you, he returned to normal?

24
00:01:57,006 --> 00:01:58,0
That's right.

25
00:02:04,095 --> 00:02:05,7
Look at this.

26
00:02:06,003 --> 00:02:09,4
This is a sample from Yaba's blood that I found stored away.

27
00:02:09,071 --> 00:02:12,2
I'll mix it in with Michiru's blood.

28
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,5
Her Beast Factor is rewriting other Beast Factors.

29
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:24,6
The rampaging Beast Factor is returning to normal. In other words, Oogami returning to normal is thanks to Michiru.

30
00:02:25,025 --> 00:02:30,4
The Beast Factor in both of you has the ability to change forms at will.

31
00:02:30,075 --> 00:02:35,5
If we apply that to other Beast Factors, it will result in the neutralization of the beast form rampage.

32
00:02:35,064 --> 00:02:38,6
If we make a serum, we can cure the Nirvasyl Syndrome.

33
00:02:38,061 --> 00:02:39,2
Really?!

34
00:02:39,045 --> 00:02:42,1
The Japanese Government will not come to our aid.

35
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,8
This is our last chance.

36
00:02:44,022 --> 00:02:45,4
To the Medical Center.

37
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:47,3
We can synthesize a serum there.

38
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,5
We gotta hurry.
I'm not going.

39
00:02:50,098 --> 00:02:54,0
If stress is relieved, an outbreak won't happen, right?

40
00:02:54,037 --> 00:02:56,9
Are you going to the city?! It's too dangerous.

41
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:01,7
I lied about me being Ginrou to everyone who believed in me.

42
00:03:02,003 --> 00:03:04,5
If I don't do something, I can't forgive myself.

43
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,4
I'll help the girl, too.

44
00:03:08,053 --> 00:03:10,8
Leave the serum to me.
Okay.

45
00:03:11,042 --> 00:03:12,8
I'll protect the city.

46
00:03:13,017 --> 00:03:14,1
Thank you.

47
00:03:15,033 --> 00:03:17,8
When we're done...
We make a speech!

48
00:03:18,025 --> 00:03:19,1
Let's go.

49
00:03:28,085 --> 00:03:31,1
I'll take some blood from you. Get ready.

50
00:03:32,001 --> 00:03:33,0
How long do you need?

51
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,8
Give me 8 hours.

52
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:38,8
If the Beast Factor Termination Vaccine spreads before then, it's over.

53
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,1
I'm going to stop Alan.

54
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:42,3
Don't let anyone in.

55
00:03:42,046 --> 00:03:43,1
Shirou!

56
00:03:45,053 --> 00:03:47,1
You have to stay.
No!

57
00:03:47,033 --> 00:03:50,5
There's no use for me in waiting. Get that through your thick skull!

58
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:04,7
Where are your parents?

59
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:12,5
It'll be okay. A cure is being made now, so everyone will heal and go back to normal.

60
00:04:12,063 --> 00:04:13,3
Really?

61
00:04:13,081 --> 00:04:21,2
Until then, listen to music or draw a bit. Do what makes you happy so your feelings don't go out of control.

62
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:22,1
Can you do that?

63
00:04:25,028 --> 00:04:27,9
Alright, let's go play with your friends.

64
00:04:28,045 --> 00:04:30,1
I'll take this child with me.

65
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,3
Please.

66
00:04:34,049 --> 00:04:35,6
Ms. Déesse Louve.

67
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,8
Boris...

68
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:41,6
Please forgive me. It was all under Alan's orders...

69
00:04:42,021 --> 00:04:45,7
We beastmen can't defy Sylvasta's orders.

70
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:48,4
However, we are free now.

71
00:04:48,066 --> 00:04:51,1
Let's run together!
There's no way I'd do that!

72
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,3
Stop meddling with my life...!

73
00:04:53,036 --> 00:04:56,0
You are mine, Déesse Louve!

74
00:04:56,019 --> 00:04:57,0
Let me go!

75
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,9
You're coming with me, Déesse Louve!

76
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:03,8
I'm not Déesse Louve! I am Nazuna!

77
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,5
You're seriously gross.

78
00:05:14,045 --> 00:05:18,6
Deésse Louve...
Why...?!

79
00:05:20,066 --> 00:05:22,6
Stop! I don't wanna date you!

80
00:05:30,002 --> 00:05:31,1
What's all this?!

81
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,1
They are drones equipped with the Beast Factor Termination Vaccine.

82
00:05:35,025 --> 00:05:36,1
Alan!

83
00:05:36,042 --> 00:05:40,5
I'll use these on all surplus rampaging beastmen in Animacity.

84
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:43,4
You're the one who made them rampage!

85
00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:45,0
What's your objective?!

86
00:05:45,049 --> 00:05:47,7
Everything is part of a necessary process.

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,0
I plan to let the world know about the dreadful Nirvasyl Syndrome...

88
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:54,2
...and legitimize the usage of the Beast Factor Termination Vaccine.

89
00:05:54,046 --> 00:05:56,3
This is a demonstration, so to speak.

90
00:05:56,054 --> 00:06:00,6
Is that why you threw Animacity into a crisis?! Unforgivable!

91
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:06,7
Calm down! As long as we use the Termination Vaccine to eliminate the Beast Factor, everything's gonna be fine.

92
00:06:06,095 --> 00:06:11,2
That's not a solution! You don't have to erase the Beast Factor. A serum is just enough!

93
00:06:11,027 --> 00:06:12,0
Serum?

94
00:06:12,026 --> 00:06:14,4
My blood and Nazuna's can be turned into a cure!

95
00:06:14,085 --> 00:06:18,3
If we complete the serum, there'll be no need to turn beastmen into humans!

96
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:21,5
That's... I wasn't able to predict that.

97
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:24,0
I started rampaging, but I went back to normal!

98
00:06:24,022 --> 00:06:26,3
So don't use the Termination Vaccine!

99
00:06:27,043 --> 00:06:30,1
I see. I get what you mean now.

100
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,5
Leave the rest to me.

101
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,3
Stop it!

102
00:06:41,046 --> 00:06:44,5
Ahh... There's no other way.

103
00:06:50,057 --> 00:06:51,5
Shirou!

104
00:06:55,001 --> 00:06:57,0
Make it stop...!

105
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:02,3
I thought you were smarter than this.

106
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,1
Isn't it amazing? Their precious Ginrou was actually a human...

107
00:07:06,015 --> 00:07:11,6
...and after finding out, those poor beastmen went insane and started rampaging, only to be turned into humans themselves...

108
00:07:12,049 --> 00:07:13,5
That's horrible...!

109
00:07:13,097 --> 00:07:17,6
Are you going to bite me? So scary~

110
00:07:45,022 --> 00:07:46,2
Damn it...

111
00:07:47,015 --> 00:07:50,3
Don't get in my way again, please.

112
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:55,7
I won't let a filthy human like you... destroy beastmen!

113
00:07:56,012 --> 00:07:58,8
Would you get those dirty paws off me?

114
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:01,8
What...?!

115
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,1
I'll teach you the truth about the world!

116
00:08:11,015 --> 00:08:11,9
A beastman...?!

117
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:15,0
His smell is completely human...!

118
00:08:15,068 --> 00:08:20,4
The Sylvasta Family has been living among humans and controlling them for generations.

119
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,7
Things like hiding your beastman side are easy.

120
00:08:24,024 --> 00:08:29,9
Unlike you hybrid beasts, we purebreds are the real beastmen.

121
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,6
Take a look at a true godly wolf.

122
00:08:40,045 --> 00:08:44,3
Originally, beastmen worshipped the local beasts as gods...

123
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,2
...and used their power for their own gain.

124
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:51,3
By refusing to mix with beasts of another nature, they kept their own blood pure.

125
00:08:51,085 --> 00:08:53,8
That's what a purebred is.

126
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:56,5
Most beastmen hated being in contact with humans...

127
00:08:56,076 --> 00:09:01,1
...so they let go of their original land and created a separate one with other beastmen.

128
00:09:01,065 --> 00:09:04,7
Just like you and other beastmen living in this city.

129
00:09:06,054 --> 00:09:12,8
Pride-born beastmen were the only ones who refused to mix with other blood and protected their pride.

130
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:17,3
This form is proof of those proud purebreds.

131
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:20,6
To think a hybrid like you calls himself a " protector"...

132
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,9
Your ignorance... is frightening!

133
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:28,1
You talk a lot for someone with three necks!

134
00:09:31,075 --> 00:09:33,1
You're immortal too?!

135
00:09:33,042 --> 00:09:35,7
Immortality is our exclusive right.

136
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,8
An undead ritual that can only be performed by the chosen...

137
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:43,0
...where you gather blood from a thousand wolf beastmen and pour it into your body.

138
00:09:43,017 --> 00:09:45,7
Doing that grants you this power.

139
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:48,7
It seems you've happened to meet the same fate.

140
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:53,2
But you're the result of mixed blood, so after all, you're no more than a sham.

141
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,8
A sham...?!

142
00:09:54,095 --> 00:09:57,2
Hybrids aren't even beastmen, anyways.

143
00:09:57,055 --> 00:10:01,6
Things like the Nirvasyl Syndrome happen only because you're a hybrid.

144
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,4
The mixture of Beast Factors leads to the stress that causes rampages.

145
00:10:06,056 --> 00:10:08,7
We purebreds don't have such an issue.

146
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:13,2
We will also keep ruling the world as purebreds, like always.

147
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,4
Controlling humans from the shadows, that is.

148
00:10:16,067 --> 00:10:18,9
That's the truth about the world!

149
00:10:33,012 --> 00:10:35,3
That's what you get for getting in my way.

150
00:10:45,084 --> 00:10:46,6
Stop!

151
00:11:14,011 --> 00:11:15,7
You're persistent!

152
00:11:18,082 --> 00:11:20,2
Déesse Louve...

153
00:11:23,085 --> 00:11:27,7
I'll turn a profit if I help you! So be grateful!

154
00:11:28,004 --> 00:11:28,9
You're...

155
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:32,1
A mangoose...!
A mink! Mari the Mink!

156
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:40,4
May you be a good beastman!

157
00:11:41,038 --> 00:11:44,4
Ginrou-sama! This way, come on!

158
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:45,8
My money!

159
00:11:46,022 --> 00:11:47,7
I'm not Ginrou!

160
00:11:48,014 --> 00:11:50,5
You gave us a Super Crust.

161
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:55,5
To us, anyone who feeds us when we're hungry is considered a god.

162
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,3
I ran in a dangerous direction!

163
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,3
This way!

164
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:02,5
We're surrounded!

165
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:05,9
If I knew running to save people would be like this...!

166
00:12:16,065 --> 00:12:18,5
Are you alright?
Pinga!

167
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:22,4
Stop that thing! It has a drug that turns beastmen into humans!

168
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,2
What?!

169
00:12:25,065 --> 00:12:26,6
Nazuna!

170
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,1
Pinga, take care of that drone!
Leave it to me!

171
00:12:44,032 --> 00:12:45,0
Michiru?

172
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:48,7
Michiru!
Nazuna!

173
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,6
Eh? W-what's going on?

174
00:12:57,038 --> 00:13:01,7
I don't know, but beastmen seem to react instinctively to this howling.

175
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:11,3
Those drones only seem to target rampaging beastmen.

176
00:13:11,072 --> 00:13:15,4
If only there was a way to make this howl reach all of Animacity...

177
00:13:18,028 --> 00:13:19,4
The live event!

178
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:23,6
Jackie, you and your friends should turn on as many TVs as you can in the city.

179
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:27,3
Me, Nazuna and Mari will go to the venue center and broadcast a video!

180
00:13:31,095 --> 00:13:33,9
These guys are annoying.

181
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:38,5
Where were you hiding all this?!
Illegal gun trafficking must have a limit, too!

182
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:44,1
Enemy invasion! Enemy invasion!
If you get hit by the enemy, you'll turn into a human!

183
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,6
So the bear goes after the honey?

184
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,5
I hope you appreciate me being a criminal!

185
00:13:57,009 --> 00:13:57,7
Go, go.

186
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:09,8
That's it!

187
00:14:10,056 --> 00:14:14,0
Mari, hurry up!
Be patient! This ain't easy.

188
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:20,6
Stop your useless struggling.

189
00:14:20,096 --> 00:14:21,6
Alan...!

190
00:14:22,015 --> 00:14:26,1
I don't know what you're scheming, but take a good look.

191
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,3
Animacity is over.

192
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:31,3
Beastmen will kill each other before that serum is completed...

193
00:14:31,051 --> 00:14:36,9
The city will be destroyed, and all those remaining will be turned into humans by the Termination Vaccine!

194
00:14:41,033 --> 00:14:45,0
A woman bearing those arms isn't very pretty.

195
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:50,7
You're a human, so wouldn't it be better for you to just go back to normal and live your life normally?

196
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:57,1
Being a girl, a beastman, a human...
I don't give a damn about any of that!

197
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:03,8
I'll decide what's normal for me... And how I live, and if I'm pretty or not as well!

198
00:15:04,035 --> 00:15:07,8
If there are beastmen who want to turn into humans, then so be it!

199
00:15:08,045 --> 00:15:11,6
But the way you stripped them from the right to decide that...

200
00:15:12,014 --> 00:15:14,3
It's really... Awfully...

201
00:15:14,085 --> 00:15:15,9
GROSS!

202
00:15:19,062 --> 00:15:21,5
That's a real shame!

203
00:15:21,077 --> 00:15:25,8
Good bye, you disgusting hybrid!

204
00:15:33,045 --> 00:15:34,5
Shirou!

205
00:15:36,045 --> 00:15:38,2
To think you were still alive...

206
00:15:39,014 --> 00:15:41,3
The people living inside me...

207
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:44,0
...they're telling me not to give up.

208
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,3
Those people you scoffed at for being hybrids!

209
00:15:57,095 --> 00:15:58,7
Alan...

210
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:00,7
He was a beastman all along...?

211
00:16:11,032 --> 00:16:13,6
Are you trying to buy some time?

212
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,3
That's right...!

213
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:19,0
Until I learn your tricks, that is!

214
00:16:22,035 --> 00:16:24,7
There's no way...

215
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,1
a filthy hybrid like you...

216
00:16:28,034 --> 00:16:30,4
...can match...

217
00:16:31,026 --> 00:16:32,5
...my divine howl!

218
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,1
What?!

219
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,5
Incredible...!

220
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:56,5
I haven't lived a thousand years for nothing!

221
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:59,6
That's... impossible...!

222
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,2
This isn't a "divine howl" or anything like that!

223
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:17,7
It just serves to kill people!

224
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:20,1
Do you want to taste it again?!

225
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:24,4
Let me go...! Stop it... Please stop... Sto...!

226
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,0
That's...!

227
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,9
...the Nirvasyl Syndrome!

228
00:17:32,097 --> 00:17:34,9
T... that can't be...!

229
00:17:35,032 --> 00:17:36,9
You're in shambles.

230
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:39,9
What was that about "not being affected"?

231
00:17:40,037 --> 00:17:44,1
I'll finish you before your reason fades away!

232
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:47,0
Someone help me! Please!

233
00:18:05,055 --> 00:18:09,5
Her antibodies run through my blood.

234
00:18:20,043 --> 00:18:22,5
Why... did you save me...?

235
00:18:23,049 --> 00:18:25,3
I don't want to live with regrets anymore.

236
00:18:32,076 --> 00:18:34,9
Michiru! All ready.

237
00:18:34,096 --> 00:18:36,1
Give me that video.

238
00:18:38,055 --> 00:18:40,5
No way! I have no battery?!

239
00:18:41,005 --> 00:18:43,5
Seriously?! We have to charge it up!

240
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,8
Shirou!

241
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:48,7
Please! Can you howl?

242
00:18:49,036 --> 00:18:52,8
The only one who can protect Animacity... is Ginrou!

243
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:02,0
The real one is amazing!

244
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,6
This is when I realized.

245
00:19:23,056 --> 00:19:25,7
Me and Nazuna are different from them.

246
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:30,7
...but seeing Shirou so sad, so miserable...

247
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:34,5
...but still thinking about others...

248
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:48,5
It took some time, but the rampaging beastmen went back to normal.

249
00:19:49,028 --> 00:19:54,3
Get your limited 5 photo set of the new Animacity symbol, Nazuna!

250
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:58,9
A video recorded from a hidden camera that caught Nazuna saving a kid buzzed around...

251
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:02,3
...and she became popular among beastmen and humans.

252
00:20:02,065 --> 00:20:05,4
She says she didn't know there was a camera...

253
00:20:05,065 --> 00:20:07,4
...but I think she definitely knew.

254
00:20:08,025 --> 00:20:11,3
She's very calculating.

255
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:15,9
We protected our autonomy.

256
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:20,3
After negotiating with the Prime Minister and the Sylvasta Conglomerate...

257
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,4
...they reluctantly accepted.

258
00:20:23,016 --> 00:20:29,6
Alan resigned as the President of Sylvasta Pharmaceutics, so it's safe to assume he's going to lay low for now.

259
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,4
I will change this city.

260
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:36,1
To make them understand what we are.

261
00:20:36,055 --> 00:20:38,7
I will invite humans to the city as well.

262
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:42,2
And I'll have beastmen learn about humans, too.

263
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:44,0
Can you do such a thing?

264
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,3
It will be difficult.

265
00:20:46,099 --> 00:20:48,9
But I'll take it slow.

266
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:51,4
Thankfully, I have time.

267
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,3
We both do.

268
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,0
Shirou!

269
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:02,9
Is your body okay now?

270
00:21:03,045 --> 00:21:04,2
Yeah!

271
00:21:11,005 --> 00:21:11,9
See?

272
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,9
Sorry for everything.

273
00:21:15,016 --> 00:21:17,0
It's not your fault.

274
00:21:17,046 --> 00:21:19,6
The cure for your beastman disease is near, too.

275
00:21:20,055 --> 00:21:21,2
That's good.

276
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,0
You'll be able to go home.

277
00:21:24,092 --> 00:21:26,5
I'm fine like this.

278
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,9
I'll stay here for now.

279
00:21:30,095 --> 00:21:34,6
Only Nazuna and I have experience being both beastman and human.

280
00:21:35,025 --> 00:21:38,7
I think there are things here that I can only accomplish the way I am right now.

281
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:43,8
Besides, I like the current me.

282
00:21:47,035 --> 00:21:48,8
What will you do in this city?

283
00:21:49,055 --> 00:21:51,4
I can't say for sure yet, but...

284
00:21:51,085 --> 00:21:53,9
...I'll look for things only I can do.

285
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:56,7
Like playing basketball, and helping Nazuna out.

286
00:21:57,009 --> 00:21:59,4
Of course, I'll help you out, too.

287
00:22:00,036 --> 00:22:02,0
I don't remember asking you, though.

288
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:09,9
Say, the night I first got here, I saw Ginrou.

289
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:14,7
You were really happy about that festival, weren't you?

290
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:18,0
That's why you wanted to celebrate as Ginrou.

291
00:22:18,058 --> 00:22:22,9
But wouldn't it be better to be in whatever form you want to be on from now on?

292
00:22:23,048 --> 00:22:24,5
Michiru!

293
00:22:25,022 --> 00:22:26,5
Let's go get some tea!

294
00:22:27,015 --> 00:22:28,1
Okay!

295
00:22:28,076 --> 00:22:29,9
I'll get going, then.

296
00:22:37,012 --> 00:22:38,4
We might be able to change...

297
00:22:42,075 --> 00:22:43,6
...this city, too.
