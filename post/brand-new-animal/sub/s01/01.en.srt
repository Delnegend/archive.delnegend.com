BEASTMEN SHOULD DIE

4
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:16,6
10 years have passed since the enforcement of the Beastmen Special Zone.
There's strong antipathy against...

5
00:02:16,081 --> 00:02:20,6
...Beastmen Territory, and a protest at the front of the Congress is currently ongoing.

6
00:02:23,027 --> 00:02:25,1
Now departing. All standing passengers...

7
00:02:25,023 --> 00:02:28,0
...please hold onto the handrails.

8
00:03:15,007 --> 00:03:17,6
Ever since we established the Beastmen Territory Law...

9
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:22,7
...we have managed to develop Animacity, a city where beastmen can...

10
00:03:22,087 --> 00:03:24,8
...truly live as themselves.

11
00:03:27,025 --> 00:03:28,5
That's it!

12
00:03:29,059 --> 00:03:33,5
We are currently cooperating on the Beastmen
Special Zone Development Project.

Beast New Age
SYLVASTA Pharmaceutics

14
00:03:54,032 --> 00:03:55,1
Damn it...

15
00:04:17,001 --> 00:04:18,4
Ouch...

16
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:38,0
Damn beastman...

17
00:04:38,061 --> 00:04:41,4
We can easily see through you!

18
00:04:41,095 --> 00:04:44,7
This is the path that everyone who escapes Animacity takes.

19
00:04:44,087 --> 00:04:47,4
You'll bite the dust if you stick around here!

20
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:50,5
Monsters like you are multiplying...

21
00:04:50,067 --> 00:04:52,4
It's a goddamn eyesore!

22
00:04:52,088 --> 00:04:54,8
Drop dead!

23
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:57,6
Excuse me!

24
00:04:59,034 --> 00:05:02,8
Could you stop that~?

25
00:05:03,026 --> 00:05:06,1
That kid is one of my precious customers.

26
00:05:06,027 --> 00:05:09,0
Please be gentle.

27
00:05:13,007 --> 00:05:16,1
Suddenly shooting an arrow at me...

28
00:05:17,011 --> 00:05:20,6
Isn't that... a bit rude?

29
00:05:24,087 --> 00:05:28,6
Let's dispose of these guys already.

30
00:05:31,017 --> 00:05:35,1
It'd be a pain in the ass if you kill them, so try to hold back a bit.

31
00:05:49,081 --> 00:05:53,6
The path to Animacity is ridded with beast hunters.

32
00:05:54,015 --> 00:05:57,6
But you don't have to worry. I will be taking you there.

33
00:05:57,078 --> 00:05:59,5
W-who are you?

34
00:06:00,015 --> 00:06:03,9
I'm the one who extends her hand to beastmen in trouble...

35
00:06:04,008 --> 00:06:07,4
...a loving volunteer, Mari Itami!

36
00:06:09,025 --> 00:06:10,6
That's kind of shady.

37
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:12,8
That hurts.

38
00:06:12,096 --> 00:06:15,2
So how much is it?

39
00:06:15,034 --> 00:06:17,5
I said I was a volunteer, though...

40
00:06:17,071 --> 00:06:20,2
You're the type to charge me afterwards, right?

41
00:06:20,063 --> 00:06:22,4
You're not too charming, are you?

42
00:06:22,059 --> 00:06:25,1
If I had any charm, I wouldn't be here right now.

43
00:06:25,022 --> 00:06:26,5
You're certainly right.

44
00:06:26,064 --> 00:06:29,2
Guess I'll take all the money you have then.

45
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,6
Are you serious?!

46
00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:36,6
It's the price for your life, so don't be stingy about it!

47
00:06:36,082 --> 00:06:38,4
Am I right?

48
00:06:39,003 --> 00:06:41,7
Don't say it so happily.

49
00:06:59,059 --> 00:07:02,9
Is that city really only for beastmen?

50
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:05,0
Yep! Animacity.

51
00:07:05,018 --> 00:07:06,6
Are you also an outlier?

52
00:07:19,082 --> 00:07:21,6
Don't worry.

53
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,0
You'll be able to sleep properly from now on.

54
00:07:26,032 --> 00:07:27,3
Yeah...

55
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,4
Alright, we're here.

56
00:07:32,054 --> 00:07:36,3
Once you get off the boat, we're back to complete strangers.

57
00:07:37,021 --> 00:07:39,6
Got it. Thank you!

58
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:10,6
What's this? It's way too quiet...

59
00:09:13,056 --> 00:09:15,3
It's a festival!

60
00:09:17,064 --> 00:09:19,2
It's the mayor!

61
00:09:19,081 --> 00:09:20,9
Mayor Rose!
It's the mayor!

62
00:09:21,011 --> 00:09:22,1
Mayor, let's go!

63
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,3
It's been ten years since Animacity was built.

64
00:09:25,048 --> 00:09:29,1
The gap between beastmen and humans hasn't been closed yet.

65
00:09:29,078 --> 00:09:34,3
Regardless, this city continues to be the safe haven for beastmen.

66
00:09:34,087 --> 00:09:37,8
These past ten years, and the following ten years...

67
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,8
No, for the sake of the future that lies beyond...

68
00:09:41,033 --> 00:09:43,4
Let's celebrate the anniversary!

69
00:09:49,026 --> 00:09:51,7
Everyone is really a beastman!

70
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:55,6
There's no need to run anymore!

71
00:10:22,008 --> 00:10:24,5
Ah, I'm sorry... Huh?

72
00:10:28,067 --> 00:10:29,5
Whoa...

73
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:32,3
What a nice smell...

74
00:10:32,043 --> 00:10:36,1
It's the smell of beasts filled with joy and happiness.

75
00:10:36,064 --> 00:10:37,4
What?

76
00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:42,2
Celebrate. It's the festival that beastmen have waited for for a thousand years.

77
00:10:42,035 --> 00:10:43,9
O-okay...

78
00:10:44,098 --> 00:10:46,9
There are many types of people, huh...

79
00:10:47,002 --> 00:10:49,5
He's crying... and he's scary.

80
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,9
What's up with that guy?

81
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:08,4
Mayor, it's from the Prime Minister, Shiramizu.

82
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:13,0
Congratulations on the ten-year anniversary, Mayor Rose.

83
00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:16,0
It is all thanks to your comprehension.

84
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:19,9
Ahaha, don't get me wrong, though.

85
00:11:20,006 --> 00:11:22,6
The Beastmen Special Zone isn't impenetrable.

86
00:11:22,077 --> 00:11:25,7
If you beastmen start behaving dangerously...

87
00:11:25,086 --> 00:11:29,6
I don't know what could happen, or when...

88
00:11:33,003 --> 00:11:35,4
I'm sincerely counting on you.

89
00:11:38,053 --> 00:11:42,9
Same as always, huh. I can't tell if he's celebrating or threatening us.

90
00:11:43,008 --> 00:11:45,6
Even so, ten years have passed.

91
00:11:48,084 --> 00:11:51,7
To Rose Barbarei's ten-year fight.

92
00:11:51,084 --> 00:11:54,8
To ten more years of Animacity.

93
00:12:09,077 --> 00:12:11,9
This is pretty strong!

94
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:15,6
Oh my, being a glutton? I knew you had more.

95
00:12:16,049 --> 00:12:17,5
You're that weasel!

96
00:12:17,066 --> 00:12:19,6
Not a weasel! A mink!

97
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:20,8
Really?

98
00:12:20,099 --> 00:12:24,2
Don't confuse me with those cheap-fur animals!

99
00:12:24,033 --> 00:12:25,5
Okay...

100
00:12:25,092 --> 00:12:28,3
I said "all your money", didn't I?

101
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:31,2
Kids are so treacherous lately...

102
00:12:31,038 --> 00:12:33,1
I won't give you any more money.

103
00:12:33,067 --> 00:12:35,7
We're back to complete strangers, right?

104
00:12:35,084 --> 00:12:39,1
Do I really look that selfish to you?

105
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:42,1
That makes me sad... So sad...

106
00:12:44,081 --> 00:12:46,0
Ah! A thief!

107
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:48,1
Oh, poor thing.

108
00:12:48,031 --> 00:12:52,7
Be careful~ Animacity is full of sneaky people like that.

109
00:12:52,086 --> 00:12:54,3
Did you really...?!

110
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:57,1
You sure you wanna argue? The pickpocket is getting away.

111
00:12:58,045 --> 00:13:00,3
Damn it!

112
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:04,1
Someone! Catch that pickpocket!

113
00:13:12,055 --> 00:13:13,8
Hold it!

114
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,3
Where'd he go?

115
00:13:34,036 --> 00:13:36,5
God damn it!

116
00:14:03,097 --> 00:14:05,3
Move it!

117
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:08,8
Hurry up, grandpa!

118
00:14:11,056 --> 00:14:13,2
Crapcrapcrapcrapcrap...!

119
00:14:25,008 --> 00:14:26,9
Ouch...

120
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:31,1
You're the crying guy!

121
00:14:33,033 --> 00:14:35,2
Wait, you're crying again.

122
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,4
It was you?! The one wrecked the beastmen festival?!

123
00:14:41,055 --> 00:14:45,1
It wasn't me! I just punched a pillar!

124
00:14:45,043 --> 00:14:46,8
And you made it explode?!

125
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,4
Are you for real?

126
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,9
I'm telling you it wasn't me!

127
00:14:53,048 --> 00:14:54,9
That guy...

128
00:14:55,044 --> 00:14:57,6
He was sneaking around those pillars!

129
00:14:57,078 --> 00:14:58,8
That guy?

130
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:39,2
It seems this was a misunderstanding. I'm sorry.

131
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,3
Huh?

132
00:15:43,061 --> 00:15:45,9
The hell is up with that guy?

133
00:15:49,008 --> 00:15:51,2
Right! The pickpocket!

134
00:16:12,022 --> 00:16:13,6
What?

135
00:16:14,081 --> 00:16:18,4
A bummer, isn't it? It was a smell-less bomb!

136
00:16:18,086 --> 00:16:21,4
You can't tell even if you're a beastman!

137
00:16:24,011 --> 00:16:26,2
Whoa!! The hell is this?!

138
00:16:36,033 --> 00:16:37,7
That hurt...

139
00:16:38,017 --> 00:16:39,9
Is this guy immortal or something?!

140
00:16:40,054 --> 00:16:43,9
Spit it out. Why did you interrupt the festival?

141
00:16:45,076 --> 00:16:48,3
Ouch...!

142
00:17:00,065 --> 00:17:03,6
Huh, that was quick.

143
00:17:03,078 --> 00:17:06,7
What's wrong, Satou? Did your trap fail?

144
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,2
Be careful...

145
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,7
That damn wolf... He completely outdid my bomb!

146
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,4
It seems they're pros.

147
00:17:30,014 --> 00:17:31,7
I see...

148
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:33,8
Humans!

149
00:17:37,085 --> 00:17:40,3
You bastards were bought out by humans, huh?

150
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:43,3
How could you tell, huh?

151
00:17:45,032 --> 00:17:48,9
You cannot cover up such a deep human smell.

152
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:52,3
What an effective nose you have!

153
00:17:53,024 --> 00:17:56,2
You were bought out by anti-beastmen humans...

154
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,4
You're pretty stuck on that "bought out" thing.

155
00:18:01,004 --> 00:18:03,9
It doesn't matter if it's a human or a beastman.

156
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:06,8
When it comes to contracted work...

157
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,8
...we'll do it properly!

158
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:11,4
That's all there is to it!

159
00:18:11,097 --> 00:18:16,2
Is that... why you ruined... the festival...?

160
00:18:17,022 --> 00:18:19,2
You gotta be kidding me!

161
00:18:20,077 --> 00:18:22,8
You damn...
W-whoa!

162
00:18:22,098 --> 00:18:24,4
That sin...

163
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,4
You'll atone for it with your life.

164
00:18:36,037 --> 00:18:40,5
You damn beastmen who sold their souls to humans...

165
00:18:41,004 --> 00:18:45,3
You bastards aren't even worth using my claws on.

166
00:18:46,067 --> 00:18:48,3
My fists are more than enough!

167
00:18:49,001 --> 00:18:50,8
Bring it on!

168
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:53,9
You better not regret it!

169
00:19:18,054 --> 00:19:19,3
Let go!

170
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:22,7
You, who lost the pride of a beastman...

171
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:25,2
...you don't need the pride of a deer!

172
00:19:25,033 --> 00:19:26,5
Stop it... I beg you...!

173
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,3
My antlers... Anything but my...!

174
00:19:33,022 --> 00:19:35,6
Stop right there, you greenhorn.

175
00:19:37,005 --> 00:19:39,3
Branding me as a greenhorn...

176
00:19:57,012 --> 00:19:57,9
Don't move!

177
00:19:59,058 --> 00:20:02,4
If you move, this kid's life is done!

178
00:20:03,016 --> 00:20:06,3
Whose life is done, you said?

179
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,3
Hold on!

180
00:20:13,042 --> 00:20:15,3
That's horrible!

181
00:20:24,043 --> 00:20:26,9
That's enough, isn't it? Those poor people!

182
00:20:27,081 --> 00:20:31,1
Don't try to stop me. These guys ruined the festival.

183
00:20:31,032 --> 00:20:35,1
They're beastmen too, though! This is...

184
00:20:35,061 --> 00:20:38,1
These guys were hired by humans.

185
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:40,5
They're a disgrace to all beastmen.

186
00:20:41,012 --> 00:20:42,9
That much is right.

187
00:20:44,062 --> 00:20:46,0
Stop it!

188
00:20:47,067 --> 00:20:51,1
I said stop it!

189
00:21:04,073 --> 00:21:06,2
That's enough!

190
00:21:06,081 --> 00:21:09,3
Why are you fighting against your own people?

191
00:21:09,048 --> 00:21:12,8
Wasn't this city a "beastmen paradise"?

192
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:17,8
That's exactly why.

193
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:20,2
Humans are enemies to this city.

194
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:22,9
Beastmen hired by humans are the same.

195
00:21:23,058 --> 00:21:25,4
Not all humans are like that!

196
00:21:26,071 --> 00:21:28,9
All humans are the same.

197
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,7
That's not true!

198
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:32,7
Because...

199
00:21:34,013 --> 00:21:35,6
...I'm also a human!

200
00:21:38,001 --> 00:21:39,3
That's right...

201
00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:41,7
I am a human...

202
00:21:44,056 --> 00:21:46,4
...I was a human!

203
00:21:49,014 --> 00:21:50,9
With that appearance?

204
00:21:51,052 --> 00:21:56,5

205
00:22:45,053 --> 00:22:50,5
