Michiru!

00:01:19,066 --> 00:01:21,8
Jackie! Why are you here?

5
00:01:21,099 --> 00:01:24,2
This bread crust is delicious!

6
00:01:24,037 --> 00:01:27,7
It doesn't just have the brown bits, it has white bits too!

7
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:30,0
Have you only eaten crusts?

8
00:01:30,017 --> 00:01:32,9
It's great! This bread crust is delicious!

9
00:01:33,005 --> 00:01:35,1
It's a Special Super Crust!
Y-yay, great...

10
00:01:35,026 --> 00:01:37,5
Even the smell is different!

11
00:01:41,014 --> 00:01:42,6
A friend of yours?

12
00:01:42,076 --> 00:01:46,0
Yeah.
Ah, sorry for all the fuss.

13
00:01:47,044 --> 00:01:49,8
It's really easy for you to make friends, huh.

14
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,9
Ginrou-sama!

15
00:01:52,036 --> 00:01:54,1
Ginrou-sama!
Ginrou-sama!

16
00:01:54,053 --> 00:01:57,4
Thank you for the Super Crust!

17
00:01:57,061 --> 00:02:01,1
If you're hungry, you're free to come by at any time.

18
00:02:01,028 --> 00:02:02,8
Ginrou-sama~!

19
00:02:03,066 --> 00:02:05,3
May you become a good beastman.

20
00:02:05,033 --> 00:02:08,0
May you become a good beastman!

21
00:02:13,015 --> 00:02:17,3
Still... Is it okay to have so many beastmen gathered in the live event?

22
00:02:17,088 --> 00:02:21,7
"Being positive and feeling festive is very important"...

23
00:02:21,089 --> 00:02:22,8
...is what Alan said.

24
00:02:23,022 --> 00:02:26,9
Now that you mention it, there was a festival going on when I first arrived.

25
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,7
It'll be broadcast live too...

26
00:02:28,085 --> 00:02:31,6
...so I chose some fun songs for now.

27
00:02:31,081 --> 00:02:33,4
What do you think?

28
00:02:35,073 --> 00:02:38,5
Huh? Are you gonna sing this?
Is that no good?

29
00:02:38,065 --> 00:02:41,9
Nazuna... You always make a dumb face when you sing this song.

30
00:02:42,007 --> 00:02:42,9
What?

31
00:02:43,003 --> 00:02:45,5
I mean, come on. That song isn't even in here!

32
00:02:45,091 --> 00:02:49,7
Hm, that's true, but I figured it wouldn't be fitting for a live event...

33
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:51,0
That's not true!

34
00:02:51,021 --> 00:02:54,3
Really?
Yeah! I wanna hear it too!

35
00:02:58,001 --> 00:02:59,8
So show me

36
00:03:00,022 --> 00:03:04,0
that shimmer that sparkles in the night

37
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:08,1
and fly around as much as you want

38
00:03:08,031 --> 00:03:12,3
Let's run around more freely

39
00:03:12,048 --> 00:03:16,0
to look up at the stars

40
00:03:20,011 --> 00:03:21,5
It's decided
Damn.

41
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,8
I'm not just gonna choose whatever you like.

42
00:03:24,095 --> 00:03:26,4
Huh? Hey.

43
00:03:26,095 --> 00:03:29,9
What's this about "a revelation from the MC"?

44
00:03:30,025 --> 00:03:34,6
Ah, that? That's when I'll say "Actually, I'm a human"!

45
00:03:36,013 --> 00:03:38,9
Are you sure it's okay to blurt that out?

46
00:03:39,005 --> 00:03:41,2
When Alan finishes the cure...

47
00:03:41,038 --> 00:03:45,3
...he said it would be needed to alleviate the stress of beastmen.

48
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:48,8
I... see.

49
00:03:49,072 --> 00:03:54,2
Humans and beastmen aren't all that different. They go about their lives very similarly.

50
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,6
We're the ones who can say that, right?

51
00:03:57,077 --> 00:04:00,1
Y... Yeah...

52
00:04:15,067 --> 00:04:16,6
Through the roof...?!

53
00:04:26,005 --> 00:04:27,0
Don't move!

54
00:04:30,064 --> 00:04:31,8
Leave this to me.

55
00:04:31,098 --> 00:04:33,1
Hurry back to Animacity.

56
00:04:34,002 --> 00:04:36,5
Ishizaki, thank you!

57
00:04:41,078 --> 00:04:43,1
Are the boats ready?

58
00:04:43,057 --> 00:04:46,4
We have 1000 freighters ready.

59
00:04:46,057 --> 00:04:49,4
We should have 5000 large cruisers in the next 5 days.

60
00:04:49,053 --> 00:04:52,5
That should balance out the amount of people from the cult.

61
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,4
Thank you.

62
00:04:54,058 --> 00:04:58,2
If this city disappears, it'll be a pain for me, too.

63
00:04:58,042 --> 00:05:02,0
Huh, to think you'd join forces.

64
00:05:02,059 --> 00:05:05,8
The Silver Wolf Order is looking for you.

65
00:05:06,038 --> 00:05:08,0
Who started the search?

66
00:05:08,047 --> 00:05:12,1
I start moving before I get asked to do it, so the profits are bigger.

67
00:05:12,031 --> 00:05:14,9
It seems the tanuki girl is involved, too.

68
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,7
It's fine if you don't wanna know, though.

69
00:05:19,011 --> 00:05:20,7
Just start talking.

70
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:24,5
She was talking with that guru about the live event.

71
00:05:24,065 --> 00:05:27,7
Apparently she plans to blurt out that she's a human.

72
00:05:28,024 --> 00:05:32,6
Saying that "it will ease the minds of beastmen after the cure is made" or something.

73
00:05:33,012 --> 00:05:34,1
What?!

74
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:42,8
Hey, Nazuna. Are you really doing that confession?

75
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,9
I told you.

76
00:05:45,005 --> 00:05:48,3
It's needed to prevent the Nirvasyl Syndrome from taking over.

77
00:05:49,064 --> 00:05:50,7
Okay...

78
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:53,8
But if Shirou hears that, I bet he'll be mad.

79
00:05:54,035 --> 00:05:57,5
Why? I'm doing this for the sake of beastmen...

80
00:05:57,064 --> 00:05:58,9
There's no way he'll be mad.

81
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,0
I wonder...

82
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:02,5
Ms. Déesse Louve.

83
00:06:02,098 --> 00:06:04,9
We should be leaving soon.

84
00:06:05,003 --> 00:06:07,1
Michiru can come too, right?

85
00:06:07,078 --> 00:06:09,4
People will be watching.

86
00:06:09,061 --> 00:06:11,9
C'mon... It's fine just for today, isn't it?

87
00:06:12,012 --> 00:06:15,0
It's fine. I have something I wanna do either way.

88
00:06:15,066 --> 00:06:16,5
Really?

89
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:20,2
I'll let the receptionist know you're coming...

90
00:06:20,037 --> 00:06:22,6
...so don't be late, okay?
Okay!

91
00:06:22,075 --> 00:06:24,4
See you later then!

92
00:06:57,054 --> 00:07:00,5
This festival is more crowded than that time...

93
00:07:00,071 --> 00:07:02,1
When did it...

94
00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:03,5
Michiru~!

95
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,0
Did I scare you?

96
00:07:08,021 --> 00:07:09,0
Mr. Gem?

97
00:07:09,017 --> 00:07:11,2
It's Ginrou-sama's live event!

98
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:13,3
It's a festival!

99
00:07:13,051 --> 00:07:15,0
Mr. Gem! Ms. Melissa!

100
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,1
You two made this?!

101
00:07:17,064 --> 00:07:20,9
This is to show our appreciation towards Ginrou-sama.

102
00:07:21,006 --> 00:07:24,8
Before this city was built, there were some things...

103
00:07:24,094 --> 00:07:30,1
...that hurt deep within our hearts that we'd rather not remember.

104
00:07:30,095 --> 00:07:32,5
Of course, that applies to us, too.

105
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:37,4
So we wanted to show just how much Ginrou-sama's legend...

106
00:07:37,054 --> 00:07:39,9
...helped us stay afloat back then.

107
00:07:40,008 --> 00:07:42,7
That's why everyone made this!

108
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,7
Everyone...?

109
00:07:44,021 --> 00:07:47,6
Yeah! Every beastman in Animacity participated!

110
00:07:48,013 --> 00:07:52,0
It carries the gratefulness of being protected for a thousand years.

111
00:07:52,022 --> 00:07:56,1
It might not reach Ginrou-sama, though.

112
00:07:59,035 --> 00:08:02,8
I'm sure everyone's feelings will make it through!

113
00:08:02,094 --> 00:08:06,1
I'm sure Ginrou-sama would cry tears of joy.

114
00:08:07,048 --> 00:08:09,6
That would be nice!

115
00:08:10,003 --> 00:08:10,9
I'm sure it will!

116
00:08:11,053 --> 00:08:13,1
Thank you, Michiru.

117
00:08:20,075 --> 00:08:22,3
Michiru?

118
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,8
Where's Michiru?

119
00:08:24,017 --> 00:08:26,8
Who knows? She hasn't come here yet.

120
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,8
Damn it. She still doesn't care about being on time.

121
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:33,7
Where is he?

122
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,7
Shirou...

123
00:08:47,077 --> 00:08:51,2
In any case, Kuromaki will get The Family's things onto the boat.

124
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,4
Only the slum people are left.

125
00:08:53,057 --> 00:08:55,7
It'll be easy as long as we offer money.

126
00:08:56,007 --> 00:08:58,6
Mari, you're good with words.

127
00:08:58,078 --> 00:09:00,8
Get as many people out of that venue as you can.

128
00:09:01,049 --> 00:09:02,5
Leave it to me.

129
00:09:04,071 --> 00:09:08,6
Do you need that?
Failure is not an option.

130
00:09:08,075 --> 00:09:10,6
If that's the case, we'll go too.

131
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,5
We can't be flashy or provoke the audience.

132
00:09:13,071 --> 00:09:15,9
I'll call you in case things go awry.

133
00:09:16,063 --> 00:09:18,4
I'll deal with the guru myself.

134
00:09:54,013 --> 00:09:55,3
Shirou!

135
00:09:56,005 --> 00:09:57,9
It's almost time.

136
00:09:58,005 --> 00:10:02,7
The lost beastmen patiently wait for your appearance.

137
00:10:04,068 --> 00:10:08,0
You can do it, Nazuna. You'll be the real deal.

138
00:10:13,069 --> 00:10:18,0
This road is swarming with police and beastmen suppresion forces.

139
00:10:18,082 --> 00:10:21,9
Aside from that, the entrance to Animacity is full of inspectors.

140
00:10:22,028 --> 00:10:25,2
I don't think walking there is an option, Mayor.

141
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,2
Are you perhaps Pinga?

142
00:10:28,033 --> 00:10:31,4
As expected of the Mayor. You know your stuff.

143
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:37,1
Why are you here?

144
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:42,3
I found out things are getting pretty bad by intercepting government calls.

145
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:46,5
When I came back to investigate, I saw you being chased by humans.

146
00:10:46,065 --> 00:10:50,2
It'd be a pain if you got killed before making the graves for my comrades.

147
00:10:50,073 --> 00:10:53,4
And I don't want the efforts of the tanuki girl to go to waste.

148
00:10:57,036 --> 00:10:59,8
Those are anti-beastmen mobile weapons.

149
00:10:59,095 --> 00:11:00,7
Weapons?

150
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:05,1
Yeah. I saw those being used in anti-beastmen riots.

151
00:11:05,028 --> 00:11:07,9
That's...! We must hurry to Animacity!

152
00:11:08,054 --> 00:11:10,3
That's the plan!

153
00:11:15,021 --> 00:11:17,3
What should I do...?

154
00:11:31,064 --> 00:11:32,6
Why...

155
00:11:33,023 --> 00:11:34,3
Shirou.

156
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:37,1
Don't get in my way.

157
00:12:20,094 --> 00:12:24,3
The soul who walked towards

158
00:12:24,049 --> 00:12:27,2
the place where light shines

159
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:30,8
together with much compassion

160
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,6
we'll see an endless dream

161
00:12:40,042 --> 00:12:44,0
I'm sorry! The feelings you have regarding beastmen...

162
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,0
...I should've been able to understand.

163
00:12:47,026 --> 00:12:49,5
I turned from a human to a beastman.

164
00:12:49,064 --> 00:12:52,9
I knew the most about the fear of turning into someone else.

165
00:12:53,052 --> 00:12:56,9
But I didn't pay attention to how you felt.

166
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,3
So I needed to apologize.

167
00:13:00,061 --> 00:13:01,4
You...

168
00:13:02,003 --> 00:13:03,9
But it's becoming confusing again.

169
00:13:04,061 --> 00:13:08,9
What are you trying to do? Why do you have a gun...?

170
00:13:09,003 --> 00:13:11,3
I won't get it unless you tell me!

171
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:14,7
Nazuna is my friend!

172
00:13:15,012 --> 00:13:18,4
Why are you trying to...

173
00:13:19,004 --> 00:13:20,4
Why...

174
00:13:27,068 --> 00:13:28,6
I'm sorry.

175
00:13:30,051 --> 00:13:32,6
I don't want to hurt your friend.

176
00:13:32,081 --> 00:13:34,7
But this live event...

177
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:39,1
No... I've got to stop that confession from happening.

178
00:13:39,081 --> 00:13:42,4
If the guru confesses she's a human...

179
00:13:42,057 --> 00:13:45,4
It will trigger the Nirvasyl Syndrome.

180
00:13:47,082 --> 00:13:50,2
When will she talk about her identity?

181
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:52,8
Is the confession really a trigger?

182
00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:56,5
I'm sure of it. Beastmen are stubborn.

183
00:13:56,066 --> 00:14:00,2
Their emotions are deeper, and their prejudices are strong.

184
00:14:00,042 --> 00:14:03,0
If they find out they were tricked by those they believe in...

185
00:14:03,017 --> 00:14:05,3
The shock that would cause is incomparable.

186
00:14:05,097 --> 00:14:07,4
They will rampage.

187
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:10,6
So the exact opposite of what Alan told Nazuna?

188
00:14:11,022 --> 00:14:12,8
Alan told her knowing this.

189
00:14:13,035 --> 00:14:15,1
What? For what?

190
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,8
I don't know.

191
00:14:16,098 --> 00:14:20,0
Either way, stopping the confession comes first.

192
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:22,6
Are you able to persuade her?

193
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:27,5
We're suddenly upside down

194
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:30,3
and the world changes around us

195
00:14:30,045 --> 00:14:32,5
She flies above the audience during this song...

196
00:14:32,091 --> 00:14:37,0
...then she moves to the opposite side of the stage and changes costumes. That's when...

197
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,9
The opposite side...

198
00:14:39,042 --> 00:14:41,3
I'll fly. It'll be faster that way.

199
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:44,4
Don't provoke the audience. I'll go there later.

200
00:14:44,055 --> 00:14:45,7
Got it.

201
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:53,3
I feel like crying, but I don't want to lose

202
00:14:53,043 --> 00:14:55,2
So show me

203
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:58,8
that shimmer that sparkles in the night

204
00:14:58,098 --> 00:15:00,9
and fly around...

205
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:08,0
Inspector...

206
00:15:08,053 --> 00:15:12,0
President Alan said you would definitely come this way.

207
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:13,2
Alan?

208
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:16,1
It's a shame it's come to this.

209
00:15:16,024 --> 00:15:19,0
Inspector, there's no time. Let me through.

210
00:15:19,016 --> 00:15:22,5
I can't do that. You're wanted by the police.

211
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:25,0
I'll make up for that sin later!

212
00:15:25,021 --> 00:15:26,5
The city is in danger!

213
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,2
If we don't stop this, the city will be destroyed!

214
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:31,2
What are you saying?

215
00:15:31,068 --> 00:15:35,1
I want to protect all beastmen. That's really all I want!

216
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:39,2
I beg you! Don't make this city a living hell!

217
00:15:45,015 --> 00:15:46,4
Phew, I made it.

218
00:15:50,095 --> 00:15:54,8
There's a change in the plans. Do your confession here.

219
00:15:56,024 --> 00:15:59,2
The audience is past the expected point of excitement.

220
00:15:59,066 --> 00:16:03,0
Let's make every effort to move forward.

221
00:16:03,042 --> 00:16:04,2
Got it.

222
00:16:05,029 --> 00:16:09,1
Everyone! Are you excited?

223
00:16:09,071 --> 00:16:11,1
What? This isn't in the schedule!

224
00:16:12,093 --> 00:16:15,9
I'm very excited, too!
This is bad...!

225
00:16:19,006 --> 00:16:24,2
Having so many people gathered here today...

226
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,6
Thank you so much, everyone!

227
00:16:29,078 --> 00:16:31,8
May you become a good beastman!

228
00:16:31,094 --> 00:16:34,0
May you become a good beastman!

229
00:16:34,053 --> 00:16:36,6
May you become a good beastman!

230
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:39,5
May you become a good beastman!

231
00:16:51,017 --> 00:16:52,8
Actually...

232
00:16:52,097 --> 00:16:56,3
There's something I really want to tell everyone today.

233
00:16:56,043 --> 00:16:59,0
What~?
What is it?

234
00:16:59,068 --> 00:17:01,1
That's...

235
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,1
Nazuna!
Michiru?!

236
00:17:19,058 --> 00:17:21,5
Don't do the confession!
Huh?

237
00:17:25,062 --> 00:17:27,7
Please. Trust me!

238
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:33,4
Something I really want to tell everyone.

239
00:17:34,009 --> 00:17:35,6
That is...

240
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:41,6
...how grateful I am for everyone that made this big Ginrou!

241
00:17:42,006 --> 00:17:43,3
Thank you!

242
00:17:46,077 --> 00:17:48,5
You'd better explain this later.

243
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:50,3
Yeah!

244
00:17:52,052 --> 00:17:55,1
...She did it.

245
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,9
That's...!

246
00:18:16,005 --> 00:18:17,0
Oogami!

247
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,8
Don't let her fool you!

248
00:18:39,028 --> 00:18:42,4
She is nothing like Ginrou-sama! She is a human!

249
00:18:43,028 --> 00:18:44,1
Boris?

250
00:18:44,054 --> 00:18:46,7
I was being fooled, too.

251
00:18:46,087 --> 00:18:50,7
She became a beastman thanks to a drug made by Sylvasta!

252
00:18:50,092 --> 00:18:54,3
She pretended to be Ginrou-sama and tricked all of us!

253
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:59,2
A human dared to trick us with the sacred Ginrou!

254
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:03,1
A human?
Ginrou-sama is a human...?

255
00:19:03,026 --> 00:19:05,2
No way...
Were we tricked?

256
00:19:05,089 --> 00:19:09,3
She tried to trick and control all the noble beastmen!

257
00:19:09,052 --> 00:19:13,2
We were tricked! By a damn human!

258
00:19:13,036 --> 00:19:15,7
There is no forgiving something like this!

259
00:19:20,061 --> 00:19:22,1
It's the work of a human!

260
00:19:22,024 --> 00:19:24,8
Humans want to destroy beastmen using those weapons!

261
00:20:05,016 --> 00:20:06,7
Nazuna!

262
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:09,6
Thank you!

263
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:20,2
Just like planned.

264
00:20:24,047 --> 00:20:26,8
Damn! They keep coming...

265
00:20:29,056 --> 00:20:30,8
Oogami!

266
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,7
This is...!

267
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:52,1
I was...

268
00:20:53,075 --> 00:20:55,6
...unable to save them again...?

269
00:20:56,033 --> 00:20:59,0
How am I the protector of beastmen?!

270
00:21:02,063 --> 00:21:04,0
I...

271
00:21:05,072 --> 00:21:07,8
...am useless...

272
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:13,8
I... I...!

273
00:21:20,086 --> 00:21:21,6
Shirou?

274
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,4
Oogami...

275
00:21:28,057 --> 00:21:29,9
Stop, Oogami!

276
00:21:33,095 --> 00:21:36,5
Shirou, stop!

277
00:21:40,075 --> 00:21:42,0
Shir...

278
00:21:48,005 --> 00:21:50,3
Michiru!
