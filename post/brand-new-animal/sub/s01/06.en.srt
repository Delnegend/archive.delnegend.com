Gem!

4
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,8
I told you not to shower while in beast mode, your feathers clog everything up!

5
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,3
Let me shower how I want.

6
00:01:09,056 --> 00:01:14,8
Breaking such a simple promise... Ginrou-sama is watching, you know!

7
00:01:15,053 --> 00:01:17,0
Ginrou-sama...

8
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:20,2
Michiru, you don't even know about Ginrou-sama?

9
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:22,6
I just know about him by name...

10
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:25,6
That won't do! Let me explain.

11
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:31,5
Depending on the era, humans and beastmen have lived with certain distance between them...

12
00:01:31,092 --> 00:01:35,2
...but no matter the era, beastmen have always gone through a crisis.

13
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:38,5
That's when a savior appeared...

14
00:01:38,089 --> 00:01:41,3
That's Ginrou-sama.

15
00:01:41,047 --> 00:01:47,8
A worldwide legend saying Ginrou-sama has saved us has existed for as much as a thousand years.

16
00:01:48,023 --> 00:01:50,0
Did you draw this, Mr. Gem?

17
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:52,9
I'll make a living out of this once I'm old.

18
00:01:53,007 --> 00:01:54,9
Don't mistify her!

19
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,8
Huh? You're leaving?

20
00:01:57,099 --> 00:01:59,1
Hey, are you listening?!

21
00:01:59,024 --> 00:02:00,5
Guess I'll go as well.

22
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,2
Hey, you two.

23
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,5
Here.

24
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:11,2
You always give this to me, but what is it?

25
00:02:11,088 --> 00:02:16,7
It's a charm for safety, to give to Ginrou-sama in case he comes to your aid.

26
00:02:17,022 --> 00:02:19,7
I see~ Thank you!

27
00:02:23,068 --> 00:02:24,9
Ah! You'll be cursed!

28
00:02:25,043 --> 00:02:30,6
There's no way there's a god that won't save people if you don't give it food.

29
00:02:30,081 --> 00:02:33,8
Everyone believes it, so shouldn't you be more respectful?

30
00:02:34,044 --> 00:02:36,8
That's why you have no friends.

31
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:39,8
You don't have any, either.

32
00:02:40,032 --> 00:02:42,3
I had many friends.

33
00:02:42,049 --> 00:02:46,8
I also had a very close friend, and she's super cute!

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,7
Why so proud?

35
00:02:49,004 --> 00:02:51,5
I mean, it's my pride.

36
00:02:52,029 --> 00:02:53,3
What's your name?

37
00:02:53,075 --> 00:02:54,5
Nazuna!

38
00:02:54,063 --> 00:02:56,9
Even if you read it upside down...!
It's Nazuna!

39
00:02:57,005 --> 00:02:59,0
My dream is your dream!

40
00:02:59,017 --> 00:03:01,9
No matter how you look at it, I'm an idol in every direction!

41
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:03,9
I'm Nazuna Hiwatashi!

42
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:07,9
That'll definitely catch on!

43
00:03:08,006 --> 00:03:09,6
Come on, you should audition!

44
00:03:10,035 --> 00:03:12,5
I don't wanna be chosen by anyone.

45
00:03:12,065 --> 00:03:14,3
I'd rather be the one choosing.

46
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,9
Ah, you're scared.

47
00:03:16,011 --> 00:03:16,8
Huh?

48
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:19,6
We almost died due to a single accident!

49
00:03:19,078 --> 00:03:21,4
Nothing can scare us anymore!

50
00:03:21,078 --> 00:03:26,3
There's a chance in adversity! Come on, you should become a real idol!

51
00:03:26,066 --> 00:03:29,2
H-hey... That's dangerous!

52
00:03:29,066 --> 00:03:32,4
I'm not giving up on basketball...

53
00:03:32,054 --> 00:03:36,8
...so let's make it to the top in our own fields!

54
00:03:37,025 --> 00:03:39,5
We can become anything we want!

55
00:03:40,067 --> 00:03:43,6
Hm... You're amazing, Michiru.

56
00:03:45,018 --> 00:03:48,1
...But one day, right in front of me...

57
00:03:50,052 --> 00:03:52,9
...right in front of me, she was abducted.

58
00:03:53,077 --> 00:03:54,7
...wait, what?

59
00:03:55,006 --> 00:03:58,0
If you're looking for Oogami, he went to the mayor's.

60
00:03:59,007 --> 00:04:00,5
Here.
Huh?

61
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:03,3
It's this month's phone bill.

62
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:05,9
So I pay you for that, too?

63
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,3
If ya can't pay it, then earn it.

64
00:04:09,066 --> 00:04:14,6
I'm overpricing this product to sell it to those slum fools.

65
00:04:18,071 --> 00:04:22,9
I hate it... Having to take part in a crime just to pay for my phone.

66
00:04:23,005 --> 00:04:24,0
Michiru!

67
00:04:24,051 --> 00:04:25,3
Jackie!

68
00:04:25,097 --> 00:04:26,8
That's...

69
00:04:26,093 --> 00:04:28,8
Look at this water purifier!

70
00:04:28,097 --> 00:04:32,2
They say it can even turn muddy water into mineral water!

71
00:04:32,035 --> 00:04:33,8
I bought it with a loan!

72
00:04:34,002 --> 00:04:36,1
With a lifetime payment plan!

73
00:04:36,023 --> 00:04:37,1
Hey.

74
00:04:37,052 --> 00:04:39,2
Which one of you is "Jackie"?

75
00:04:41,003 --> 00:04:43,6
I told you lifetime payments were bad!

76
00:04:43,078 --> 00:04:47,4
I mean, when I woke up from the shopping spree dazzle...

77
00:04:49,058 --> 00:04:53,2
It won't really matter even if I just start with you guys...

78
00:04:53,037 --> 00:04:55,4
...but I'll make an example out of you.

79
00:04:56,087 --> 00:05:01,7
Anyone who pushes the paying date even a day will be met with fire from now on.

80
00:05:08,001 --> 00:05:10,8
Jackie! Hey, move it!

81
00:05:11,006 --> 00:05:12,3
Jackie!

82
00:05:17,081 --> 00:05:19,7
Hey, what's that?

83
00:05:34,058 --> 00:05:37,4
Stop at once, lost beastmen.

84
00:05:38,012 --> 00:05:39,3
The hell are you?

85
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:42,7
Beastmen hurting other beastmen...

86
00:05:42,084 --> 00:05:45,4
That's low even for humans.

87
00:05:45,059 --> 00:05:47,5
What the hell are you blabbering on about?

88
00:05:48,018 --> 00:05:50,9
Those who don't pay up aren't beastmen or humans...

89
00:05:51,005 --> 00:05:55,0
They're trash! Shouldn't you take out the trash?

90
00:05:55,056 --> 00:05:57,1
They are not trash.

91
00:05:57,048 --> 00:06:00,3
We are all noble beastmen.

92
00:06:00,044 --> 00:06:02,8
You must not forget that honor.

93
00:06:02,094 --> 00:06:04,9
Ginrou-sama is watching.

94
00:06:05,015 --> 00:06:06,5
Are you stupid?

95
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:09,7
Ginrou is just a fairytale made up by weaklings!

96
00:06:11,074 --> 00:06:13,1
Rejoice!

97
00:06:13,028 --> 00:06:17,2
We will show the silver light even to unenlightened beastmen like you!

98
00:06:21,092 --> 00:06:25,4
Silver wolf guru, Déesse Louve!

99
00:06:25,055 --> 00:06:29,6
She has descended into Animacity, the capital of the beastmen!

100
00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:32,6
I don't care if you're a guru or whatever. Stay back!

101
00:06:32,076 --> 00:06:35,2
If you interfere, I'll burn you all as well!

102
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,3
Jackie!

103
00:06:40,052 --> 00:06:42,4
Burn! Burn!

104
00:06:42,077 --> 00:06:44,8
Hot! Hot! It's hot!

105
00:06:44,094 --> 00:06:48,3
My flesh is burning! What a nice smell~

106
00:06:59,029 --> 00:07:01,6
It's Ginrou!
It's Ginrou-sama!

107
00:07:02,008 --> 00:07:05,7
What are you all doing?! Shoot, shoot them!

108
00:07:08,097 --> 00:07:10,5
It's no use! We can't shoot!

109
00:07:10,068 --> 00:07:12,1
Please forgive us!

110
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,9
Get it together, you two!

111
00:07:21,044 --> 00:07:23,0
That's Ginrou...

112
00:07:23,048 --> 00:07:25,9
Ginrou-sama is the god of beastmen!

113
00:07:26,011 --> 00:07:29,1
She will erase your troubles and fears by way of the silver light!

114
00:07:29,028 --> 00:07:32,8
Worship our guardian deity, Ginrou-sama!

115
00:07:43,012 --> 00:07:47,5
Déesse Louve! She is the maiden of Ginrou!

116
00:07:47,096 --> 00:07:51,1
The silver light be with you.

117
00:07:51,026 --> 00:07:52,5
Let's all shine together.

118
00:07:53,013 --> 00:07:55,0
Hold on, that's Nazuna!

119
00:07:55,051 --> 00:07:57,8
Heeeey, Nazuna! Nazuna!

120
00:07:57,093 --> 00:08:00,3
It's me! Look! It's... H-hold on...

121
00:08:00,052 --> 00:08:04,3
What are you doing? H-hold on...!
Even if you read it upside down~?!

122
00:08:12,015 --> 00:08:13,4
Back down.

123
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:18,4
I feel great evil coming from this animal.

124
00:08:18,062 --> 00:08:21,8
You must not get close until I say otherwise.

125
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,0
Michiru? I knew it was you, Michiru!

126
00:08:33,067 --> 00:08:37,3
Why are you here? To think you also became a beastman...

127
00:08:37,051 --> 00:08:38,7
Nazuna...

128
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,6
Uh, I mean, this is...

129
00:08:43,002 --> 00:08:44,8
Thank god you're alive!

130
00:08:45,052 --> 00:08:48,0
You're okay! Thank god!

131
00:08:48,065 --> 00:08:50,1
Michiru...

132
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:54,0
A tanuki?

133
00:08:54,065 --> 00:08:56,3
I-I'm a raccoon.

134
00:08:56,049 --> 00:08:58,6
For some reason, I switched a little later...

135
00:08:59,003 --> 00:09:01,1
I've been living here for a while...

136
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,9
Déesse Louve!

137
00:09:05,033 --> 00:09:06,1
Come with me!

138
00:09:07,054 --> 00:09:09,4
Eh? H-hold on!

139
00:09:14,034 --> 00:09:17,0
Is it okay to just leave those guys be?

140
00:09:17,022 --> 00:09:18,5
I guess...

141
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,7
Are you...
Hey.

142
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:24,7
You're a tanuki! Why'd you say you were a raccoon?

143
00:09:38,086 --> 00:09:41,4
Aah, there's no way you're a raccoon!

144
00:09:41,099 --> 00:09:46,0
I mean, you're a silver wolf, meanwhile I'm just a tanuki...

145
00:09:46,021 --> 00:09:47,7
Hold on a sec.

146
00:09:55,084 --> 00:09:58,5
I'm not a silver wolf. I'm a fox.

147
00:09:58,084 --> 00:10:01,8
A fox? Were you transformed?

148
00:10:01,097 --> 00:10:06,0
Keep it a secret! I'll be in big trouble if anyone finds out.

149
00:10:06,056 --> 00:10:08,4
Okay, got it.

150
00:10:08,073 --> 00:10:12,4
Michiru... Are you maybe unable to return to your human form?

151
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:16,8
I couldn't at first, but now I can.

152
00:10:17,024 --> 00:10:19,8
Well, but I mean, why are you in beast form?

153
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,9
Come on. Isn't it more convenient to be like this?

154
00:10:23,003 --> 00:10:27,3
I know! Come to my house! I have lots of things to tell you!

155
00:10:27,046 --> 00:10:28,6
You live here?

156
00:10:28,091 --> 00:10:31,8
Yeah!
Really?! Let's go then!

157
00:10:32,017 --> 00:10:34,0
Yeah, let's go!

158
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,6
The Silver Wolf Order.

159
00:10:36,017 --> 00:10:41,5
They're a religious group that serve Ginrou. They search for beastmen freedom and pilgrimage through many countries.

160
00:10:41,084 --> 00:10:45,5
I heard rumors, but to think the guru is actually Ginrou...

161
00:10:46,018 --> 00:10:48,0
A complete beast form...

162
00:10:48,043 --> 00:10:51,9
A normal beastman shouldn't be able to accomplish that.

163
00:10:53,023 --> 00:10:54,9
Are they welcome despite that?

164
00:10:55,036 --> 00:11:00,5
"Any beastman is welcome" is this city's motto.

165
00:11:01,057 --> 00:11:03,7
You don't like it?
I don't.

166
00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:06,7
Yeah. As expected.

167
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,9
I was putting off meeting them to do some research on them...

168
00:11:11,021 --> 00:11:14,9
...but I figure it'd be faster to see them directly.

169
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:18,4
So you saw me getting abducted?

170
00:11:18,084 --> 00:11:21,3
It was a bit far so I couldn't see well...

171
00:11:21,076 --> 00:11:25,8
...but you disappeared just after that, so I immediately got what happened.

172
00:11:26,047 --> 00:11:29,9
I thought things like "Are they gonna murder me?". It was super scary!

173
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:32,2
Becoming a beastman in the first place...

174
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,0
...anyone would panic.

175
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:35,1
Yeah, you're right.

176
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:39,6
I was taken to some sort of weird research facility...

177
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:42,8
...and the one who got me out of there was Boris Cliff.

178
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:46,8
He knew I had transforming abilities.

179
00:11:46,095 --> 00:11:52,0
He had me train, and after that, I joined the Silver Wolf Order.

180
00:11:52,029 --> 00:11:54,7
He made me, who can transform into Ginrou, into a guru...

181
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:57,5
...and he settled with being my trainer.

182
00:11:57,096 --> 00:12:02,0
Was Boris that masked guy who was with you?

183
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,3
Yep!

184
00:12:03,043 --> 00:12:06,5
Is he trustworthy? Isn't he a bit shady?

185
00:12:07,005 --> 00:12:08,1
He's not shady.

186
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,7
Have you ever seen him without the mask?

187
00:12:11,018 --> 00:12:11,9
Nope.

188
00:12:12,018 --> 00:12:15,4
He's always using that mask? Isn't that kinda gross?

189
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,0
It's not.

190
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:21,4
I told you, Boris saved me from that facility.

191
00:12:22,003 --> 00:12:23,7
So he's not a bad guy.

192
00:12:24,007 --> 00:12:26,9
I see. I guess that's okay then.

193
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:36,3
What about you? How long have you been this way?

194
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:39,0
Just after it happened to you, I think.

195
00:12:39,013 --> 00:12:42,0
I holed up in my house and hid for a while...

196
00:12:42,017 --> 00:12:45,0
...but I wanted to look for a way to go back to normal...

197
00:12:45,043 --> 00:12:48,0
...and I thought I could find something by coming here.

198
00:12:48,047 --> 00:12:51,0
No one knows anything about this disease.

199
00:12:51,052 --> 00:12:52,6
Disease?

200
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,9
I think it's a disease. A beastman disease.

201
00:12:57,035 --> 00:12:59,4
A beastman disease, huh...

202
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:04,3
You seem to be having a lot of fun, though.

203
00:13:04,045 --> 00:13:08,2
What? Even like this, it's pretty rough!

204
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,9
Looks like you have lots of friends.

205
00:13:10,037 --> 00:13:13,7
Well, there are plenty of bad people here, too.

206
00:13:13,091 --> 00:13:16,9
But there are also people who come and help me out.

207
00:13:17,054 --> 00:13:18,7
I see~

208
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,2
Is that the mayor of Animacity?

209
00:13:24,038 --> 00:13:27,2
Yeah! I help her out sometimes.

210
00:13:29,014 --> 00:13:30,7
Hey!

211
00:13:30,097 --> 00:13:33,1
Let's live here together!

212
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:36,8
Leave all that guru stuff behind.

213
00:13:36,098 --> 00:13:42,2
I promise I'll find a cure, so before we go back to being human, let's try our best together!

214
00:13:44,061 --> 00:13:45,8
Ah, he's back!

215
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:49,6
Shirou, welcome home.
Thanks.

216
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:53,1
Hey, Shirou! Ms. Melissa!

217
00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:55,5
Could you let a friend stay here as well?

218
00:13:56,016 --> 00:13:57,2
A friend?

219
00:14:03,067 --> 00:14:04,6
No way.

220
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,5
What? Why?

221
00:14:06,067 --> 00:14:08,1
That woman can't be here.

222
00:14:08,088 --> 00:14:10,7
I'm going back.

223
00:14:10,089 --> 00:14:13,3
Ah... Wait, Nazuna!

224
00:14:13,072 --> 00:14:14,6
Hold it!

225
00:14:14,077 --> 00:14:17,2
Is that friend of yours... a human?

226
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:21,1
That's right. Nazuna and I have the same beastman disease.

227
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,6
Why is it okay if I'm here but Nazuna can't?

228
00:14:25,011 --> 00:14:28,7
That cult is fishy. There's definitely something else to it.

229
00:14:29,049 --> 00:14:31,0
You can't trust that woman, either.

230
00:14:31,062 --> 00:14:33,1
What the hell...

231
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:36,5
How about you kick me out as well?

232
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:45,8
Excuse me!

233
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,3
I'm Michiru Kagemori!

234
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:49,5
I want to join!

235
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,5
Boris.

236
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:05,2
I saw the guru earlier this evening and I was moved by it!

237
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,8
Please!

238
00:15:06,094 --> 00:15:08,6
Alright.

239
00:15:09,011 --> 00:15:11,7
Let Ginrou-sama guide you.

240
00:15:12,099 --> 00:15:16,4
Ugh, what's up with that? So gross.

241
00:15:16,074 --> 00:15:18,1
Welcome, sister.

242
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,0
Here. I'll guide you to your tent.

243
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:25,5
Ah, understood! Please do!

244
00:15:27,021 --> 00:15:31,8
That mayor is always busy. She is not willing to see us.

245
00:15:31,093 --> 00:15:33,0
Ah, I see.

246
00:15:34,018 --> 00:15:35,8
By the way, a moment ago...

247
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:38,9
A girl by the name of Kagemori came to join us...

248
00:15:40,002 --> 00:15:41,4
Do you know her?

249
00:15:41,077 --> 00:15:42,7
Who knows.

250
00:15:48,094 --> 00:15:50,8
Be beautiful.

251
00:15:52,003 --> 00:15:53,4
More beautiful than a god.

252
00:16:10,088 --> 00:16:14,8
Boris told me. I can't believe you joined the Silver Wolf Order.

253
00:16:15,051 --> 00:16:17,0
Let's run away together.

254
00:16:17,014 --> 00:16:19,2
That Boris guy's grossness isn't normal!

255
00:16:19,068 --> 00:16:22,0
You can't trust a guy like that!

256
00:16:22,018 --> 00:16:25,4
Michiru, you're pretty dumb.

257
00:16:25,056 --> 00:16:26,2
What?!

258
00:16:26,061 --> 00:16:28,6
Don't raise your voice!

259
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:31,0
It's best if you return.

260
00:16:32,036 --> 00:16:35,6
Animacity isn't willing to welcome a cult.

261
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:39,1
It's possible we might just have to leave.

262
00:16:39,024 --> 00:16:40,2
Why?

263
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:43,7
You're leaving too? Wouldn't you rather stay here?

264
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:48,0
Unlike you, I have no place to be here.

265
00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:51,4
That guy said I can't be here, didn't he?

266
00:16:51,055 --> 00:16:52,5
That's...

267
00:16:53,005 --> 00:16:55,3
The mayor is also unwilling to meet.

268
00:16:55,068 --> 00:16:58,6
The mayor? You went to see her?

269
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:02,4
More like she refused to receive me.

270
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:04,8
You can meet her.

271
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,8
Leave it to me.

272
00:17:06,098 --> 00:17:10,1
I know she's always at a particular store in the morning.

273
00:17:10,031 --> 00:17:12,0
Let's go meet her together.

274
00:17:12,048 --> 00:17:16,0
I'm sure she'll understand if she just talks with you properly.

275
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:18,8
Let's go before everyone wakes up.

276
00:17:19,016 --> 00:17:21,7
H-hey, hold on!

277
00:17:22,029 --> 00:17:24,0
We're up early tomorrow. Go sleep!

278
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:29,0
I'm sure it'll be okay. I can be with you like this...

279
00:17:38,084 --> 00:17:39,8
Mayor Rose!

280
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,3
Ms. Michiru.

281
00:17:41,064 --> 00:17:44,0
I brought a person who wanted to see you.

282
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:47,0
I was a human...!
I am the Silver Wolf Order Guru...

283
00:17:47,014 --> 00:17:48,4
Déesse Louve.

284
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:52,6
Thank you for making time to meet me.

285
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:58,6
Today, I am requesting for the permanent residence for the Silver Wolf Order members in Animacity.

286
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,4
Ah... Nazuna?

287
00:18:01,091 --> 00:18:03,7
If that's what you want to talk about...

288
00:18:04,008 --> 00:18:06,5
Why won't you listen to what I have to say?

289
00:18:06,066 --> 00:18:09,5
"Animacity welcomes every beastman".

290
00:18:09,071 --> 00:18:11,2
Is that pledge a lie?

291
00:18:11,063 --> 00:18:14,7
Ginrou is a sacred entity to beastmen.

292
00:18:14,088 --> 00:18:18,9
Playing with its existence is something unforgivable.

293
00:18:19,034 --> 00:18:22,4
This city is open to every beastman.

294
00:18:22,055 --> 00:18:27,2
But we don't need someone who deceives beastmen in this city.

295
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,1
No, that's...!

296
00:18:29,031 --> 00:18:31,4
It's true that I am a human.

297
00:18:31,061 --> 00:18:33,1
I'm not the legendary Ginrou.

298
00:18:33,057 --> 00:18:34,9
As expected.

299
00:18:35,003 --> 00:18:38,8
But does Ginrou exist in the first place?

300
00:18:38,099 --> 00:18:42,0
An immortal wolf beastman living for more than a thousand years...

301
00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:45,3
He's a beastman, but he takes the form of a wolf.

302
00:18:45,045 --> 00:18:47,4
There's no way there's someone like that.

303
00:18:47,058 --> 00:18:53,7
But by having them hold onto that fictitious existence, you can keep beastmen in check.

304
00:18:53,084 --> 00:18:56,8
They were looking for salvation. Am I wrong?

305
00:18:58,047 --> 00:19:01,3
That's why I'm making that lie a reality.

306
00:19:01,047 --> 00:19:03,3
For the sake of beastmen's happiness.

307
00:19:03,093 --> 00:19:05,9
I'm not fabricating hope.

308
00:19:06,006 --> 00:19:08,6
We are instilling hope into them.

309
00:19:08,077 --> 00:19:12,1
Animacity must be needing that very hope.

310
00:19:12,031 --> 00:19:14,9
Isn't that right, Mayor Rose Barbarei?

311
00:19:15,094 --> 00:19:16,9
Nazuna...

312
00:19:18,086 --> 00:19:22,7
Your friend is very interesting.

313
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:27,4
Come to the city hall this afternoon. We'll begin the settlement procedures.

314
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:29,4
Understood.

315
00:19:35,084 --> 00:19:38,3
Hmm! What a nice morning~

316
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:40,6
I'm hungry.

317
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,5
Come on...

318
00:19:42,068 --> 00:19:43,3
What?

319
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:47,9
I should be the one saying "what"! You deceived me! What's with that attitude?!

320
00:19:48,006 --> 00:19:49,2
I deceived you?

321
00:19:49,035 --> 00:19:54,6
I mean, I thought you were overworking yourself as a guru, so I pitied you and thought about helping you.

322
00:19:54,081 --> 00:19:56,1
So what was that just now?

323
00:19:56,065 --> 00:19:58,4
Did you plan to use me?

324
00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:01,4
Scary!

325
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,4
What?

326
00:20:02,082 --> 00:20:06,6
You become sharp-tongued as soon as things don't go exactly how you thought.

327
00:20:08,037 --> 00:20:11,2
I would've been fine even if I didn't rely on you.

328
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:14,7
You even looked so smug when you had me meet the mayor~

329
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,6
You said you weren't able to meet the mayor...

330
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:21,6
You think the mayor acknowledged me because I relied on you?

331
00:20:21,076 --> 00:20:23,5
There's no way!

332
00:20:23,068 --> 00:20:25,5
It was decided way before all of this!

333
00:20:26,005 --> 00:20:28,6
I'm sure she investigated our cult, either way.

334
00:20:30,085 --> 00:20:34,0
That's why, even if you weren't involved...

335
00:20:34,014 --> 00:20:36,2
...the result would've been more or less the same.

336
00:20:36,086 --> 00:20:39,2
Then why did you ask me to do it?

337
00:20:39,036 --> 00:20:41,4
I didn't ask you to.

338
00:20:41,061 --> 00:20:45,8
You did what you wanted based on your assumptions from the start.

339
00:20:45,095 --> 00:20:46,9
Assumptions?

340
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:51,2
I didn't even say anything about quitting my guru status in the first place, did I?

341
00:20:53,008 --> 00:20:55,3
See? You don't get it.

342
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:58,6
I don't even want to quit. I'm finally an idol.

343
00:20:59,017 --> 00:21:00,1
An idol?

344
00:21:00,063 --> 00:21:02,8
Being a guru is like being an idol!

345
00:21:02,097 --> 00:21:06,4
So many beastmen worship me, praise me...

346
00:21:06,055 --> 00:21:08,8
They look for hope and dreams in me!

347
00:21:08,093 --> 00:21:10,5
Isn't that like being an idol?

348
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:12,2
What the hell...

349
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:15,0
Are you okay with being used as an idol by that gross grandpa?

350
00:21:15,052 --> 00:21:17,1
Besides, saying a guru is an idol...

351
00:21:17,023 --> 00:21:18,7
You haven't changed a bit, Michiru.

352
00:21:21,082 --> 00:21:26,7
When something happens right before your eyes, you jump into it without a second thought.

353
00:21:26,091 --> 00:21:29,7
That part of you hasn't changed at all.

354
00:21:30,003 --> 00:21:31,7
Jumping in based on assumptions...

355
00:21:31,087 --> 00:21:35,2
...deciding to pity someone all by yourself...

356
00:21:35,033 --> 00:21:37,5
...and thinking about saving someone just like that...

357
00:21:37,067 --> 00:21:40,9
Isn't that just to stroke your ego?

358
00:21:41,004 --> 00:21:42,0
That's not...

359
00:21:42,063 --> 00:21:46,2
Also, Boris isn't as gross as you think.

360
00:21:46,034 --> 00:21:47,3
That's not true.

361
00:21:47,047 --> 00:21:50,0
See, you're pushing it.

362
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:54,5
I decided to do anything to achieve my dreams.

363
00:21:54,081 --> 00:21:56,5
I'm not Nazuna right now.

364
00:21:56,094 --> 00:21:59,9
I'm the Silver Wolf Maiden, Déesse Louve!

365
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,9
Okay... I got it.

366
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,9
That's enough then.

367
00:22:05,011 --> 00:22:05,8
However!

368
00:22:06,053 --> 00:22:11,0
I have no friend named Déesse-whatever!
