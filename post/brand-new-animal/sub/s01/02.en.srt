1
00:00:03,074 --> 00:00:06,5
I am human... I was human!

2
00:00:07,004 --> 00:00:08,7
You look like a tanuki.

3
00:00:08,083 --> 00:00:10,7
I-I'm not! I'm a raccoon!

4
00:00:10,091 --> 00:00:15,0
If you were a raccoon, you'd have stripes on your tail. You're a tanuki no matter what.

5
00:00:15,017 --> 00:00:16,0
I don't like tanukis!

6
00:00:19,042 --> 00:00:20,2
Follow me.

7
00:00:31,085 --> 00:00:34,4
He got here first, huh...

8
00:00:34,098 --> 00:00:39,9
♪～

9
00:01:29,087 --> 00:01:34,8
～♪

10
00:01:38,088 --> 00:01:40,1
Hold on!

11
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,0
Where are you taking m--

12
00:01:44,084 --> 00:01:47,9
Ah, uh, I-I mean...

13
00:01:48,005 --> 00:01:50,3
How long do you plan on staying that way?

14
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:52,4
Hurry up and change back to a human.

15
00:01:52,056 --> 00:01:53,7
That's...

16
00:01:53,089 --> 00:01:55,3
You can't?

17
00:02:00,002 --> 00:02:02,2
I thought he was older...

18
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:07,6
Huh?

19
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,7
What's wrong?

20
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:12,8
No one's in their beast forms...

21
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:14,2
That's a given.

22
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,7
I mean, just a bit ago...

23
00:02:16,008 --> 00:02:18,7
That's because that was a festival. This is normal.

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,3
Whaaaaat? Are you kidding?

25
00:02:21,031 --> 00:02:22,1
What do you mean?

26
00:02:22,055 --> 00:02:26,4
I thought everyone used their beast form all the time...

27
00:02:27,059 --> 00:02:30,8
Don't say something so human-like.

28
00:02:32,035 --> 00:02:34,4
Well, I am a human.

29
00:02:41,086 --> 00:02:42,8
We're here.

30
00:02:48,078 --> 00:02:50,7
Yep, she's a beastman.

31
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:53,4
What? Just with that?

32
00:02:53,091 --> 00:02:58,0
A beastmen marker is a simple but effective way of examination.

33
00:02:58,021 --> 00:03:00,2
You're without a doubt a beastman.

34
00:03:00,058 --> 00:03:03,5
That's not true! I'm a human!

35
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:09,4
Even without using a marker, you can clearly tell you're a beastman, though...

36
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:11,9
I'm really a human!

37
00:03:12,072 --> 00:03:15,6
I was a normal human a year ago...

38
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:18,1
Then I became like this out of nowhere...

39
00:03:18,027 --> 00:03:19,6
That's not possible.

40
00:03:20,006 --> 00:03:23,1
Humans are humans. Beastmen are beastmen.

41
00:03:23,023 --> 00:03:26,4
It's decided from the beginning. It doesn't change like that.

42
00:03:26,057 --> 00:03:28,8
I'm sure it's a disease or something!

43
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,3
A disease?

44
00:03:29,057 --> 00:03:32,0
Yeah! A disease! A beastman disease!

45
00:03:32,016 --> 00:03:34,5
There must be people like that in this town, right?

46
00:03:34,091 --> 00:03:36,9
There's no one like that.

47
00:03:38,012 --> 00:03:40,1
Well, I've never heard of a case like that.

48
00:03:46,038 --> 00:03:50,7
Lately, it seems there have been strange diseases regarding human delusions...

49
00:03:50,088 --> 00:03:52,2
...so I recommend getting check--

50
00:03:52,034 --> 00:03:54,2
Not that kind of disease!

51
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:58,0
Gem, don't say it like that!

52
00:03:58,018 --> 00:04:01,4
I swear you have no delicacy at all...

53
00:04:01,056 --> 00:04:04,5
I'm really sorry. You're Ms. Kagemori, right?

54
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:06,6
Ah, yes! I'm Michiru Kagemori.

55
00:04:07,003 --> 00:04:09,0
I'm Melissa.

56
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:13,9
You see Gem like this, but he's the Director for the Beastmen Life Association.

57
00:04:14,012 --> 00:04:18,0
It's also our job to help newcomers with their troubles.

58
00:04:18,016 --> 00:04:21,1
In any case, you'll go to the council tomorrow for your Beast Registration...

59
00:04:21,012 --> 00:04:23,2
...so make sure to fill this in, yeah?

60
00:04:25,021 --> 00:04:29,8
I-I'm telling you, I'm really not a beastman! A Beast Registration...

61
00:04:29,085 --> 00:04:32,0
Even so...

62
00:04:34,022 --> 00:04:35,9
That's it! My student credential!

63
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:37,4
Student credential?

64
00:04:37,097 --> 00:04:40,7
My blood type and species are written in my student credential.

65
00:04:40,089 --> 00:04:43,3
Beastmen and humans have different blood types...

66
00:04:43,044 --> 00:04:46,5
...it's clearly written so there are no mistakes when transfusing blood, so...

67
00:04:51,053 --> 00:04:54,4
Right... It was in my wallet...

68
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:57,6
Oh bother... You'd better give up on that.

69
00:04:57,078 --> 00:04:58,7
No waaaay!

70
00:04:59,016 --> 00:05:03,5
If something gets taken from you in Animacity, the chances of getting it back are slim.

71
00:05:03,062 --> 00:05:07,7
How about you go sleep? You look very tired...

72
00:05:12,038 --> 00:05:14,9
In any case, this'll have to be enough for today.

73
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:17,2
The bed is clean, so...

74
00:05:17,064 --> 00:05:19,9
It's enough! I've always been homeless, so it's fine.

75
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:23,8
If there's anything you don't get, ask Shirou over here.

76
00:05:26,035 --> 00:05:28,7
Whoa! Ouch...

77
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:31,9
Kuro...

78
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:39,1
We're getting up early tomorrow. Get some rest.

79
00:05:41,012 --> 00:05:44,5
Shirou isn't too sociable, but he's not a bad guy.

80
00:05:45,021 --> 00:05:47,4
Oh, he's named Shirou...

81
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,9
Oh, you haven't asked him?

82
00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:53,4
Shirou Oogami, he's our social worker.

83
00:05:53,059 --> 00:05:56,8
Shirou will take you to the council tomorrow.

84
00:05:56,097 --> 00:05:58,1
Oogami...

85
00:06:00,056 --> 00:06:03,1
We don't have a bathtub, but you can use the shower, right?

86
00:06:03,046 --> 00:06:04,3
Oh, yeah!

87
00:06:10,065 --> 00:06:14,0
This is not what I thought would happen...

88
00:06:25,046 --> 00:06:26,8
It's packed...

89
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,1
See ya.

90
00:06:28,025 --> 00:06:29,6
Eh? you're leaving?

91
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,5
I also have some things to attend to. I just took the chance to take you here.

92
00:06:33,071 --> 00:06:34,8
Do the rest yourself.

93
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,3
Move!

94
00:06:37,084 --> 00:06:38,7
I'm in a hurry.

95
00:06:41,055 --> 00:06:43,2
I come first!

96
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:46,9
What? Are you kidding me?!

97
00:06:47,035 --> 00:06:48,6
What? What's going on?

98
00:06:48,094 --> 00:06:52,1
Younglings like to show off their power.

99
00:06:52,032 --> 00:06:54,4
No no no, that's not what I mean...

100
00:06:54,061 --> 00:06:56,6
Are there no rules?
There are.

101
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:07,9
The stronger one wins. It's a simple rule.

102
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:11,2
T-there's no way...

103
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:14,0
Your turn won't come up if you just stand there.

104
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:20,5
Sigh... I didn't think it this city would be like this...

105
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:26,9
I feel I've seen him around...

106
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:31,4
Oh, could he be...?

107
00:07:33,015 --> 00:07:35,3
Thank you for capturing the bomber.

108
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:40,2
They were terrorists hired by an anti-beastman organization.

109
00:07:40,036 --> 00:07:43,5
If money is involved, even our fellow beastmen would accept such a job.

110
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,7
It's sad.

111
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:48,3
Those guys are a disgrace to beastmen.

112
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:53,2
By the way, I have one more request.

113
00:07:59,086 --> 00:08:00,4
I knew it!

114
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,5
What are you doing?!

115
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:08,2
Give me back my wallet!

116
00:08:08,056 --> 00:08:09,6
Iunno what yer talkin' about!

117
00:08:10,006 --> 00:08:11,6
There's no way you don't know!

118
00:08:11,077 --> 00:08:13,4
You stole it from me yesterday!

119
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,9
Ya think I remember that far back?!

120
00:08:15,006 --> 00:08:16,9
Far back?! It was yesterday!

121
00:08:17,011 --> 00:08:20,1
In this town, it's pointless even if you're talking about yesterday.

122
00:08:22,091 --> 00:08:24,4
Uh... Where have I...

123
00:08:27,037 --> 00:08:28,9
Ah, you're that weasel--
Mink!

124
00:08:29,037 --> 00:08:32,0
Not a weasel, but Mari the Mink!

125
00:08:34,062 --> 00:08:36,7
Tanukis really are half-witted, huh?

126
00:08:36,088 --> 00:08:38,3
See ya never!

127
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,9
So you were an accomplice!

128
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:45,2
You just "happened" to see me? You're an accomplice so you came to help him, right?

129
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:49,8
It was just a coincidence, a coincidence... It's because this city is so small!

130
00:08:51,033 --> 00:08:53,0
Gimme some credit.

131
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:56,4
Who do you have to thank for making it into this city?

132
00:08:56,081 --> 00:08:58,8
I paid you properly, didn't I?!

133
00:08:58,094 --> 00:09:00,3
Okay, okay...

134
00:09:01,003 --> 00:09:03,5
Trust is the priority in this business, after all.

135
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,1
I'll tell you as a service.

136
00:09:05,095 --> 00:09:08,0
For lost things, Rabbit Town is the place.

137
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,9
Everyone gathers around there.

138
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,5
Rabbit Town?

139
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:16,0
Yeah. Pay a visit to Gran Grandma over there.

140
00:09:23,034 --> 00:09:25,4
This feels nothing like a "rabbit" town...

141
00:09:26,001 --> 00:09:27,9
Huh? What's up with ya?

142
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:29,4
E-excuse me...

143
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:33,1
Do you happen to know where Gran Grandma could be located?

144
00:09:41,069 --> 00:09:45,3
You got some guts showing up in your beast form here.

145
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:48,1
Don't play dumb.

146
00:09:48,028 --> 00:09:51,4
In gang terms, changing to your beast form means you wanna fight.

147
00:09:51,054 --> 00:09:55,3
Showing up in beast form means you're looking for a fight, ain't that right?!

148
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,7
Y-y-you misunderstand!

149
00:09:56,087 --> 00:10:01,1
I can't control it myself, so I can't go back from this form!

150
00:10:01,063 --> 00:10:03,3
You can't go back?

151
00:10:03,046 --> 00:10:06,6
You're not a baby! Are you mocking me?

152
00:10:06,093 --> 00:10:10,2
I'm not mocking anyone! I really can't!

153
00:10:10,035 --> 00:10:12,1
I was a human up until last year...

154
00:10:12,052 --> 00:10:14,5
So you were...

155
00:10:16,002 --> 00:10:19,4
Did you think such a poor excuse would fly?

156
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,1
I can prove it!

157
00:10:21,027 --> 00:10:24,2
There's a student credential in the wallet that was stolen from me yesterday...

158
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,9
I came here to look for that!

159
00:10:26,036 --> 00:10:28,9
Why do you think it's here?

160
00:10:29,032 --> 00:10:31,7
I heard it from a weas... from Ms. Itami.

161
00:10:31,091 --> 00:10:33,4
She said you might know...

162
00:10:33,095 --> 00:10:36,2
Huh, so it was Mari...

163
00:10:36,071 --> 00:10:39,3
Ah, that's it! That's my wallet!

164
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:41,9
Look at the student credential inside and you'll see! I'm actually...

165
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:43,5
You're a student?

166
00:10:44,071 --> 00:10:46,8
She asked if you're a student!

167
00:10:47,001 --> 00:10:48,5
T-that's right...

168
00:10:49,001 --> 00:10:50,5
So that means...

169
00:10:50,068 --> 00:10:52,8
You can at least read and write, right?

170
00:10:53,097 --> 00:10:55,2
I can...

171
00:10:55,064 --> 00:10:58,1
I don't mind giving this back, but...

172
00:10:58,027 --> 00:11:01,9
In exchange, can I ask you for a favor?

173
00:11:03,023 --> 00:11:06,4
Teach these kids to read and write.

174
00:11:06,053 --> 00:11:08,7
There were children here...?

175
00:11:09,016 --> 00:11:10,8
Betrayed by men...

176
00:11:10,095 --> 00:11:13,7
People like me... Washed up people...

177
00:11:13,091 --> 00:11:15,8
They all end up in Rabbit Town.

178
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,7
Beastwomen who have nowhere else to go...

179
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:23,0
...more or less have to choose the dangerous path.

180
00:11:23,084 --> 00:11:28,5
These kids must also strongly feel that bitterness.

181
00:11:28,092 --> 00:11:30,5
If they can read and write...

182
00:11:30,072 --> 00:11:32,8
...they can open up the path for a better tomorrow.

183
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:36,8
If you do that for me, I'll return your wallet.

184
00:11:36,093 --> 00:11:37,8
Got it.

185
00:11:38,023 --> 00:11:39,8
I will do it!

186
00:11:41,048 --> 00:11:43,0
Can anyone read this?

187
00:11:45,061 --> 00:11:46,9
Is there?

188
00:11:49,007 --> 00:11:51,1
Yes! You!

189
00:11:51,028 --> 00:11:52,4
Poop!

190
00:11:53,099 --> 00:11:55,9
Okay. That's somewhat wrong.

191
00:11:56,024 --> 00:11:58,3
This is "Mi", "Chi", "Ru"!

192
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:02,2
It reads Michiru! That's my name.

193
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:06,3
Okay, can anyone write their own name?

194
00:12:07,076 --> 00:12:09,3
What's your name?

195
00:12:09,047 --> 00:12:10,3
Youta.

196
00:12:10,076 --> 00:12:12,9
Youta, I see.

197
00:12:17,018 --> 00:12:18,8
This is "Youta".

198
00:12:19,002 --> 00:12:20,7
"Yo", "U", "Ta".

199
00:12:20,085 --> 00:12:21,8
Try writing it!

200
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:32,8
That's right! That's "Youta". It's your name.

201
00:12:36,024 --> 00:12:39,2
Who else wants to write their name?

202
00:13:11,003 --> 00:13:14,2
This place reeks of women like always.

203
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:26,1
Alright, let's first memorize all hiragana, okay?

204
00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:27,4
Hey, are you listening?

205
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:32,0
Wow, you're good at that! Is that a wolf?

206
00:13:32,021 --> 00:13:34,8
No, it's Ginrou-sama.

207
00:13:35,001 --> 00:13:36,0
Ginrou-sama?

208
00:13:36,051 --> 00:13:40,1
That's bad, Michiru. You don't even know Ginrou-sama?

209
00:13:40,031 --> 00:13:41,7
Nope, I don't know.

210
00:13:42,035 --> 00:13:44,4
It's the God of Beastmen!

211
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:47,5
When a beastman is really having a hard time...

212
00:13:47,065 --> 00:13:49,6
A silver wolf will come to the rescue!

213
00:13:50,032 --> 00:13:53,6
The story's been around since forever.

214
00:13:55,045 --> 00:13:57,4
Was that it, then...?

215
00:13:57,053 --> 00:13:59,2
Michiru, did you see it?

216
00:13:59,033 --> 00:14:00,5
No way! Really?!

217
00:14:00,066 --> 00:14:02,5
N-no, I didn't get a good look at...

218
00:14:04,016 --> 00:14:05,2
Huh?

219
00:14:09,034 --> 00:14:11,4
Hey, Kusakabe. What are you doing here?

220
00:14:11,092 --> 00:14:13,7
For business, obviously!

221
00:14:13,084 --> 00:14:16,5
Who would come here if it ain't for work?

222
00:14:16,068 --> 00:14:18,1
Sure, "work"...

223
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,8
You came for the money anyway, right?

224
00:14:20,022 --> 00:14:23,2
Didn't I tell you the money isn't here yet?

225
00:14:23,064 --> 00:14:25,3
"It's not here~"

226
00:14:25,052 --> 00:14:26,8
...yeah, right!

227
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:29,1
If ya don't have it, then make it!

228
00:14:29,031 --> 00:14:30,6
You women...

229
00:14:30,094 --> 00:14:35,0
Who do ya have to thank for being able to live in the Yakuza business? Think about it real hard!

230
00:14:35,015 --> 00:14:37,4
...What did you say?!
You wanna go?!

231
00:14:39,091 --> 00:14:41,1
Don't be childish, Kusakabe.

232
00:14:42,008 --> 00:14:43,6
B-Boss...

233
00:14:44,004 --> 00:14:47,4
I don't wanna fight with my woman colleagues.

234
00:14:47,067 --> 00:14:50,5
It's just a matter of paying up.

235
00:14:51,004 --> 00:14:55,5
Showing your face around here is a rare sight for sure, Flip.

236
00:14:55,097 --> 00:15:00,5
I thought I'd pay a visit to the fabled Gran Grandma once in a while.

237
00:15:00,072 --> 00:15:02,8
Sure you did.

238
00:15:03,001 --> 00:15:06,8
Even if you come out, I can't pay what I can't pay.

239
00:15:07,027 --> 00:15:08,9
Is that so?

240
00:15:09,006 --> 00:15:11,8
I heard you stocked up on some new animals.

241
00:15:13,048 --> 00:15:15,1
If you prepare those...

242
00:15:15,028 --> 00:15:17,2
...the money will start coming in.

243
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,8
Why do you know that?

244
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,5
Did you think you could hide it?

245
00:15:21,066 --> 00:15:24,5
Well, it seems the higher-ups have also caught wind of it.

246
00:15:25,004 --> 00:15:26,2
What?

247
00:15:26,066 --> 00:15:28,7
After all, women's work...

248
00:15:28,091 --> 00:15:30,7
...is pretty obvious.

249
00:15:30,088 --> 00:15:36,1
If you don't prepare them before packing them up, they won't even amount to a thousand yen.

250
00:15:36,026 --> 00:15:37,4
You got that, didn't you?

251
00:15:37,088 --> 00:15:40,7
You're able to keep yer business thanks to us!

252
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:49,5
What's going on? What are you planning to do with us?

253
00:15:50,002 --> 00:15:52,7
Thought I'd bring you all on a trip.

254
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:56,1
It can't be... You're gonna sell us?!

255
00:15:56,057 --> 00:15:58,8
Would've been nice if they managed to read some more...

256
00:15:58,099 --> 00:16:00,6
...so they could sell even higher.

257
00:16:01,016 --> 00:16:04,3
Turns out I had to dispatch them all now.

258
00:16:04,049 --> 00:16:06,8
So that's why you asked me to...

259
00:16:06,095 --> 00:16:09,3
They're your children! Are you for real?!

260
00:16:09,075 --> 00:16:13,3
I don't recall saying they were my children.

261
00:16:14,038 --> 00:16:16,3
Then, these kids...

262
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,6
They're children wo got lost...

263
00:16:18,076 --> 00:16:21,5
...or whose parents died when they got to Animacity.

264
00:16:22,076 --> 00:16:25,8
Are you... are you serious...?

265
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,5
That's horrible!

266
00:16:27,097 --> 00:16:32,2
Weaklings step on those weaker than them to live on.

267
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,4
That's the kind of place this is.

268
00:16:38,073 --> 00:16:40,1
Ginrou-sama, save us...!

269
00:16:40,057 --> 00:16:44,4
Asking a god for help won't solve anything. We have to fend off for ourselves!

270
00:16:47,091 --> 00:16:49,6
Everyone, hold on!

271
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:09,1
What an undisciplined tanuki.

272
00:17:10,064 --> 00:17:11,7
Roll up the cable!

273
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:21,8
This is it, huh.
No way!

274
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,5
Look, the driver's seat is closer now!

275
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:27,5
We mustn't give up!

276
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:31,2
No one will help us because we're in this city!

277
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:34,5
We must extend our own hands...

278
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:39,7
...and grab onto each other...!

279
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:43,4
No matter how hard you try, you can't close that distance!

280
00:17:52,027 --> 00:17:54,1
My... my arms are extending!

281
00:17:54,056 --> 00:17:57,5
Nngh...! Oh! I think I grabbed onto something!

282
00:17:57,065 --> 00:17:59,6
Aah! My hands are stretched out! Gross.

283
00:18:00,007 --> 00:18:02,6
That's amazing!
But your hands are gross.

284
00:18:02,074 --> 00:18:05,1
That "gross" was uncalled for! Ah, but I think...

285
00:18:05,024 --> 00:18:06,9
I grabbed onto some sort of lever!

286
00:18:07,016 --> 00:18:09,0
Come on...!

287
00:18:09,016 --> 00:18:11,4
Pull on the lever...!

288
00:18:11,095 --> 00:18:13,8
What... what's going on?!

289
00:18:13,095 --> 00:18:15,1
What a mess!

290
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:18,3
Come on, pull!

291
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,4
Alright, everyone, run!

292
00:18:34,052 --> 00:18:35,6
Hold it!

293
00:18:37,027 --> 00:18:39,1
What an interesting skill you have.

294
00:18:39,027 --> 00:18:41,5
You're really not a beastman, are you?

295
00:18:42,016 --> 00:18:42,9
Run!

296
00:18:44,069 --> 00:18:46,4
Ngh... Let go...!

297
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,7
Make it quick.

298
00:18:48,016 --> 00:18:49,2
Got it.

299
00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:02,8
...the hell are you?!

300
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:08,6
Ginrou...

301
00:19:09,076 --> 00:19:13,3
There is no forgiveness for those who sell beastmen to humans,

302
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:15,2
...even if it's a woman.

303
00:19:15,056 --> 00:19:17,6
Don't say that!

304
00:19:26,003 --> 00:19:29,5
I surrender. Be gentle with older people.

305
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:43,2
Looks like another success, Oogami.

306
00:19:43,075 --> 00:19:45,7
We'd be in serious trouble if you didn't...

307
00:19:45,088 --> 00:19:48,3
...manage to catch the tail of that beast gang.

308
00:19:48,047 --> 00:19:50,7
It was a request from the mayor.

309
00:19:51,009 --> 00:19:52,4
Where are the kids?

310
00:19:54,064 --> 00:19:55,8
Who's that?

311
00:19:55,097 --> 00:19:59,1
She's a newcomer. We're tending to her in the association.

312
00:19:59,069 --> 00:20:03,3
You got a rough welcome as soon as you got here, huh.

313
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:06,9
We'll be protecting the kids, so you don't need to worry.

314
00:20:07,003 --> 00:20:10,7
We have an institution for orphans, after all.

315
00:20:17,058 --> 00:20:18,8
What is it?

316
00:20:18,095 --> 00:20:22,2
Unforgivable! Trying to sell children...

317
00:20:23,063 --> 00:20:27,6
Even if you're a beastman, don't you have a human heart?!

318
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:30,7
Heh, I see.

319
00:20:30,088 --> 00:20:34,0
It really seems like you're not a beastman.

320
00:20:34,085 --> 00:20:36,1
What do you mean?

321
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:39,7
Living as a woman in the world of beastmen...

322
00:20:39,089 --> 00:20:42,3
Tell me that once you're know how rough it is.

323
00:20:52,024 --> 00:20:53,9
Why were you there?

324
00:20:54,011 --> 00:20:56,9
You saw it all from that building above, didn't you?

325
00:20:57,045 --> 00:20:58,2
Yeah.

326
00:20:59,004 --> 00:21:01,7
Why didn't you come to help back then?

327
00:21:01,091 --> 00:21:04,2
You knew we were gonna be sold, didn't you?!

328
00:21:04,067 --> 00:21:06,4
There was no evidence yet.

329
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:09,2
The only way to arrest them was to catch them in the act.

330
00:21:09,063 --> 00:21:11,9
What would you do if you didn't make it in time?

331
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:13,8
What would you do if the boat sailed?

332
00:21:13,093 --> 00:21:16,3
We could've been sold!

333
00:21:16,047 --> 00:21:18,9
Did you even think about those children?

334
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:21,1
I never miss.

335
00:21:21,023 --> 00:21:23,8
I will protect every beastwoman and child.

336
00:21:24,035 --> 00:21:26,1
Woman and child...

337
00:21:26,027 --> 00:21:30,1
Are guys really all that? Are men really all that?

338
00:21:30,048 --> 00:21:33,6
Look at that! I'm a human!

339
00:21:36,032 --> 00:21:38,0
"I never miss", yeah right...

340
00:21:38,091 --> 00:21:41,0
Do you see your mistake?

341
00:21:41,016 --> 00:21:43,7
I hate beastmen and this damned city!

342
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:47,3
I'll heal from this damn disease and get the hell away from this city!
