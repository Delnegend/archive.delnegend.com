00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.210
Michiru!

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.230
Michiru... This can't be...!

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.300
Oogami...

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:28.900
Hey...

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.670
Hey... Michiru!

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.850
Can you do that again?

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.330
Your howling is amazing.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.930
Mi... Michiru!

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.250
Ouch...!
<i>Oh! Sorry!</i>

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.500
Are your wounds okay?

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.400
Yeah... but you didn't bite my gorilla arm, so it was dangerous.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.010
Thank you. You saved me.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:18.850
Thank you, Michiru.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.470
<i>Oogami!</i>

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.930
The Mayor! And Pinga!

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.330
To the city hall!

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.080
Get on!

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.600
<i>As promised, Animacity is on lockdown.</i>

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.970
<i>This should ensure the safety of all citizens, right?</i>

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.280
Don't worry, Prime Minister.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.890
The beastmen will die as such before long.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.480
Japan would be the first in the world to resolve the beastman problem.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.900
So, Oogami had an outbreak like everyone else, but as soon as he bit you, he returned to normal?

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.070
That's right.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:05.700
Look at this.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.420
This is a sample from Yaba's blood that I found stored away.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.290
I'll mix it in with Michiru's blood.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.590
Her Beast Factor is rewriting other Beast Factors.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.600
The rampaging Beast Factor is returning to normal. In other words, Oogami returning to normal is thanks to Michiru.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.400
The Beast Factor in both of you has the ability to change forms at will.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.530
If we apply that to other Beast Factors, it will result in the neutralization of the beast form rampage.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.610
If we make a serum, we can cure the Nirvasyl Syndrome.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.280
Really?!

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.120
The Japanese Government will not come to our aid.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.870
This is our last chance.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.490
To the Medical Center.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.370
We can synthesize a serum there.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.580
We gotta hurry.
<i>I'm not going.</i>

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.040
If stress is relieved, an outbreak won't happen, right?

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.960
Are you going to the city?! It's too dangerous.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.760
I lied about me being Ginrou to everyone who believed in me.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.550
If I don't do something, I can't forgive myself.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.430
I'll help the girl, too.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.830
Leave the serum to me.
<i>Okay.</i>

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.850
I'll protect the city.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.110
Thank you.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.800
When we're done...
<i>We make a speech!</i>

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.110
Let's go.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.180
I'll take some blood from you. Get ready.

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.040
How long do you need?

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.800
Give me 8 hours.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.800
If the Beast Factor Termination Vaccine spreads before then, it's over.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.130
I'm going to stop Alan.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.300
Don't let anyone in.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:43.170
Shirou!

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.100
You have to stay.
<i>No!</i>

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.520
There's no use for me in waiting. Get that through your thick skull!

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:04.730
Where are your parents?

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.530
It'll be okay. A cure is being made now, so everyone will heal and go back to normal.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:13.360
Really?

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:21.260
Until then, listen to music or draw a bit. Do what makes you happy so your feelings don't go out of control.

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.190
Can you do that?

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.970
Alright, let's go play with your friends.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.180
I'll take this child with me.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.320
Please.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:35.600
Ms. Déesse Louve.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.810
Boris...

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.690
Please forgive me. It was all under Alan's orders...

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.740
We beastmen can't defy Sylvasta's orders.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.430
However, we are free now.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.120
Let's run together!
<i>There's no way I'd do that!</i>

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.360
Stop meddling with my life...!

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.040
You are <i>mine</i>, Déesse Louve!

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.000
Let me go!

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.980
You're coming with me, Déesse Louve!

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.800
I'm not Déesse Louve! <i>I am Nazuna!</i>

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.510
You're seriously gross.

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:18.650
Deésse Louve...
<i>Why...?!</i>

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.690
Stop! I don't wanna date you!

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.120
What's all this?!

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.120
They are drones equipped with the Beast Factor Termination Vaccine.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.100
Alan!

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.500
I'll use these on all surplus rampaging beastmen in Animacity.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.460
You're the one who made them rampage!

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:45.090
What's your objective?!

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.740
Everything is part of a necessary process.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.010
I plan to let the world know about the dreadful Nirvasyl Syndrome...

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.270
...and legitimize the usage of the Beast Factor Termination Vaccine.

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.350
This is a demonstration, so to speak.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.650
Is that why you threw Animacity into a crisis?! Unforgivable!

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:06.780
Calm down! As long as we use the Termination Vaccine to eliminate the Beast Factor, everything's gonna be fine.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.200
That's not a solution! You don't have to erase the Beast Factor. A serum is just enough!

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.030
Serum?

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.450
My blood and Nazuna's can be turned into a cure!

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:18.370
If we complete the serum, there'll be no need to turn beastmen into humans!

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.580
That's... I wasn't able to predict that.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.050
I started rampaging, but I went back to normal!

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.320
So don't use the Termination Vaccine!

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.130
I see. I get what you mean now.

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.550
Leave the rest to me.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:40.370
Stop it!

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.570
Ahh... There's no other way.

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:51.530
Shirou!

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.010
Make it stop...!

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.330
I thought you were smarter than this.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.150
Isn't it amazing? Their precious Ginrou was actually a human...

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:11.600
...and after finding out, those poor beastmen went insane and started rampaging, only to be turned into humans themselves...

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:13.550
That's horrible...!

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.650
Are you going to bite me? So scary~

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.290
Damn it...

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.300
Don't get in my way again, please.

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:55.720
I won't let a filthy human like you... destroy beastmen!

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.810
Would you get those dirty paws off me?

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:01.810
What...?!

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.110
I'll teach you the truth about the world!

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:11.990
A beastman...?!

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.070
His smell is completely human...!

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:20.490
The Sylvasta Family has been living among humans and controlling them for generations.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.750
Things like hiding your beastman side are easy.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:29.920
Unlike you hybrid beasts, we purebreds are the real beastmen.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.670
Take a look at a true godly wolf.

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:44.350
Originally, beastmen worshipped the local beasts as gods...

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.230
...and used their power for their own gain.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:51.320
By refusing to mix with beasts of another nature, they kept their own blood pure.

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:53.850
That's what a purebred is.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.570
Most beastmen hated being in contact with humans...

00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:01.160
...so they let go of their original land and created a separate one with other beastmen.

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:04.750
Just like you and other beastmen living in this city.

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:12.880
Pride-born beastmen were the only ones who refused to mix with other blood and protected their pride.

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:17.300
This form is proof of those proud purebreds.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.640
To think a hybrid like you calls himself a " protector"...

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.930
Your ignorance... is frightening!

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:28.190
You talk a lot for someone with three necks!

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:33.160
You're immortal too?!

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.750
Immortality is our exclusive right.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.860
An undead ritual that can only be performed by the chosen...

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:43.040
...where you gather blood from a thousand wolf beastmen and pour it into your body.

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:45.750
Doing that grants you this power.

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:48.780
It seems you've happened to meet the same fate.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:53.200
But you're the result of mixed blood, so after all, you're no more than a sham.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.840
A sham...?!

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:57.220
Hybrids aren't even beastmen, anyways.

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:01.650
Things like the Nirvasyl Syndrome happen only because you're a hybrid.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.430
The mixture of Beast Factors leads to the stress that causes rampages.

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.710
We purebreds don't have such an issue.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:13.230
We will also keep ruling the world as purebreds, like always.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.440
Controlling humans from the shadows, that is.

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:18.900
<i>That's the truth about the world!</i>

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.320
That's what you get for getting in my way.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:46.640
Stop!

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:15.750
You're persistent!

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.220
<i>Déesse Louve...</i>

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:27.720
I'll turn a profit if I help you! So be grateful!

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:28.930
You're...

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:32.100
<i>A mangoose...!</i>
A <i>mink!</i> Mari the Mink!

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.400
<i>May you be a good beastman!</i>

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:44.410
Ginrou-sama! This way, come on!

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:45.830
My money!

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:47.740
I'm not Ginrou!

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.540
You gave us a Super Crust.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:55.580
To us, anyone who feeds us when we're hungry is considered a god.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.300
I ran in a dangerous direction!

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.310
This way!

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:02.580
We're surrounded!

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:05.930
If I knew running to save people would be like this...!

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:18.570
Are you alright?
Pinga!

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:22.400
Stop that thing! It has a drug that turns beastmen into humans!

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:23.200
What?!

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:26.630
Nazuna!

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.120
Pinga, take care of that drone!
<i>Leave it to me!</i>

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.050
Michiru?

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:48.780
Michiru!
<i>Nazuna!</i>

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.600
Eh? W-what's going on?

00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:01.780
I don't know, but beastmen seem to react instinctively to this howling.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:11.370
Those drones only seem to target rampaging beastmen.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:15.410
If only there was a way to make this howl reach all of Animacity...

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.460
<i>The live event!</i>

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:23.600
Jackie, you and your friends should turn on as many TVs as you can in the city.

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:27.300
Me, Nazuna and Mari will go to the venue center and broadcast a video!

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:33.950
These guys are annoying.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:38.520
Where were you hiding all this?!
Illegal gun trafficking must have a limit, too!

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:44.110
Enemy invasion! Enemy invasion!
If you get hit by the enemy, you'll turn into a human!

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.680
So the bear goes after the honey?

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.550
I hope you appreciate me being a criminal!

00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:57.710
Go, go.

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:09.890
That's it!

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:14.060
Mari, hurry up!
<i>Be patient! This ain't easy.</i>

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:20.670
Stop your useless struggling.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:21.610
Alan...!

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:26.150
I don't know what you're scheming, but take a good look.

00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:28.310
Animacity is over.

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.300
Beastmen will kill each other before that serum is completed...

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:36.950
The city will be destroyed, and all those remaining will be turned into humans by the Termination Vaccine!

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:45.090
A woman bearing those arms isn't very pretty.

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:50.720
You're a human, so wouldn't it be better for you to just go back to normal and live your life normally?

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:57.180
Being a girl, a beastman, a human...
I don't give a damn about any of that!

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:03.810
I'll decide what's normal for me... And how I live, and if I'm pretty or not as well!

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:07.860
If there are beastmen who want to turn into humans, then so be it!

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:11.660
But the way you stripped them from the right to decide that...

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:14.350
It's really... Awfully...

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:15.960
<b>GROSS!</b>

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:21.500
That's a real shame!

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:25.880
Good bye, <b>you disgusting hybrid!</b>

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:34.590
Shirou!

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:38.210
To think you were still alive...

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:41.310
The people living inside me...

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:44.000
...they're telling me not to give up.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:47.320
Those people you scoffed at for being hybrids!

00:15:57.950 --> 00:15:58.700
Alan...

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:00.790
He was a beastman all along...?

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.630
Are you trying to buy some time?

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.340
That's right...!

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.050
Until I learn your tricks, that is!

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:24.750
There's no way...

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:27.150
a filthy hybrid like you...

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:30.440
...can match...

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:32.530
...my divine howl!

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.130
What?!

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:52.550
Incredible...!

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.550
I haven't lived a thousand years for nothing!

00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:59.600
That's... impossible...!

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.200
This isn't a "divine howl" or <i>anything</i> like that!

00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:17.720
It just serves to kill people!

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.100
Do you want to taste it again?!

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:24.410
Let me go...! Stop it... Please stop... Sto...!

00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:28.000
That's...!

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.940
...the Nirvasyl Syndrome!

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:34.900
T... that can't be...!

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.900
You're in shambles.

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:39.900
What was that about "not being affected"?

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:44.100
<b>I'll finish you before your reason fades away!</b>

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:47.000
<i>Someone help me! Please!</i>

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:09.500
Her antibodies run through my blood.

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:22.530
Why... did you save me...?

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:25.330
I don't want to live with regrets anymore.

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.960
Michiru! All ready.

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.110
Give me that video.

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:40.550
No way! I have no battery?!

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:43.530
Seriously?! We have to charge it up!

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:46.830
Shirou!

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:48.750
Please! Can you howl?

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.840
The only one who can protect Animacity... is Ginrou!

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:02.050
The real one is amazing!

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:22.660
<i>This is when I realized.</i>

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.760
<i>Me and Nazuna are different from them.</i>

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:30.750
<i>...but seeing Shirou so sad, so miserable...</i>

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:34.590
<i>...but still thinking about others...</i>

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:48.560
<i>It took some time, but the rampaging beastmen went back to normal.</i>

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:54.300
Get your limited 5 photo set of the new Animacity symbol, Nazuna!

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:58.940
<i>A video recorded from a hidden camera that caught Nazuna saving a kid buzzed around...</i>

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:02.360
<i>...and she became popular among beastmen and humans.</i>

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:05.450
<i>She says she didn't know there was a camera...</i>

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:07.430
<i>...but I think she definitely knew.</i>

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:11.330
<i>She's very calculating.</i>

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:15.980
We protected our autonomy.

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:20.380
After negotiating with the Prime Minister and the Sylvasta Conglomerate...

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:22.400
...they reluctantly accepted.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:29.690
Alan resigned as the President of Sylvasta Pharmaceutics, so it's safe to assume he's going to lay low for now.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.430
I will change this city.

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:36.190
To make them understand what we are.

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:38.700
I will invite humans to the city as well.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:42.240
And I'll have beastmen learn about humans, too.

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.070
Can you do such a thing?

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.390
It will be difficult.

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:48.930
But I'll take it slow.

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:51.430
Thankfully, I have time.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.310
We both do.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.000
Shirou!

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:02.900
Is your body okay now?

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:04.220
Yeah!

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:11.970
See?

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:13.980
Sorry for everything.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.000
It's not your fault.

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:19.600
The cure for your beastman disease is near, too.

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:21.270
That's good.

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.000
You'll be able to go home.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.510
I'm fine like this.

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:28.970
I'll stay here for now.

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:34.660
Only Nazuna and I have experience being both beastman and human.

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:38.700
I think there are things here that I can only accomplish the way I am right now.

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:43.880
Besides, I like the current me.

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:48.800
What will you do in this city?

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:51.490
I can't say for sure yet, but...

00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:53.950
...I'll look for things only I can do.

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:56.730
Like playing basketball, and helping Nazuna out.

00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:59.480
Of course, I'll help you out, too.

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.050
I don't remember asking you, though.

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:09.990
Say, the night I first got here, I saw Ginrou.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.790
You were really happy about that festival, weren't you?

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:18.000
That's why you wanted to celebrate as Ginrou.

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:22.920
But wouldn't it be better to be in whatever form you want to be on from now on?

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:24.500
<i>Michiru!</i>

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:26.550
Let's go get some tea!

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:28.170
Okay!

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:29.930
I'll get going, then.

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:38.480
We might be able to change...

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:43.610
...this city, too.
