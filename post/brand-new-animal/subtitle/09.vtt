00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.890
～♪

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.350
Why don't you stop this "guru" thing?

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.400
You're not Ginrou.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.860
You have no need to keep the lie up like that.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.320
Because the real Ginrou is out there.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.070
So what?

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.570
I'm the Silver Wolf Maiden, "Déesse Louve".

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.290
The order's "fanclub" is close to surpassing 5,000 members.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.920
Their lives are full of sorrow, but just by looking at me, they feel a little better.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.090
Déesse Louve serves as a ray of hope for those people.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.180
I mean, Michiru, why did you come here to tell me that?

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.850
Did you come to accuse me of being a fake?

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.770
No! I just...

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.810
Oh, you're "worried about me"?

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.560
And there's that "justice" of yours rearing its head!

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.020
I've made up my mind a long time ago.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.820
Staying up late is bad for the skin, so hurry up and leave.

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.880
Shirou. How are your wounds?

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.630
You came here to talk, right?

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.170
Yeah...

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.090
No one knows about your secret, so don't worry.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.190
When you're hungry, it's easy to feel down.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.440
You have to see things, feel things for yourself...

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.440
...and find an asnwer that convinces you.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.320
What?
<i>It's nothing.</i>

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.490
I was thinking how a thousand-year-old person is so different...

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.490
Are you making fun of me?
<i>Hehe~</i>

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.490
Thanks.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:47.950
I'm digging in.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.810
I'm about to go to the police to look into Yaba. What about you?

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.270
I'm good today. I have something planned.

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.850
Don't go near the cult. Or the Medical Center. Got it?

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.440
I know, I know. See you later!

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.190
The slums!

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.480
It should've ended up around here...

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.450
Michiru!

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.870
Whatcha up to?
<i>I should be the one asking that.</i>

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.910
What's all this?

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.870
Mineral-ish Water!

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.000
Using the water purifier I bought recently...

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.500
You're still using that?

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.510
I do this and... here!

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.890
Done! That's Mineral-ish Water!

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.770
Aaahhh! Trash-free water is amazing!

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:34.190
Wanna take a sip?

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.650
I'll pass.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.860
I sell them for 10 yen each!

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.940
It's great! I'll get rich in no time!

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.580
There it is!

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.000
Oh! That's the Ginrou-sama thing!

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.330
I love the Silver Wolf Maiden!

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.880
I've been changing thanks to Ginrou-sama!

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.340
I don't do things like pulling other people's flowers out...

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.840
...or pull out other people's bicycle saddles and resell them anymore!

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.550
Because Ginrou-sama is watching!

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.810
Everyone in the slums says that.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.770
May you become a good beastman!

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.020
Is that okay, then?

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.940
T-this is Mineral-ish Water!

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.820
-ish! I'm not lying!

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.360
It's business! Business!

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.570
If "good beastmen" hear about this, they'll be disgusted.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.450
Do you also like Ginrou-sama?

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.750
Yeah... I like her.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.630
I found a 10-yen coin!

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.090
I gotta show it to everyone!

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.140
He hasn't changed a bit...

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:59.150
Before Yaba went out of control, there wasn't anything peculiar about him.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.700
That day, Yaba was acting like normal...

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.670
...and Boris, the trainer for the cult came to visit...

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:22.670
Boris?

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:26.050
He said something about "teaching sinners about God".

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:30.720
The jail was completely obliterated, and dangerous criminals broke out.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.220
No matter how many reports I make, it'll never be enough.

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:35.600
I'd like to see Yaba's body.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.100
Ah, it was transported to the Medical Center.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.350
To the Medical Center? The autopsy is a job for the police.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:47.030
Obeying orders from above is also a job for the police.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.830
Nazuna?

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.630
Nazuna!

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:33.450
The Medical Center?

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:54.340
<i>How are the results for that scan going?</i>

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:56.300
<i>Ah, about that...</i>

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:16.870
Nazuna!

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.620
Nazuna! Nazuna!

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:23.750
Nazuna!

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:24.580
Michiru?!

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:29.420
Aaahhh... Are you okay?

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:34.680
<i>What are you doing?!</i>

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.180
Entry is prohibited to unrelated parties!

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.140
Nazuna and I are plenty related!

00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:43.850
Michiru, no!

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:00.080
Don't touch Nazuna!

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:04.580
This damn brute...!

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:12.380
Michiru... That's enough...

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.020
Michiru!

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:34.530
Release her.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:40.700
What do you plan to do with Nazuna?!

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.040
If anything happens to Nazuna...

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.290
The cult will hear about it!

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:47.670
And I... I will...!

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:51.340
That habit of yours of being stubborn and jumping in...

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:53.420
You don't change at all, huh.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:57.880
My apologies.

00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:01.350
I'm sure she mistook this as me being abducted.

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:06.560
It's alright. Wanting to save your friend and acting recklessly because of that...

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.730
I can't say I disapprove.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.900
Nazuna, you've got quite the friend.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:16.820
You're Michiru, right? I've heard a lot about you from Nazuna.

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:18.820
I know you.

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:20.620
You're that admirable Sylvasta guy...

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:23.330
Oh, what an honor.

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:26.660
That's right. I am Alan Sylvasta.

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:29.120
I'm the representative of Sylvasta Pharmaceutics.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:33.750
What's going on? Why is Nazuna here?

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.960
I just came to take an MRI scan.

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:38.470
MRI?

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:41.970
She's been undergoing regular check-ups for a while...

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:43.970
...and letting us get some data out of it.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.180
I'm here on my own volition.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.680
Would you go home?

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.770
Well, since this is a peculiar occasion...

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:55.320
...we should let Michiru here into the loop as well.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:00.950
<i>That's...</i>
Leaving her in the dark with half-baked details could cause a lot of trouble for us in the future...

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:04.490
I think Michiru has the right to know.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.410
About how she became a beastman...

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:11.420
Alright.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:12.920
Nazuna?

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:18.170
Michiru, I ought to apologize to you.

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:22.930
The reason behind your beast form... is this Medical Center.

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:33.520
You were both accidentally transfused a Beast Factor reagent extracted from a beastman.

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:46.910
In the drugs Yaiba and Mimura were trafficking...

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.370
The Beast Factor reagent was mixed in by accident.

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:57.670
Those were accidentally administered to both of you.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:59.340
That's...

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:04.930
Yaba noticed the amount of packages didn't line up, so he desperately tried to track it down.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.180
As a result, he found out that Nazuna could transform into a beastman...

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:10.720
...and quickly abducted and isolated her.

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:15.480
But he only noticed you could also transform into a beastman...

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.070
...after you came to the city.

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:24.030
The real reason behind the bombing was so they could erase all data about the mixup.

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:27.530
Because the development of the reagent was top secret.

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:31.250
If it were discovered, no punishment for letting that slip would be enough.

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:33.870
<i>If only you weren't here...!</i>

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:38.790
Are you saying Nazuna and I are victims of your research?

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.380
That's horrible!
<i>My apologies...</i>

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:44.180
We're fully responsible for this.

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:48.140
But it's alright. You can go back to being human.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:54.600
We're developing a cure for the "beastman disease". It will be completed soon.

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:58.860
If you use that, you and Nazuna will be able to go back to normal.

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:03.320
That's why I'm here to help Sylvasta.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:17.170
When I heard I was <i>made</i> into a beastman, I was shocked.

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:20.460
But Sylvasta Pharmaceutics took all responsibility...

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:24.630
...and they promised to make a cure for me to return to normal.

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:28.720
Until the cure is completed, I assigned a job...

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:32.600
...to Nazuna, to instill hope into all beastmen.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.270
By transforming, that is.

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:44.190
Hold on! Didn't you oppose the cult coming to Animacity in the first place?

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:47.280
Yeah. I needed to do that.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:51.240
To decrease beastmen's mental entropy...

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:54.250
...the Silver Wolf Order is needed.

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:56.710
E... Entropy...?

00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:00.420
Haven't you noticed since moving to Animacity?

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.880
Beastmen are easily driven by their emotions.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.720
Their frustration builds up and they explode from little things, disturbing the peace.

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:13.640
To preserve their mental stability, we're using their faith in Ginrou.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:18.770
Facing a "god" makes their mental entropy decrease.

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:21.020
Is that different from stress?

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:27.700
However, being invited by religions created by the very humans who oppress beastmen... They won't believe in that.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.110
What about that?

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:32.120
You were targeted but Nazuna saved you, didn't she?

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:36.660
I had prior information that indicated I might be targeted.

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:38.830
I just used that to my advantage.

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:43.040
We must put up a show in order for people to believe, after all.

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:46.090
Having beastmen choose to believe on their own...

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:49.550
...would lead to their mental entropy quickly decreasing.

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:51.470
So it's stress...

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:54.970
Mental entropy... Do you understand?

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:00.230
You were fooling everyone?

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:03.190
It was a show!

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:06.190
It's resulting in a more orderly Animacity.

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:08.610
It would've been nice to know all this.

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:11.660
I told you I'm looking for a way to cure this disease, didn't I?

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:14.410
You know it's top-secret.

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:19.290
Only Boris and I know about this... There's no way we could've told an outsider like you, Michiru.

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:22.210
The ones with this illness are you and me, Nazuna!

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.630
Wouldn't that make that gross geezer an outsider?

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:26.920
I told you he's not gross.

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:30.670
He's around you 24/7, of course he's gross!

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:32.800
Well, calm down.

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:35.680
You're judging people based on appearances.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.390
That applies to both of you.

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:41.020
You saw Nazuna getting pulled into my car...

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:42.650
...and assumed she was being abducted.

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:45.650
But the truth was different, wasn't it?

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:49.900
The truth lies in that which you cannot see.

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:54.620
I'm taking responsibility and developing a cure.

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:59.790
You can both return to your human selves. I promise.

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:03.580
Until then, would you help Nazuna out?

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:15.430
"Help"? What can <i>I</i> do?

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:18.680
He means not to interfere in our business.

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:22.390
"our"...

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:54.610
I told you not to approach the cult or the Medical Center.

00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:58.360
They said I can go back to being human.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.580
So it was a medical error?
<i>Yeah.</i>

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:08.370
But he apologized a lot...

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.290
...and he promised to develop a cure.

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.210
Do you trust that?

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:16.510
He's using you for his own benefit.

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:20.550
You think that just because Alan is human, right?

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.760
You distrust anything a human says, after all.

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:26.140
Your friend is a human too, right?

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:29.350
She pretends she's Ginrou and tries to fool beastmen.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.980
That's how humans are.

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.940
That's not true! Nazuna isn't like that.

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:38.320
She's lying about being Ginrou...

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:41.910
...but she always said she wanted to be an idol.

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:46.370
She wants to become an idol and have people fawn over her.

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.870
Well, there have been situations like that, but...

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:56.800
...she really wants oppressed and sorrowful beastmen to have some hopes and dreams.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.720
That's why she works so hard as Ginrou.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.390
I think that's amazing.

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:06.640
So I want you to overlook the fact that she's pretending to be Ginrou.

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.020
Did you enter their cult?

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:14.770
Ah, no way. I can't believe in a counterfeit religion.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:16.980
But I believe in Nazuna.

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:22.200
I think she noticed that feeling hasn't wavered at all, after all this time.

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:26.870
Though the person in question won't ever say it out loud.

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:29.960
Do you want to be a human again?

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.920
Yeah, I want to.

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:36.880
Once you go back, are you leaving Animacity?

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.920
I came to love this city...

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:42.840
...but I do want to go back home.

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:46.850
I see.
<i>Yeah.</i>

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:53.440
<i>Leave it open.</i>

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:57.190
The wind is cold tonight. You will catch a cold.

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:58.690
It's fine.

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:00.280
That tanuki girl...

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.160
...will she finally stop coming?

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:06.200
Boris.
<i>Yes.</i>

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:09.950
From now on, I'll leave my management to someone else.

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:11.330
Eh...! Why is that?

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:13.750
Because you're gross.
<i>G... Gro...</i>

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:17.540
Also, entering my room without permission...

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:19.400
...that's gross, so stop doing it.

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:22.170
May you become a good beastman.

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:27.140
May... you become a good beastman.

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:38.190
She's a human, after all...

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:40.610
Did you say someting?
<i>No.</i>

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:44.200
What will it be today?
<i>I want to know the results from Yaba's autopsy.</i>

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.070
Why did he turn out like that?

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:48.910
I saw a change in his Beast Factor.

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:50.080
Beast Factor?

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.750
I don't know the details yet, but...

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:55.500
Once I know, I'll have a report made.

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:57.290
Why in the Medical Center...

00:20:57.830 --> 00:21:01.550
It's frustrating, but the Medical Center has cutting edge technology.

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:05.260
Aside from that, Alan isn't as bad of a human as you think he is.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.600
So everyone's siding with him now?

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:12.470
I haven't met a single good human in my entire life.

00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:15.390
What? You're always meeting someone like that.

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.490
Isn't Michiru a good human?

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:27.070
Thank you for making time in your tight schedule.

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.070
What's the urgent business?

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:33.910
Animacity wouldn't have been established had it not been for your efforts.

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:35.500
Prime Minister Shiramizu.

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:38.330
That's why I have some advice.

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:39.500
Advice?

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:43.460
I have something I want to lend to the Japanese government.
