00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.550
I am human... I <i>was</i> human!

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.700
You look like a tanuki.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.790
I-I'm not! I'm a raccoon!

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.040
If you were a raccoon, you'd have stripes on your tail. You're a tanuki no matter what.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:16.090
I don't like tanukis!

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:20.260
Follow me.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.480
He got here first, huh...

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.990
♪～

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.870
～♪

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.170
Hold on!

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.090
Where are you taking m--

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.930
Ah, uh, I-I mean...

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.310
How long do you plan on staying that way?

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.430
Hurry up and change back to a human.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.770
That's...

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.390
You can't?

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.230
<i>I thought he was older...</i>

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.660
Huh?

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.700
What's wrong?

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.870
No one's in their beast forms...

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.290
That's a given.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.750
I mean, just a bit ago...

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.710
That's because that was a festival. This is normal.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.310
Whaaaaat? Are you kidding?

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.180
What do you mean?

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.470
I thought everyone used their beast form all the time...

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.800
Don't say something so human-like.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.470
Well, I <i>am</i> a human.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:42.860
We're here.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.780
Yep, she's a beastman.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.490
What? Just with that?

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.080
A beastmen marker is a simple but effective way of examination.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.250
You're without a doubt a beastman.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.500
That's not true! I'm a human!

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.430
Even without using a marker, you can clearly tell you're a beastman, though...

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.970
I'm really a human!

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.600
I was a normal human a year ago...

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.140
Then I became like this out of nowhere...

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:19.690
That's not possible.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.110
Humans are humans. Beastmen are beastmen.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.440
It's decided from the beginning. It doesn't change like that.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.800
I'm sure it's a disease or something!

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.350
A disease?

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.030
Yeah! A disease! A beastman disease!

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.530
There must be people like that in this town, right?

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.950
There's no one like that.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.170
Well, I've never heard of a case like that.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.760
Lately, it seems there have been strange diseases regarding human delusions...

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.220
...so I recommend getting check--

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.270
Not <i>that</i> kind of disease!

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.060
Gem, don't say it like that!

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.440
I swear you have no delicacy at all...

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.560
I'm really sorry. You're Ms. Kagemori, right?

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.690
Ah, yes! I'm Michiru Kagemori.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.030
I'm Melissa.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.990
You see Gem like this, but he's the Director for the Beastmen Life Association.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.040
It's also our job to help newcomers with their troubles.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.120
In any case, you'll go to the council tomorrow for your Beast Registration...

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.250
...so make sure to fill this in, yeah?

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.850
I-I'm telling you, I'm really not a beastman! A Beast Registration...

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.090
Even so...

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.930
That's it! My student credential!

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.430
Student credential?

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.770
My blood type and species are written in my student credential.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.310
Beastmen and humans have different blood types...

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.520
...it's clearly written so there are no mistakes when transfusing blood, so...

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.490
Right... It was in my wallet...

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.660
Oh bother... You'd better give up on that.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:58.740
No waaaay!

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.500
If something gets taken from you in Animacity, the chances of getting it back are slim.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.710
How about you go sleep? You look very tired...

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.930
In any case, this'll have to be enough for today.

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.260
The bed is clean, so...

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.970
It's enough! I've always been homeless, so it's fine.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.810
If there's anything you don't get, ask Shirou over here.

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.730
Whoa! Ouch...

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:31.940
Kuro...

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.120
We're getting up early tomorrow. Get some rest.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.500
Shirou isn't too sociable, but he's not a bad guy.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.460
Oh, he's named Shirou...

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.960
Oh, you haven't asked him?

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.460
Shirou Oogami, he's our social worker.

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.840
Shirou will take you to the council tomorrow.

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.140
Oogami...

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.160
We don't have a bathtub, but you can use the shower, right?

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:04.350
Oh, yeah!

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.070
This is <i>not</i> what I thought would happen...

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:26.870
It's packed...

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.120
See ya.

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.630
Eh? you're leaving?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.590
I also have some things to attend to. I just took the chance to take you here.

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:34.840
Do the rest yourself.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.300
<i>Move!</i>

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:38.760
I'm in a hurry.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.220
I come first!

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.930
What? Are you kidding me?!

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:48.640
What? What's going on?

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.190
Younglings like to show off their power.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.480
No no no, that's not what I mean...

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:56.610
Are there no rules?
<i>There are.</i>

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:07.910
The stronger one wins. It's a simple rule.

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:11.250
T-there's no way...

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.000
Your turn won't come up if you just stand there.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:20.550
Sigh... I didn't think it this city would be like this...

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.970
I feel I've seen him around...

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.440
Oh, could he be...?

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:35.320
Thank you for capturing the bomber.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:40.240
They were terrorists hired by an anti-beastman organization.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.570
If money is involved, even our fellow beastmen would accept such a job.

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:44.780
It's sad.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.370
Those guys are a disgrace to beastmen.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:53.210
By the way, I have one more request.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:00.470
I knew it!

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:06.560
What are you doing?!

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.220
Give me back my wallet!

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.680
Iunno what yer talkin' about!

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.640
There's no way you don't know!

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:13.480
You stole it from me yesterday!

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.940
Ya think I remember that far back?!

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:16.980
Far back?! It was yesterday!

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:20.110
In this town, it's pointless even if you're talking about yesterday.

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:24.490
Uh... Where have I...

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:28.950
Ah, you're that weasel--
<i>Mink!</i>

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:32.080
Not a weasel, but Mari the Mink!

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.750
Tanukis really are half-witted, huh?

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.380
See ya never!

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.920
So you <i>were</i> an accomplice!

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:45.260
You just "happened" to see me? You're an accomplice so you came to help him, right?

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:49.890
It was just a coincidence, a <i>coincidence</i>... It's because this city is so small!

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.060
Gimme some credit.

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:56.480
Who do you have to thank for making it into this city?

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:58.820
I paid you properly, didn't I?!

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:00.360
Okay, okay...

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:03.570
Trust is the priority in this business, after all.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.110
I'll tell you as a service.

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:08.080
For lost things, Rabbit Town is the place.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.950
Everyone gathers around there.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.580
Rabbit Town?

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:16.040
Yeah. Pay a visit to Gran Grandma over there.

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.470
This feels nothing like a "rabbit" town...

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:27.930
Huh? What's up with ya?

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:29.470
E-excuse me...

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.180
Do you happen to know where Gran Grandma could be located?

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:45.360
You got some guts showing up in your beast form here.

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:48.160
Don't play dumb.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.410
In gang terms, changing to your beast form means you wanna fight.

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:55.370
<i>Showing up</i> in beast form means you're looking for a fight, ain't that right?!

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:56.750
Y-y-you misunderstand!

00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:01.170
I can't control it myself, so I can't go back from this form!

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:03.340
You can't go back?

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:06.630
You're not a baby! Are you mocking me?

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:10.220
I'm not mocking anyone! I really can't!

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:12.140
I was a human up until last year...

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.560
So you were...

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:19.480
Did you think such a poor excuse would fly?

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:21.150
I can prove it!

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:24.280
There's a student credential in the wallet that was stolen from me yesterday...

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.950
I came here to look for that!

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.910
Why do you think it's here?

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.780
I heard it from a weas... from Ms. Itami.

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:33.410
She said you might know...

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:36.250
Huh, so it was Mari...

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:39.380
Ah, that's it! That's my wallet!

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.960
Look at the student credential inside and you'll see! I'm actually...

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:43.550
You're a student?

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:46.880
She asked if you're a student!

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:48.550
T-that's right...

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:50.550
So that means...

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.810
You can at least read and write, right?

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:55.270
I can...

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.140
I don't mind giving this back, but...

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:01.980
In exchange, can I ask you for a favor?

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:06.400
Teach these kids to read and write.

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:08.740
There were children here...?

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.820
Betrayed by men...

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:13.780
People like me... Washed up people...

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:15.870
They all end up in Rabbit Town.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.710
Beastwomen who have nowhere else to go...

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:23.090
...more or less have to choose the dangerous path.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:28.550
These kids must also strongly feel that bitterness.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.590
If they can read and write...

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.890
...they can open up the path for a better tomorrow.

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:36.810
If you do that for me, I'll return your wallet.

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:37.850
Got it.

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:39.810
I will do it!

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.020
Can anyone read this?

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:46.980
Is there?

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:51.160
Yes! You!

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:52.450
Poop!

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:55.910
Okay. That's somewhat wrong.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.330
This is "Mi", "Chi", "Ru"!

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:02.250
It reads Michiru! That's my name.

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:06.340
Okay, can anyone write their own name?

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.340
What's your name?

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:10.380
Youta.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.970
Youta, I see.

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:18.850
This is "Youta".

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.730
"Yo", "U", "Ta".

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:21.810
Try writing it!

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:32.860
That's right! That's "Youta". It's your name.

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:39.290
Who else wants to write their name?

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:14.200
This place reeks of women like always.

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:26.170
Alright, let's first memorize all hiragana, okay?

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:27.420
Hey, are you listening?

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:32.090
Wow, you're good at that! Is that a wolf?

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:34.880
No, it's Ginrou-sama.

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:36.010
Ginrou-sama?

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:40.180
That's bad, Michiru. You don't even know Ginrou-sama?

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:41.720
Nope, I don't know.

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:44.440
It's the God of Beastmen!

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:47.520
When a beastman is really having a hard time...

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:49.690
A silver wolf will come to the rescue!

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.650
The story's been around since forever.

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:57.410
Was that it, then...?

00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:59.200
Michiru, did you see it?

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:00.530
No way! Really?!

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.540
N-no, I didn't get a good look at...

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.250
Huh?

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:11.420
Hey, Kusakabe. What are you doing here?

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.710
For business, obviously!

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.550
Who would come here if it ain't for work?

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.180
Sure, "work"...

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:19.800
You came for the money anyway, right?

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:23.270
Didn't I tell you the money isn't here yet?

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.390
"It's not here~"

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:26.850
...yeah, right!

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:29.190
If ya don't have it, then make it!

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:30.610
You women...

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:35.030
Who do ya have to thank for being able to live in the Yakuza business? Think about it real hard!

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:37.450
...What did you say?!
<i>You wanna go?!</i>

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:41.160
Don't be childish, Kusakabe.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.620
B-Boss...

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:47.410
I don't wanna fight with my woman colleagues.

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:50.580
It's just a matter of paying up.

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:55.590
Showing your face around here is a rare sight for sure, Flip.

00:14:55.970 --> 00:15:00.590
I thought I'd pay a visit to the fabled Gran Grandma once in a while.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.890
Sure you did.

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:06.850
Even if you come out, I can't pay what I can't pay.

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:08.940
Is that so?

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:11.810
I heard you stocked up on some new animals.

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.150
If you prepare those...

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.280
...the money will start coming in.

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.820
Why do you know that?

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.530
Did you think you could hide it?

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:24.540
Well, it seems the higher-ups have also caught wind of it.

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.250
What?

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:28.790
After all, women's work...

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:30.750
...is pretty obvious.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:36.130
If you don't prepare them before packing them up, they won't even amount to a thousand yen.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:37.460
You got that, didn't you?

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.720
You're able to keep yer business thanks to <i>us!</i>

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:49.520
What's going on? What are you planning to do with us?

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:52.730
Thought I'd bring you all on a trip.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:56.110
It can't be... You're gonna sell us?!

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:58.860
Would've been nice if they managed to read some more...

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:00.610
...so they could sell even higher.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:04.370
Turns out I had to dispatch them all now.

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:06.830
So that's why you asked me to...

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:09.370
They're your children! Are you for real?!

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:13.330
I don't recall saying they were my children.

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:16.300
Then, these kids...

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.630
They're children wo got lost...

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:21.550
...or whose parents died when they got to Animacity.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.800
Are you... are you serious...?

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:27.560
That's horrible!

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:32.270
Weaklings step on those weaker than them to live on.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.400
That's the kind of place this is.

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:40.190
Ginrou-sama, save us...!

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:44.450
Asking a god for help won't solve anything. We have to fend off for ourselves!

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:49.660
Everyone, hold on!

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:09.140
What an undisciplined tanuki.

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:11.770
Roll up the cable!

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:21.860
This is it, huh.
<i>No way!</i>

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.570
Look, the driver's seat is closer now!

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:27.530
We mustn't give up!

00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:31.250
No one will help us because we're in this city!

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:34.500
We must extend our own hands...

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:39.750
...and grab onto each other...!

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:43.470
No matter how hard you try, you can't close that distance!

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:54.140
My... my arms are extending!

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:57.520
Nngh...! Oh! I think I grabbed onto something!

00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:59.650
Aah! My hands are stretched out! Gross.

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:02.610
That's amazing!
<i>But your hands are gross.</i>

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:05.110
That "gross" was uncalled for! Ah, but I think...

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.910
I grabbed onto some sort of lever!

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.030
Come on...!

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.410
Pull on the lever...!

00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:13.830
What... what's going on?!

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:15.160
What a mess!

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:18.380
Come on, pull!

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:32.470
Alright, everyone, run!

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:35.640
Hold it!

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:39.150
What an interesting skill you have.

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:41.570
You're really not a beastman, are you?

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:42.980
Run!

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:46.400
Ngh... Let go...!

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:47.740
Make it quick.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.200
Got it.

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:02.840
...the hell are you?!

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:08.680
Ginrou...

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:13.310
There is no forgiveness for those who sell beastmen to humans,

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.270
...even if it's a woman.

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:17.680
Don't say that!

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:29.570
I surrender. Be gentle with older people.

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:43.210
Looks like another success, Oogami.

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:45.750
We'd be in serious trouble if you didn't...

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:48.340
...manage to catch the tail of that beast gang.

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:50.720
It was a request from the mayor.

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:52.430
Where are the kids?

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:55.850
Who's that?

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:59.100
She's a newcomer. We're tending to her in the association.

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:03.310
You got a rough welcome as soon as you got here, huh.

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:06.900
We'll be protecting the kids, so you don't need to worry.

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:10.700
We have an institution for orphans, after all.

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:18.830
What is it?

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:22.210
Unforgivable! Trying to sell children...

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:27.630
Even if you're a beastman, don't you have a human heart?!

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:30.760
Heh, I see.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:34.090
It really seems like you're not a beastman.

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:36.180
What do you mean?

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:39.770
Living as a woman in the world of beastmen...

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:42.390
Tell me that once you're know how rough it is.

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.990
Why were you there?

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:56.990
You saw it all from that building above, didn't you?

00:20:57.450 --> 00:20:58.290
Yeah.

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.790
Why didn't you come to help back then?

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:04.250
You knew we were gonna be sold, didn't you?!

00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:06.460
There was no evidence yet.

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:09.210
The only way to arrest them was to catch them in the act.

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:11.970
What would you do if you didn't make it in time?

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:13.800
What would you do if the boat sailed?

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:16.350
We could've been sold!

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:18.970
Did you even think about those children?

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:21.100
I never miss.

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:23.890
I will protect every beastwoman and child.

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:26.150
Woman and child...

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:30.150
Are guys really all that? Are men really all that?

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:33.650
Look at that! I'm a human!

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:38.080
"I never miss", yeah right...

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:41.040
Do you see your mistake?

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.710
I hate beastmen and this damned city!

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:47.380
I'll heal from this damn disease and get the hell away from this city!

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:56.340
