00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:21.623
Damn it, it's no use!

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:23.416
What are you doing?

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.545
Uhm, I was trying to go back to my human form...

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.381
You're a weird kid.

00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:34.511
Ah, more importantly, you have a call from the council.

00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:35.845
A call?

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:42.852
It's your beastman registration credential and your insurance card.

00:01:43.228 --> 00:01:45.355
Formalities were still in order, so...

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.899
Consider it as a thank you for the bomb incident.

00:01:48.024 --> 00:01:49.818
It's been a bit rough for you, right?

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:51.319
Thank you.

00:01:51.736 --> 00:01:54.280
With this, you're now officially part of Animacity.

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:56.866
Welcome to the Beastmen Capital.

00:01:56.991 --> 00:01:59.661
Ah, yeah.

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:00.745
Ah, right!

00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:02.705
I'm giving this back.

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:05.166
Don't worry, you can keep it.

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:07.335
...But I can't use it.

00:02:07.752 --> 00:02:11.256
It doesn't connect to the outside internet, does it?

00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:14.300
No matter how many times I tried, only the council site came up.

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:21.057
That's correct. Information on human society is restricted by the Special Beastman Territory Law.

00:02:21.182 --> 00:02:22.183
That's unfair!

00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:26.146
Ms. Michiru, this is a good chance, so please remember this.

00:02:29.357 --> 00:02:33.820
Beastmen, or rather, the Beastman species is different from the Homo Sapiens species.

00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:36.239
Thanks to a special gene called "Beast Factor"...

00:02:36.364 --> 00:02:39.325
...we can freely change our bodies.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.329
In ancient times, beastmen were worshipped by their tribes...

00:02:43.454 --> 00:02:45.874
...and made them look like beast gods.

00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:48.960
They wanted to be like gods.

00:02:50.253 --> 00:02:53.756
That's why your beast form is decided based on ancestry.

00:02:53.882 --> 00:02:55.300
A lion's child will be a lion.

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:59.762
If two species breed, only one of the parents' attributes will prevail.

00:02:59.888 --> 00:03:03.057
The resulting child will be either a lion or a tiger.

00:03:03.182 --> 00:03:05.518
It won't be a liger.

00:03:05.977 --> 00:03:10.982
Of course, humans without a beast factor can't change into a beastman.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.443
But I...

00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:18.156
That's right. The impossible happened to you.

00:03:20.825 --> 00:03:26.289
Beastmen have always lived having no contact with the Homo Sapiens... Humans.

00:03:26.414 --> 00:03:29.500
Be it a forest or a mountain, a deserted island, a desert...

00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:35.465
But due to human environmental development, we had to show ourselves to them whether we wanted to or not.

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:43.890
Since the discovery of the beastman species, there were a couple of conflicts, but we somehow managed to establish Animacity.

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:45.808
But that's when you came in.

00:03:47.143 --> 00:03:49.395
I researched your genes.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.648
They are different from a regular beast factor.

00:03:52.106 --> 00:03:57.779
It's unstable, but an explosion-like cell division occurs when you change shapes.

00:03:57.904 --> 00:04:01.658
That's probably the reason behind your ability to freely change your form.

00:04:01.783 --> 00:04:03.618
It's still just a hypothesis, though.

00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:04.827
Is it curable?

00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:06.412
I don't know that yet.

00:04:07.163 --> 00:04:09.123
Give me some more time.

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:12.293
In any case, please stay with the association.

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:13.378
Okay...

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.300
I kinda get it, but I also don't...

00:04:19.716 --> 00:04:22.804
...though I can't use this, that's for sure.

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:24.722
Heya, tanuki girl!

00:04:24.847 --> 00:04:27.392
Ah, it's the weasel...
<i>I said I'm a mink.</i>

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:30.478
Anyway, I got my hands on some real good stuff! Wanna see?

00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:32.522
No, thank you.

00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:34.524
What?

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:40.905
Illegal phones that can jump over the Animacity firewall...

<i>Eight... Seven...</i>

00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:54.294
Not my tab, but Shirou's!

00:05:00.925 --> 00:05:04.554
My daughter got mad at me recently so I bought an e-cig...

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:06.264
...but that's useless.

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:07.432

…I don't know who distributed the Medical center supplies...!

00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:15.648
You were seen by Shirou Oogami.

Hey, Kusakabe.

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:23.823
How do we deal with men who can't even take responsibility for their own mistakes?

00:05:31.622 --> 00:05:34.208
Flip. I have business with that man.

00:05:37.211 --> 00:05:38.171
You'll have to wait.

00:05:39.088 --> 00:05:42.008
We're not done here yet.

00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:52.018
Stop it!

00:05:54.896 --> 00:05:56.314
Aah, stop i--!

00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:08.117
It seems your business is gone.

00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:34.519
Hey guys!

00:06:34.644 --> 00:06:38.272
Having to go out in a hurry is rough, eh?

00:06:38.397 --> 00:06:41.734
For that occasion, I'll be recommending some cosmetics!

00:06:41.859 --> 00:06:45.363
Even if you're out of time, you'll look like you put a lot of effort into it!

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:53.579
Humans are living here?

00:07:16.477 --> 00:07:17.770
Hey, you bastard.

00:07:18.187 --> 00:07:20.731
Who ordered you to get close to the lady?

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:23.734
Uh... Who's the lady?

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:26.320
I mean...

00:07:27.363 --> 00:07:29.198
Where am I?

00:07:30.783 --> 00:07:32.326
Don't play dumb.

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:37.540
You knew she was The Family's daughter so you closed in on her, didn't you?

00:07:37.665 --> 00:07:40.126
The Family?

00:07:41.878 --> 00:07:43.129
Do you mean...

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:44.964
...that one gang?

00:07:45.089 --> 00:07:46.757
Seems you've remembered something.

00:07:46.883 --> 00:07:47.967
Spit it out.

00:07:48.092 --> 00:07:50.344
What do you want getting close to the lady?!

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.514

<i>Facelook?</i>

00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:57.185

I happened to come over here just recently...

00:08:01.355 --> 00:08:03.024
You come from the mainland?

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:05.610
No way! That's awesome!!

00:08:07.069 --> 00:08:10.990
Really? Where? Tokyo? Shibuya? Harajuku? Omote-sando?

00:08:11.115 --> 00:08:12.742

Mi... Michiru.

00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:19.749
So you were a beastman...

00:08:19.874 --> 00:08:22.001
You mean humans were watching me?

00:08:22.251 --> 00:08:23.920
Amazing!

00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:26.464
I show myself as a human on the net.

00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:28.674
To hide my shiny beast form~

00:08:28.799 --> 00:08:29.967
You can go now.

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:36.265
Hey, is your dad...

00:08:37.683 --> 00:08:39.602
Ugh, I hate my dad.

00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:41.229
That's my grandpa.

00:08:41.729 --> 00:08:44.273
He was caught by humans before I was born...

00:08:44.398 --> 00:08:47.735
...boiled in soy sauce and eaten. It's what my dad says.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:48.694
What the hell.

00:08:49.028 --> 00:08:52.156
Right? There's no way!

00:08:52.281 --> 00:08:54.825
Just recently I was caught listening to human music...

00:08:54.951 --> 00:08:56.661
...so now I'm not allowed outside.

00:08:57.161 --> 00:08:59.455
They say it's "indecent and harmful".

00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:02.124
I know! Let me show you something cool!

00:09:03.125 --> 00:09:05.086
These are my treasures!

00:09:05.503 --> 00:09:09.048
They are things that washed up on the beach, or gifts I got!

00:09:09.715 --> 00:09:12.009
Is that nostalgic? Do you know what that is?

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:14.220
It seems just one piece washed up.

00:09:14.804 --> 00:09:17.807

You're really different from everyone else.

00:09:49.297 --> 00:09:52.925
People who come here don't wanna talk about the mainland.

00:09:53.843 --> 00:09:55.261
Do you wanna go back?

00:10:03.185 --> 00:10:06.397
I can't return looking like this.

00:10:09.191 --> 00:10:10.610

Ah, uh... Y-yeah!

00:10:37.928 --> 00:10:40.389
I forgot how to return to my human form...

00:10:40.514 --> 00:10:42.350

Did you forget yours? I'll let you borrow these.

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:55.853
The pain and suffering that Nina has had to face due to discrimination...

00:14:55.978 --> 00:14:58.022
...we can't even being to comprehend it.

00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:00.524
I'm sure it was very hard on you.

00:15:00.649 --> 00:15:03.152
Eh? I mean, I'm not really...

00:15:03.277 --> 00:15:07.239
Let's praise the beauty and courage of Nina's way of living!

00:15:19.376 --> 00:15:20.961
Shirou, you got a call!

00:15:21.754 --> 00:15:26.091
Oogami, do you know where Michiru is and who she's with?

00:15:26.842 --> 00:15:29.553
She's hanging out with Flip's daughter over there.

00:15:30.012 --> 00:15:32.514
If The Family finds out...

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.016
...it'll be a big problem.

00:15:34.516 --> 00:15:38.020
You want me to take them back home before anything happens.

00:15:38.145 --> 00:15:39.688
<i>Thank you.</i>

00:15:52.576 --> 00:15:55.204
You asshole! You wanna die that badly?!

00:15:55.704 --> 00:15:57.164
I have business with Flip.

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:02.378
I'm busy now. Move.

00:16:03.087 --> 00:16:05.756
Do you plan on starting a war with humans?

00:16:06.507 --> 00:16:07.967
So what if I do?

00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:10.427
I'll bring your daughter back.

00:16:11.011 --> 00:16:12.388
And why would you do that?

00:16:12.805 --> 00:16:16.934
You can either leave it to me or argue pointlessly here.

00:16:17.059 --> 00:16:18.102
Make your choice.

00:16:18.686 --> 00:16:21.563
Hm. I'll wait until midnight.

00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:25.818
If she doesn't come back before then, you're all turning into minced beef.

00:16:41.041 --> 00:16:43.002
Did you see that?

00:16:43.419 --> 00:16:46.797
Nina, let's go home.
<i>Why?</i>

00:16:47.256 --> 00:16:50.134
I don't... I don't know, but...

00:16:50.259 --> 00:16:52.052
Something's off.

00:16:52.177 --> 00:16:54.763
This isn't the place I wanted to return to.

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.891
Why? Everyone's nice, aren't they?

00:16:58.017 --> 00:17:01.729
Don't tell me you don't like this just because I'm the popular one.

00:17:02.187 --> 00:17:03.522
What are you talking about?

00:17:03.647 --> 00:17:07.483
If that's the case, just go and say you're a beastman too.

00:17:07.608 --> 00:17:09.944
I'm not going back home.

00:17:19.788 --> 00:17:23.083
What am I doing...?

00:17:28.255 --> 00:17:29.131
Yeah.

00:17:29.715 --> 00:17:32.968
I don't care if you left Animacity.

00:17:33.093 --> 00:17:33.969
Do what you want.

00:17:34.803 --> 00:17:37.139
But return Flip's daughter immediately.

00:17:37.264 --> 00:17:39.767
What? How do you know that?

00:17:39.892 --> 00:17:43.395
Flip's ready to start a war with humans.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:46.899
I'm heading over there soon. Figure it out before that.

00:17:47.024 --> 00:17:47.858
Got it?

00:17:47.983 --> 00:17:50.069
H-hold...! Why so sudden...?

00:17:52.154 --> 00:17:54.490
Seeing you entrust work to someone else...

00:17:54.615 --> 00:17:56.408
The sky might as well fall.

00:17:56.825 --> 00:17:58.410
Damn it.

00:17:58.535 --> 00:18:01.121
<i>That's the first time I've seen a beastman!</i>

00:18:01.246 --> 00:18:02.623
<i>Yeah, me too!</i>

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:08.045
<i>But isn't it actually kind of scary? She's like half a beast, isn't she?</i>

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:12.549
RIght? I wouldn't be able to live with her!

00:18:21.183 --> 00:18:22.601
What are you doing?!

00:18:22.726 --> 00:18:26.688
Nina looked tired, so I thought to put her in the water.

00:18:27.231 --> 00:18:28.899
I mean, she's a dolphin, right?

00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:35.280
Ah, Nina!

00:18:35.405 --> 00:18:36.240
Nina!!

00:19:13.485 --> 00:19:14.903
Are you okay?

00:19:16.363 --> 00:19:19.074
Let's go home.
<i>Yeah...</i>

00:19:38.552 --> 00:19:39.428
Michiru...

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:42.931
I'm sorry.
<i>Don't worry.</i>

00:19:43.056 --> 00:19:44.892
I'm the one who's sorry.

00:19:45.392 --> 00:19:47.853
If you didn't go to the human world...

00:19:47.978 --> 00:19:49.855
...you would still like it.

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:53.525
I should've stopped you.

00:19:54.026 --> 00:19:57.571
I don't particularly hate it.

00:19:58.739 --> 00:20:01.825
I mean, it was really sparkling!

00:20:06.455 --> 00:20:07.748
I see.

00:20:15.297 --> 00:20:19.968
Didn't you want to return there?

00:20:20.093 --> 00:20:23.388
That's right. I wanna leave Animacity.

00:20:24.139 --> 00:20:26.725
But not right now.

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:30.270
I wanna know more about beastmen.

00:20:30.395 --> 00:20:32.522
I feel I <i>need</i> to.

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:37.611
That's why I still wanna be in that city.

00:20:39.071 --> 00:20:41.990
You bought things using my tab.

00:20:42.407 --> 00:20:43.533
Work and pay it back.

00:20:43.659 --> 00:20:45.744
What? Make it a present!

00:20:45.869 --> 00:20:48.163
It's my birthday, you know!
<i>I don't care.</i>

00:20:48.288 --> 00:20:49.706
Cheapskate.
<i>Cheapskate?</i>

00:20:49.831 --> 00:20:51.959
Stingy wolf.
<i>Thief tanuki.</i>

00:20:52.084 --> 00:20:53.585
That's-- I mean...

00:21:03.053 --> 00:21:06.807
…An immortal body, and someone who can transform their body beyond a beast form...

00:21:07.641 --> 00:21:10.269
There's no way they're normal beastmen...

00:21:11.019 --> 00:21:12.729
...these two.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.380
