<i>To the beastman in flight...</i>

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.910
<i>...you are invading Japanese airspace without permission.</i>

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.790
<i>Please land and fill the required entry paperwork immediately.</i>

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.830
I'm a wandering albatross.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.710
That should be covered by the International Migratory Bird Convention...

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.960
<i>Beastmen don't fall under the Migratory Convention.</i>

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.130
<i>If you continue to fly, we will consider this an airspace violation and attack accordingly.</i>

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.340
No sense of humor, huh...

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.010
Civil workers are pretty strict...

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.070
<i>Pushing your own "justice" onto others and pitying them...</i>

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.240
<i>...and deciding to "help them out"...</i>

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.950
<i>...isn't that just to stroke your own ego?</i>

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.830
We were finally reunited, so why...?

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:08.790
Damn it!

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.640
This is like The Spirit of St. Louis...

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.560
...but this storm is a little rough.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.690
I'm trying my best...

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.740
What's she mean with "pushing it"?

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.170
What...?

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.940
Damn... What a screw-up.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.610
Oh! You're awake?

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.950
Oh, was that my doing?

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.200
Yeah! You made quite a nice hole.

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.870
You should go back to bed.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.040
I mean, I caused this whole mess...

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.790
...so I can't really sleep.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.590
Looks like you're fine.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.800
Be careful, girl.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.720
A gust of wind is coming.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.140
Michiru!

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.200
Heh, warm food really is the best.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.950
Been long since you last had any?

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.460
I'm always up in the sky.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.670
Are you also here in Animacity to take refuge?

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.000
We should get you registered, then.

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.510
I'm not staying for long. I'm a wandering albatross, after all.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.260
Wandering? Are you migrating?

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:27.720
Yeah.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.100
I'm jealous...
<i>Of what?</i>

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.560
You can fly, right? And you can go anywhere.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.980
If I was able to fly, it would've been easier for me to get here.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.480
You wanna fly, girl?

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.950
What? Oh, yeah!

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.740
I looked up the Silver Wolf Order.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.240
It used to be a private religion of sorts up until half a year ago...

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.920
...but it grew exponentially and gained more power as soon as Boris Cliff joined.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.590
And their guru seems to be an old friend of that tanuki girl.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.920
They both have this "beastman disease", and they're close friends.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.140
That can't be a coincidence... right?

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.050
Did they infect one another?

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.810
If that were the case, the disease would've spread more.

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:14.390
That's true.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.850
The mystery just keeps on growing.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.360
I'll let the cult stay for now.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.360
If they're infected, it's best to keep them under observation.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.740
<i>Mayor, you have a visitor.</i>

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.030
I don't have anything in my schedule.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.200
<i>That's...</i>

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.580
Apologies for the sudden visit.

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.670
It's been a while, Mayor Rose Barbarei.

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.670
President Alan. To think you'd humble me with a visit...

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.920
I'm sorry. I visited on a whim.

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.640
I'm Alan Sylvasta.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.850
The boss of Sylvasta Pharmaceutics. Nice to meet you.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.310
I'm Shirou Oogami.

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.060
Do you dislike handshakes?

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.310
Yeah. I don't want human smell on me.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.110
I see. My apologies.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.070
Mr. Oogami is the Mayor's advisor.

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.450
He's been helping ever since Animacity was established.

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.110
That means we're in the same position.

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.330
I fund the city, and you use your intelligence.

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.790
Thank you for your work in Sylvasta Pharmaceutics' bomb incident.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.790
You knew about that...

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:25.090
You and that cute assistant of yours exposed the foolish crimes of Mr. Yaba and his companions.

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:26.550
I got the reports about it.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.800
Cute assistant?

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.840
Am I wrong? I mean that tanuki girl.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.180
She's not cute.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.890
Hahaha... I'm just being polite. Don't take it too seriously.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.110
I'm sorry for coming here uninvited.

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.320
It seems you want that Silver Wolf Order to stay here.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.400
It's best if you drop that.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.660
If we do that, the whole purpose of this city collapses.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.490
That's true.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.460
Animacity is meant to be a refuge for oppressed beastmen.

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.710
By living here, they get used to the human way of living...

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.050
...and learn how to behave in order to coexist with humans.

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:12.680
I resonated with that, so as the human representative, I chose to give you financial aid.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.970
That's right. Animacity rejects no beastmen.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:16.930
So why?

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.890
Heheh... a whim, perhaps?

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.690
Wow, those are some nice fangs! As expected of a wolf beastman.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:27.690
Oogami!

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.570
I'm sure the successor of the Sylvasta Conglomerate...

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.910
...isn't someone who would act on a whim.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.030
You think too highly of me.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.750
I just think the Silver Wolf Order isn't needed in Animacity.

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:43.080
Why?

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.750
Beastmen continue to modernize themselves...

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:49.460
...so inviting a beastman cult would have an adverse effect, wouldn't it?

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:51.420
It would encourage anti-beastmen.

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:52.800
Did you know?

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:57.260
The Parliament, the members of anti-beastmen movements, journalists...

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:02.770
Lately, the leaders of beastmen rights movements
have been getting attacked at every opportunity by them.

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:06.400
There's also info on an unidentified flying beastman trespassing.

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:09.230
Of course, the decision making is up to you.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:14.490
Depending on your decision, I might need to change my opinion.

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:17.780
Is that a threat?
<i>It's a warning.</i>

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:23.370
I'll be in charge of looking over the chief-less Medical Center from now on.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:27.880
I'd like to keep trusting you with Animacity like I have until now.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:29.840
Farewell.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.180
This feels great! Whoa!

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.010
The wind in this city is very peculiar.

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:41.850
Gotcha!

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:51.820
Whoa! That's amazing!

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:53.650
How do you "catch the wind"?

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.370
How? You just know after getting used to it.

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:00.620
Where the wind starts and where it wants to go...

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:04.910
I learned that from my father. And my father, from my grandfather, and so on.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.500
Technically, it's down to humidity or pressure in the air...

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.920
Well, there are a few complications...

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.340
...but a beastman's body remembers.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.050
Must be nice being so free...

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:20.010
Free... Well, it used to be like that.

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:26.100
We're albatross beastmen. Like regular albatrosses, we migrate.

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:28.270
We've been doing that for generations.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:32.820
When beastmen started having the same rights as humans...

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:34.820
...migrating was prohibited.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.490
You need a proper passport to cross national borders...

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:40.200
...and need to go through proper migration procedures.

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:42.660
I see...

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:46.540
It's the route my ancestors had to fly through.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.130
It's rooted deep within our bodies.

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:51.380
We can't change that now.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:55.550
<i>"Why do we have to accommodate to humans' convenience?"</i>

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:59.010
We had friends who said that and flew either way, only to be shot down.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.720
Saying it was "trespassing".

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:03.930
That's terrible...

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:07.390
Beastmen are bound by the rules of humanity.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:12.360
Are humans really all that...?

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:16.610
Could I have one of those?

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.280
These are made for beastmen.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.740
Ah, can you tell I'm a human?

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:22.200
By the smell.

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:24.660
Is that so? Oh well. Just give me one.

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:26.410
Here you go.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:32.590
Yeah. I really can't drink this.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.590
Are you really going with what that kid said?

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:39.380
Don't underestimate him just because he's young.

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:43.300
The Sylvasta Conglomerate has been prestigious in Europe for generations.

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:47.060
They're looking to make Alan their leader.

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:52.940
You know the source of income for this city comes directly  from Sylvasta Pharmaceutics' financial aid, don't you?

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.440
That cult is fishy.

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:58.570
But I dislike the idea of following a human's orders even more.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:03.530
We have to make a decision either way.

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:05.530
Even if it results...

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:09.290
...in making enemies among beastmen.

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.630
<i>We have confirmation from the government.</i>

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:18.670
<i>It seems they've lost track of the bird beastman who trespassed into Animacity.</i>

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:22.970
<i>They say it's likely he's a terrorist who opposes the beastmen rights movement.</i>

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:27.100
It seems what Alan said wasn't just a threat after all.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.770
What's that fool doing?

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:42.660
Alright, the sightseeing flight is over, girl.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.290
Here. Sorry, they're dollars...

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:50.500
...but this is to pay for the roof.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.460
I'll probably be gone by tomorrow. This is goodbye.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.170
You're leaving already?

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:58.130
Well, I'm an albatross.

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:00.050
You're right.

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:02.840
At least tell me your name.

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:04.180
Pinga.

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:14.850
See ya, Mr. Pinga! If you come to the city again, make sure to stop by!

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:26.910
Where's that bird beastman?

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:28.830
Oh, you mean Pinga?

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:30.300
He left.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:32.160
What?

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:35.420
He might be a terrorist.

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:38.250
Terrorist? No way~

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:41.130
He said he'll leave the city tomorrow.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.760
Then he might do something tonight.

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:46.050
What's with you?

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.140
I'm telling you he's not like that.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.100
Are you sure about that? You just flew together for a bit.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:53.930
Don't say it like that...

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:57.190
I mean... why do you know we went flying?

00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:02.110
I saw you both recklessly flying around from the town hall.

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:05.990
It wasn't reckless! Not at all.

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:07.780
You just don't get it.

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:08.740
What?

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:11.620
I didn't know...

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:15.960
I didn't know beastmen weren't happy even if they have their rights.

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:19.670
Albatross problems...
<i>You knew about this?</i>

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:23.920
Pinga said he even had friends who were shot down.

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:26.430
They must've had their reasons.

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:29.390
C'mon... Why do you always assume the worst?

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:34.140
It seems anti-beastmen terrorist groups are forming in Animacity.

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:36.810
They're bird beastmen, too.

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:40.060
This timing can't be a coincidence.

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:42.730
There's also no time to argue about it.

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:46.450
We should find him and clear any suspicions then, right?

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:47.950
If we can clear them.

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:49.780
Can't you find him by smell?

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:53.580
The sky is my weak point. All remaining smell must've dissipated by now.

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:55.700
Is there any other way?

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:58.170
Even if there isn't, he's a target.

00:13:58.290 --> 00:13:59.540
Wait!

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:17.810
<i>The Silver Wolf Order was looking to settle in Animacity, but Mayor Rose refused their request.</i>

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:21.940
<i>She is preparing an alternate refuge, and is currently negotiating.</i>

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:26.110
<i>The mayor is saying "we don't have the required infrastructure to usher them in"...</i>

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:31.200
<i>...and "we will temporarily relocate them, but we are making preparations to bring them into our city soon".</i>

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.740
Is this alright?

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:38.660
Yes. Everything is going according to plan.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.130
Hey! The cult is moving!

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:49.260
What? Seriously?
<i>Yeah. Ginrou-sama is leading them.</i>

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.140
Ginrou-sama?

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:57.640
We, the Silver Wolf Order, wished to settle in Animacity.

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:01.600
However, Mayor Rose refused our wish.

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:04.520
This is due to concerns from Sylvasta Pharmaceutics.

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:08.320
However, we are not the fanatics they think we are.

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:11.160
We only wish for a paradise for beastmen.

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:16.160
Let us pray! To dissipate any and all misunderstandings!

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.420
Rejoice!

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:29.300
Ginrou is an entity who protects beastmen.

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:34.390
Her light will bring about eternal calm to all beastmen!

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:39.430
The cult is right in front of the Medical Center.

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:42.900
It seems they noticed President Alan's interference.

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:45.860
This isn't a message from the gods... is it?

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:50.320
A lot of people saw him come into the Town Hall.

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:53.160
In any case, contact the police.

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:57.030
Just to take a look at the situation. No violence.

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:19.140
Alright, let's go.

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:32.990
What are you doing?!

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.240
Terrorists in Animacity are unforgivable!

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:43.460
I'd love it if you didn't get in my way.

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:48.340
Shirou!

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.550
Damn it, if I could just fly...!

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:55.220
Don't think badly of me!

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:23.790
Agh, I...

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:26.500
want... to...!

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:31.920
You can fly?!

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:33.800
This is a first for me!

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.630
A first?!
<i>Yeah!</i>

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:39.390
Can you catch up to him?

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.140
Leave it to me!

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:51.860
Hold on! Is that even possible?

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:57.490
You won't get away this time.

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:10.710
You're the tanuki girl.

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:12.920
Was I being fooled?

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:15.760
You're an ex-soldier, aren't you?

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:19.380
Yeah, I used to be in the military when I was young.

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:24.350
I believed in beastmen rights and fought against anti-beastmen extremists.

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:26.980
To think that would result in being unable to fly...

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:28.890
...without thinking of the consequences...

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:30.810
And that's why...

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.730
That's why you think being a terrorist is okay?

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:35.980
Did you really plan on attacking the Mayor?

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:38.030
The bomb was a bluff.

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:40.030
It isn't lethal at all.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:43.410
I had that as a threat so they would listen to me.

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:46.290
Government officials wouldn't listen to me, either way.

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:48.790
So? What will you do?

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:51.750
I just want to protect this city.

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:53.210
Go.

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:54.960
Right now.

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:57.710
You haven't done anything yet.

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:01.890
Girl...

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:08.980
These are my comrades who were caught up in the conflict for beastmen rights and died.

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:14.310
If this is a beastman city, then I want to make tombs for them here.

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:17.110
Please tell that to the Mayor.

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:18.280
Yeah.

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:21.530
I'll tell her. I promise.

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:25.620
Oh, right. I wasn't the only one flying to this city.

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:27.620
There's someone else.

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:31.080
There's only one beastman I know who could go that fast.

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:34.210
In the "dark-side", we call him "Meteor".

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:38.670
He's a hitman who will do anything for money. Be careful.

00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:41.130
Is he targeting the Mayor?

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:43.890
No. If that was the case, I would know about it.

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:46.470
That means...

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:51.310
President, going out is dangerous!

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:55.270
Don't worry. Running and hiding would just make things worse.

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:15.210
Are we too late?
<i>What is that?</i>

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:17.000
Can you fly again?

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:40.360
Look! Look at Ginrou and her wings!

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:45.110
Her grace befalls not only beastmen, but humans far and wide as well!

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:50.080
Our founder, Ms. Déesse Louve, is just...

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:53.500
the one who will save the world of beastmen!

00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:57.670
You failed. Give it up.

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:24.440
Listen! Listen to the voices of the citizen!

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:28.570
Can you disregard these voices, Alan Sylvasta?

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:32.040
Damn, I'm done for.

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:41.420
Amazing...

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.920
You're amazing, Nazuna.
