00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:05.810
Are you kidding me, Mari?!

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.310
This cigar set I bought from you...

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.770
...more than half of it is filled with carrots!

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.190
No matter how much of a horse you think I am...

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.820
...carrots ain't a replacement for cigars!

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.700
Give me my money back!

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.660
C'mon, I showed you the photo, didn't I?

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.080
Asking if this was okay.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.870
You looked at this and agreed!

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.750
I'm not foolin' you or anything.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.710
If you get it, drop that horse face of yours and go home.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.420
See ya.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:43.560
What's with that...

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.810
What's wrong, Mari?

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.980
I don't know! He just went out of control.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.480
I'll leave this to you!

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.570
I'm running away like a hare! <i>(I'm a mink though!)</i>

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.070
Shirou, that's...!

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.820
The same that happened to Yaba.
<i>Then...</i>

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.750
Now!
<i>Got it!</i>

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.760
Mayor! There's a rampaging beastman in the city...

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.720
Oogami is dealing with it accordingly.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.850
Understood, I'll go as well.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.480
President Alan? I'm sorry, I'm a bit busy...

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.940
I'm aware of it...

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.900
...and we need to talk.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.710
Can you deal with this...?
<i>Yeah. I won't kill him this time.</i>

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.090
We did it!

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.100
What's all this?

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.260
Shirou!

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.590
I'm okay.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:39.900
We're going after them.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.370
The Medical Center?

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.710
They're definitely here.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.290
It'll be dangerous from now on. You should go back...

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.090
Hey! You should listen when...

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.340
I can't accept you getting shot all the time...

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.090
...and I wanna know what all that was.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.590
Besides, you're on edge.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.350
You get worked up as soon as it's about Sylvasta.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.430
Letting you go in alone is much more dangerous.

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.270
Let's go. I've been here before, so I know how to sneak in.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.330
Didn't you know how to sneak in?

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.250
<i>Oogami.</i>

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:44.170
<i>This is a medical facility. Would you refrain from acting violently?</i>

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.510
Alan?

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:46.970
<i>Hello, Michiru.</i>

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.390
Perfect timing. I have to ask you something.

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:51.470
<i>Of course.</i>

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.310
<i>You guys. Lead the way.</i>

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.270
I didn't know they had this kind of facilities here.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.150
It's odd.
<i>What is?</i>

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.740
There are only humans here.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.320
This Medical Center should be beastmen-centered.

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.910
Is it the smell?
<i>Yeah.</i>

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.450
I was going to recover the body in secret, but...

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.660
...I didn't know you were taking care of it.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.540
So those machines are the Medical Center's?

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:23.130
What are those anyways?

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.380
Those are Engel Machines.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.170
It's medical equipment to protect beastmen.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.970
Medical equipment?
<i>She was shot, you know.</i>

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.260
My apologies for that.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:36.100
They're meant to be used on rampaging beastmen.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.480
We tranquilized that horse beastman to protect him, too.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.560
They probably mistook Michiru for a target.

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.520
That was live ammo.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:50.110
They were quickly dispatched by a subordinate when I was absent, so that was an equipment mistake.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.320
I deeply apologize.

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:55.740
I will make sure this doesn't happen again.

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.910
The rampaging beastman is being treated here.

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:00.460
More live experiments?

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.670
That is unforgivable in Animacity.

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.170
Judging by your reply, you're ready to tear me apart.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.760
That's the plan.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.420
Shirou! Calm down!

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:11.840
What are you trying to do in this city?

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:13.930
You won't talk your way out of this one.

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:18.930
Alright. It'd be better if I explained everything to you.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.150
We need samples from rampaging beastmen.

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.150
I know this is rough, but there's no time.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:27.400
Administer the prototype.

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:30.950
What are you doing?!

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.660
Could you pull back those teeth and claws for a moment?

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:37.910
I can't have you recklessly clawing at my throat.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:42.170
If things stay like they are, Animacity will be destroyed.

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:44.380
Like Nirvasyl.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.170
You know about that city...?

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:52.880
The general leading the soldiers back then...

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.340
...was Raymond Sylvasta.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.600
Sylvasta...
<i>That's right.</i>

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:02.600
My ancestor.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.950
Stop it. Do you plan on letting rage consume you and get Michiru involved?

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.410
You bastard!

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:19.040
I just want you to listen to me calmly.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:22.830
Oogami, you misunderstand.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.880
It wasn't the humans who targeted beastmen in Nirvasyl.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.960
It's the opposite. Humans were targeted by beastmen and they protected themselves.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:35.840
When the human military arrived, the beastmen were already killing each other!

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:37.300
That's ridiculous!

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:40.100
Why do you think humans defeated the beastmen?

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.020
This was a thousand years ago. There were no guns or explosives!

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.980
With dull blades, heavy shields and arrows...

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.980
Does that compare to the attacks of agile beastmen?

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:53.990
Beastmen were fighting and hurting each other...

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:56.160
...the humans just laid the final blow.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.820
Don't talk like you were there!

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.700
Then I'll ask you since you <i>were</i> there.

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:06.040
Aren't you reminded of something? I know you are a Nirvasyl survivor.

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:08.210
...! Why do you...?

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.800
I've looked into you before.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:12.630
That's not all.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:17.930
The story of a silver wolf looking for revenge has been passed down for generations, too.

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:21.260
You gave up on that meaningless revenge, so you should know.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:25.560
Did humans really slaughter beastmen back then?

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:28.270
Did beastmen really not target each other?

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:30.860
Like Yaba did in a blind rage?

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.110
That's... But...

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:45.410
Originally, beastmen of the same kind were living scattered all around.

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.960
They weren't used to living with different beastmen.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.880
The stress of having your own territory invaded by other species...

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.710
...unconsciously built up.

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:58.510
Having that sort of mental shock in that state...

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:04.270
...activated a "switch" that overloaded their Beast Factor, and their violent instincts amassed.

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:07.980
That's the Beast Factor Breakout Syndrome...

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.400
...the "Nirvasyl Syndrome".

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:15.610
I've analyzed the Beast Factor of the beastmen of this city.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:19.320
Their intracerebral aggressiveness values are rapidly increasing.

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:23.410
If the beastmen population keeps increasing, they'll go overboard.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.710
I see, that's why you had the cult move...

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:30.880
What about the Mayor? Does she know about this?

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:34.840
Of course, I talked to her. She agrees.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.840
A place where beastmen can live rightfully...

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:42.760
A peaceful world to live in...

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:47.220
That's all I wished to create with this city, but...

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:51.150
...was that all wrong?

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:56.070
Have I been creating a beastman hell for the past 10 years?

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:58.150
Are you agreeing with President Alan...?

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:01.490
I checked the data from Sylvasta.

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:04.450
There are no flaws in Alan's theory.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:08.370
Contact Prime Minister Shiramizu immediately.
<i>Understood.</i>

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.670
The reason behind the creation of this Medical Center in Animacity...

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:16.670
...is to create a vaccine for the Nirvasyl Syndrome.

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:19.880
Because I can easily take samples from beastmen.

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:22.760
Wait. The vaccine you're trying to create is...

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:25.720
That's right. A vaccine to turn beastmen into humans.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:31.640
"Beast Factor Termination Vaccine". If we stop beastmen from transforming, the Nirvasyl Syndrome will not happen.

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:35.560
That's the cure for my beastman disease?

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:39.030
That's right.
<i>No...</i>

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:42.070
So you're making beastmen reject the fact they're beastmen?!

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:44.200
You filthy human!

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:52.960
Shirou!

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:58.630
They're tranquilizers. Please calm down a bit.

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:02.170
All humans... are the same...

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:05.260
They all use brute force to control beastmen...

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.100
If this keeps up, beastmen will start killing each other!

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:09.770
Are you okay with that?!

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:14.520
Humans have no right... to decide that!

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.360
Shirou!

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:23.320
That's surprising. Even that amount didn't work?

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:28.030
Starting Beast Factor Termination process.

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:30.790
Alright. It's a success!

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:36.330
Stop that! Stop!

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:38.040
Why are you stopping me?!

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:41.460
I won't let humans create a drug to erase beastmen!

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:43.380
You saw it, didn't you?!

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:45.720
This guy and Yaba both rampaged!

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:49.220
Are you okay with everyone rampaging? Are you okay with slaughter?!

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:53.230
Shut up! They'll be turned into humans! <i>By humans!</i>

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.810
How about staying alive?!

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:59.480
If you destroy this, you'll be destroying everyone's chance of survival!

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:01.400
Move!
<i>I'm not moving!</i>

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:03.990
Do you want a drug to make you human that badly?!

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.740
You just want to go back to being human.

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:11.540
That's not...
<i>You're a human after all.</i>

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:14.750
There's no way you'd get how a beastman feels!

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:18.420
You're always like this! Deciding everything based on that!

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:22.170
There's no way I can understand the feelings of the legendary Ginrou!

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:25.090
Is living a thousand years really all that?

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:29.010
Haven't you just held a grudge against humans for the past thousand years?

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:32.140
W... <i>What did you say?!</i>

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:40.520
Don't move.
<i>Mr. Tachiki...</i>

00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:44.650
I received a report about a suspect rampaging at the Medical Center...

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:47.070
...but I can't believe it's you, Oogami.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.070
It's a shame, but...

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:51.950
...he's the one who destroyed all this.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:55.290
Oogami. Would you come to the station?

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:58.120
You're committing a damage to property crime.

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:01.040
Do you think you can catch me that easily?

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:03.300
I'm begging you to make it easy.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:07.260
I don't want to be your enemy, but this is my duty.

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:10.510
If you turn on the police as well, you're just a criminal.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.390
You'll be the same as those terrorists.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.110
Shirou...

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:26.070
Let's go after him.

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:29.360
It's best if we let the police handle this.

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:33.410
But...
<i>It's okay. He's a strong man.</i>

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:36.660
Once he calms down, I'm sure he'll understand.

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:40.040
Michiru, thank you.

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.800
You protected the vaccine machinery from him, did you not?

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:49.130
It's the same as you saving the lives of many beastmen.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.300
You don't really need to thank me...

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:55.010
Oh, right. Michiru.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.230
I want you to give some advice to Nazuna.

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:00.440
Nazuna?
<i>Yeah.</i>

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.940
I entrusted her with a task as well, but...

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:05.940
...I think she'll need your help.

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:07.030
What's the task?

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.450
It's something to help Animacity.

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:18.370
To think you'd come get me.

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:21.830
The Mayor has something to tell you.
<i>Figures.</i>

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:25.540
The Town Hall is being guarded by the police. Come with me.

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:31.130
Thank goodness!

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:34.350
See? Michiru came back home!

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:35.600
Yeah.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:38.350
I've been praying to Ginrou-sama.

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.890
The police came and said they were looking for Shirou...

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:43.520
...and she was worried.

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:46.770
There has to be a mistake! Where's Shirou?

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.040
Nazuna?

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:10.590
Huh. It shouldn't matter if you're a beastman or a human as long as you stay alive, right?

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:15.260
That's true, but Shirou doesn't even entertain that thought.

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.850
Did you hear about the live from Alan?

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:20.890
Live?
<i>Yeah!</i>

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:24.600
Until the cure is done, to ease the minds of stressed beastmen...

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:26.810
...the cult is holding a live event.

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:29.730
It will be streamed all throughout Animacity!

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:34.700
I asked Alan if he could get you to be part of my staff.

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:37.740
It will pretty much be my first live, after all.

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:40.040
Let's think of a setlist together!

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:45.000
Nazuna, did you know about the Nirvasyl Syndrome?

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:49.040
Yeah. Alan told me to keep that info from unrelated people...

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:53.630
...but you're already involved.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.930
Besides, there's nothing else I'd be hiding from you.

00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:59.390
Really?
<i>Probably.</i>

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:01.470
If there is, I'll apologize, so spare me~

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:04.600
What's that about? Well, that's fine.

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:08.860
A live, huh... That's amazing, Nazuna! You're like a real idol now.

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:12.320
That's right. I'll become a real idol.

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:22.080
We'll make this a success and save this city!

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:25.250
Michiru!

00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:27.250
I made some tea... Whoa!

00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:29.420
Ah, no... I mean... This is...!

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:32.920
Ginrou-sama! Why are you here?

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:36.630
I have come to get closer to my followers.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.260
I will go wherever I'm needed.

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:40.760
That's a quick change.

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:43.970
A-ah, I see...

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:46.890
This girl has been through a lot recently...

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:48.770
As expected of Ginrou-sama.

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:51.860
It is alright. I am sure she'll find her path.

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:53.320
I will be leaving now.

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:56.990
May you become a good beastman.
<i>May you become a good beastman.</i>

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:04.450
Is Ginrou-sama really all that?

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:05.700
Yeah...

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:09.920
I can't believe it's such a young girl, though.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.710
Ah, don't worry about those things.

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.960
As long as Ginrou-sama is here...

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:18.380
May you become a good beastman.

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.100
You went overboard, Oogami.

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:26.020
Do you know what Alan is trying to do?

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.730
He's trying to turn all beastmen into humans.

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:32.480
I know.
<i>Then why are you stopping me?</i>

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:35.570
"I don't care about death as long as I'm a beastman"...

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:37.650
...not all beastmen think like that.

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:39.320
Even you...

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:42.780
But I'll make sure it doesn't come to that.

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:45.950
I'm dismantling Animacity.

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:50.420
If beastmen start rampaging because the population is increasing...

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:52.960
...then dispersing them is for the best.

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.800
I will meet with Prime Minister Shiramizu tomorrow.

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:59.970
I'm going to request for beastmen to be accepted and distributed all across Japan.

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:05.310
However, if a Nirvasyl Syndrome outbreak starts happening before then...

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:08.430
...then using the vaccine will be unavoidable.

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:09.890
That's...!

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:22.070
Alright. Do what you must in your own way.

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.300
Where could he be...?

00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:01.070
What happened? I don't recall seeing rain today.

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:06.240
It's none of your business, so get lost. I'm in a bad mood.

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:09.490
Figured as much, since the police is looking for you.

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:11.540
Get on, I'll give you a ride.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000
I don't need it.

00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:15.080
Don't say that.

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:18.500
I heard you had a fight with Sylvasta.

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.380
What did you find, Oogami?

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:25.140
I know this city is becoming shadier every day.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:28.680
I wouldn't be fit to be The Family's boss if I didn't.

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:41.530
I see. It is a rather urgent matter.

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:45.570
I can't say humans and beastmen get along too well.

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:48.410
Although it's an avoidable disease...

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:51.790
If humans find out about it now, they'll needlessly become anxious.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:56.290
I beg you to distribute beastmen as quickly and quietly as possible.

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:58.670
I understand how you feel.

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:03.470
However, I can't let any beastmen leave Animacity.

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:06.680
This is...

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:10.850
I received information about the Nirvasyl Syndrome.

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:12.640
I'm already taking measures.

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:16.100
Mayor Rose, I've been requested to protect you.

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:17.270
Protect me?

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:20.020
Well, things should be going smoothly over there...

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:22.690
...so just sit back and relax.

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:24.650
Hold on a minute! Prime Minister!

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:31.330
Thank you. I appreciate your cooperation, Prime Minister.

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:38.380
Shirou?!

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:49.760
Damn... That stubborn geezer...
