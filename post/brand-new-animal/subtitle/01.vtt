00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.450
We can easily see through you!

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.750
This is the path that everyone who escapes Animacity takes.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.420
You'll bite the dust if you stick around here!

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.540
Monsters like you are multiplying...

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.460
It's a goddamn eyesore!

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.880

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.630
Excuse me!

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.850
Could you stop that~?

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.140
That kid is one of my precious customers.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.020
Please be gentle.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.110
Suddenly shooting an arrow at me...

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.660
Isn't that... a bit rude?

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.620
Let's dispose of these guys already.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:35.130
It'd be a pain in the ass if you kill them, so try to hold back a bit.

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.610
The path to Animacity is ridded with beast hunters.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.650
But you don't have to worry. I will be taking you there.

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.570
W-who are you?

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.950
I'm the one who extends her hand to beastmen in trouble...

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.450
...a loving volunteer, Mari Itami!

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:10.620
That's kind of shady.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.830
That hurts.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.210
So how much is it?

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.590
I said I was a volunteer, though...

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.260
You're the type to charge me afterwards, right?

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.470
You're not too charming, are you?

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.100
If I had any charm, I wouldn't be here right now.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.510
You're certainly right.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.270
Guess I'll take all the money you have then.

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:30.640
Are you serious?!

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:36.690
It's the price for your life, so don't be stingy about it!

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.400
Am I right?

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.780
Don't say it so happily.

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.970
Is that city really only for beastmen?

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:05.050
Yep! Animacity.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.600
Are you also an outlier?

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.610
Don't worry.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.030
You'll be able to sleep properly from now on.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.370
Yeah...

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:32.410
Alright, we're here.

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:36.330
Once you get off the boat, we're back to complete strangers.

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:39.630
Got it. Thank you!

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.660
What's this? It's way too quiet...

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.390
It's a festival!

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.230
It's the mayor!

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:20.980
Mayor Rose!
<i>It's the mayor!</i>

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:22.190
Mayor, let's go!

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:25.360
It's been ten years since Animacity was built.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:29.160
The gap between beastmen and humans hasn't been closed yet.

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:34.370
Regardless, this city continues to be the safe haven for beastmen.

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:37.870
These past ten years, and the following ten years...

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.830
No, for the sake of the future that lies beyond...

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.420
Let's celebrate the anniversary!

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.720
Everyone is really a beastman!

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:55.600
There's no need to run anymore!

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.590
Ah, I'm sorry... Huh?

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:29.510
Whoa...

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:32.300
What a nice smell...

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:36.100
It's the smell of beasts filled with joy and happiness.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:37.470
What?

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:42.230
Celebrate. It's the festival that beastmen have waited for for a thousand years.

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:43.940
O-okay...

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:46.900
There are many types of people, huh...

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:49.530
He's crying... and he's scary.

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:56.950
What's up with that guy?

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:08.420
Mayor, it's from the Prime Minister, Shiramizu.

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:13.090
Congratulations on the ten-year anniversary, Mayor Rose.

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:16.050
It is all thanks to your comprehension.

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:19.930
Ahaha, don't get me wrong, though.

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:22.640
The Beastmen Special Zone isn't impenetrable.

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:25.730
If you beastmen start behaving dangerously...

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:29.690
I don't know what could happen, or when...

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:35.490
I'm sincerely counting on you.

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:42.960
Same as always, huh. I can't tell if he's celebrating or threatening us.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.620
Even so, ten years have passed.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.710
To Rose Barbarei's ten-year fight.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.880
To ten more years of Animacity.

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:11.980
This is pretty strong!

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:15.650
Oh my, being a glutton? I knew you had more.

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:17.530
You're that weasel!

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:19.660
Not a weasel! A mink!

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:20.870
Really?

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:24.210
Don't confuse me with those cheap-fur animals!

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:25.540
Okay...

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.380
I said "all your money", didn't I?

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.250
Kids are so treacherous lately...

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:33.130
I won't give you any more money.

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.720
We're back to complete strangers, right?

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:39.140
Do I really look that selfish to you?

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.100
That makes me sad... So sad...

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:46.060
Ah! A thief!

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.190
Oh, poor thing.

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:52.730
Be careful~ Animacity is full of sneaky people like that.

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.310
Did you really...?!

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:57.150
You sure you wanna argue? The pickpocket is getting away.

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:00.320
Damn it!

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:04.160
Someone! Catch that pickpocket!

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:13.800
Hold it!

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.360
Where'd he go?

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.530
God damn it!

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:05.350
Move it!

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:08.850
Hurry up, grandpa!

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.230
Crapcrapcrapcrapcrap...!

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.950
Ouch...

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:31.120
You're the crying guy!

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:35.290
Wait, you're crying again.

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:41.430
It was you?! The one wrecked the beastmen festival?!

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:45.180
It wasn't me! I just punched a pillar!

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:46.810
And you made it explode?!

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:48.470
Are you for real?

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.980
I'm telling you it wasn't me!

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.900
That guy...

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.650
He was sneaking around those pillars!

00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:58.860
That guy?

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:39.270
It seems this was a misunderstanding. I'm sorry.

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.360
Huh?

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:45.950
The hell is up with that guy?

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:51.250
Right! The pickpocket!

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:13.680
What?

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:18.400
A bummer, isn't it? It was a smell-less bomb!

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:21.480
You can't tell even if you're a beastman!

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:26.280
Whoa!! The hell is this?!

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:37.750
That hurt...

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:39.960
Is this guy immortal or something?!

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:43.920
Spit it out. Why did you interrupt the festival?

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.340
Ouch...!

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:03.650
Huh, that was quick.

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:06.780
What's wrong, Satou? Did your trap fail?

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.280
Be careful...

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.740
That damn wolf... He completely outdid my bomb!

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.410
It seems they're pros.

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:31.720
I see...

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:33.810
Humans!

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:40.350
You bastards were bought out by humans, huh?

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:43.360
How could you tell, huh?

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:48.900
You cannot cover up such a deep human smell.

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.370
What an effective nose you have!

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.250
You were bought out by anti-beastmen humans...

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.460
You're pretty stuck on that "bought out" thing.

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.920
It doesn't matter if it's a human or a beastman.

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.840
When it comes to contracted work...

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:08.800
...we'll do it properly!

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:11.430
That's all there is to it!

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:16.270
Is that... why you ruined... the festival...?

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:19.230
You gotta be kidding me!

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:22.860
You damn...
<i>W-whoa!</i>

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:24.480
That sin...

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:26.440
You'll atone for it with your life.

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:40.580
You damn beastmen who sold their souls to humans...

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:45.340
You bastards aren't even worth using my claws on.

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:48.300
My fists are more than enough!

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:50.880
Bring it on!

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:53.930
You better not regret it!

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:19.370
Let go!

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:22.710
You, who lost the pride of a beastman...

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:25.210
...you don't need the pride of a deer!

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:26.590
Stop it... I beg you...!

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.340
My antlers... Anything but my...!

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:35.640
Stop right there, you greenhorn.

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:39.390
Branding me as a greenhorn...

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:57.950
Don't move!

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:02.410
If you move, this kid's life is done!

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:06.380
Whose life is done, you said?

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:13.300
Hold on!

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:15.300
That's horrible!

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:26.900
That's enough, isn't it? Those poor people!

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:31.190
Don't try to stop me. These guys ruined the festival.

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:35.110
They're beastmen too, though! This is...

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:38.160
These guys were hired by humans.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.580
They're a disgrace to all beastmen.

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.950
That much is right.

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:46.080
Stop it!

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:51.130
I said stop it!

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:06.270
That's enough!

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:09.350
Why are you fighting against your own people?

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:12.820
Wasn't this city a "beastmen paradise"?

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.860
That's exactly why.

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:20.280
Humans are enemies to this city.

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:22.990
Beastmen hired by humans are the same.

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:25.450
Not all humans are like that!

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:28.920
All humans are the same.

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:30.790
That's not true!

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:32.750
Because...

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:35.630
...I'm also a human!

00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:39.300
That's right...

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:41.760
I am a human...

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:46.430
...I <i>was</i> a human!

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:50.980
