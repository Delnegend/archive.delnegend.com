00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.530
Michiru!

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.870
Jackie! Why are you here?

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.250
This bread crust is delicious!

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.790
It doesn't just have the brown bits, it has white bits too!

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.040
Have you only eaten crusts?

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.920
It's great! This bread crust is delicious!

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.130
It's a Special Super Crust!
<i>Y-yay, great...</i>

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.550
<i>Even the smell is different!</i>

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.640
A friend of yours?

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.060
Yeah.
Ah, sorry for all the fuss.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.850
It's really easy for you to make friends, huh.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:51.980
Ginrou-sama!

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.190
Ginrou-sama!
<i>Ginrou-sama!</i>

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.490
Thank you for the Super Crust!

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.160
If you're hungry, you're free to come by at any time.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.870
Ginrou-sama~!

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.330
May you become a good beastman.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.080
May you become a good beastman!

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.360
Still... Is it okay to have so many beastmen gathered in the live event?

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.760
"Being positive and feeling festive is very important"...

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:22.890
...is what Alan said.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.950
Now that you mention it, there was a festival going on when I first arrived.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.730
It'll be broadcast live too...

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.690
...so I chose some fun songs for now.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.480
What do you think?

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.530
Huh? Are you gonna sing this?
<i>Is that no good?</i>

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.950
Nazuna... You always make a dumb face when you sing this song.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.910
What?

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.540
I mean, come on. <i>That</i> song isn't even in here!

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.710
Hm, that's true, but I figured it wouldn't be fitting for a live event...

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.080
That's not true!

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.380
Really?
<i>Yeah! I wanna hear it too!</i>

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.800
<i>So show me</i>

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.050
<i>that shimmer that sparkles in the night</i>

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.180
<i>and fly around as much as you want</i>

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.350
<i>Let's run around more freely</i>

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.070
<i>to look up at the stars</i>

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.570
It's decided
<i>Damn.</i>

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.820
I'm not just gonna choose whatever you like.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.450
Huh? Hey.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.910
What's this about "a revelation from the MC"?

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.630
Ah, that? That's when I'll say "Actually, I'm a human"!

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.920
Are you sure it's okay to blurt that out?

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.260
When Alan finishes the cure...

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.300
...he said it would be needed to alleviate the stress of beastmen.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.890
I... see.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.230
Humans and beastmen aren't all that different. They go about their lives very similarly.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.650
We're the ones who can say that, right?

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.190
Y... Yeah...

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:16.630
Through the roof...?!

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.050
Don't move!

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.850
Leave this to me.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.180
Hurry back to Animacity.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.560
Ishizaki, thank you!

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.110
Are the boats ready?

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.450
We have 1000 freighters ready.

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.410
We should have 5000 large cruisers in the next 5 days.

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.580
That should balance out the amount of people from the cult.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.460
Thank you.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.290
If this city disappears, it'll be a pain for me, too.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.050
Huh, to think you'd join forces.

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.800
The Silver Wolf Order is looking for you.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.010
Who started the search?

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.180
I start moving before I get asked to do it, so the profits are bigger.

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.980
It seems the tanuki girl is involved, too.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.730
It's fine if you don't wanna know, though.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.730
Just start talking.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.530
She was talking with that guru about the live event.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.700
Apparently she plans to blurt out that she's a human.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.660
Saying that "it will ease the minds of beastmen after the cure is made" or something.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.160
What?!

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.880
Hey, Nazuna. Are you really doing that confession?

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.920
I told you.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.380
It's needed to prevent the Nirvasyl Syndrome from taking over.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.760
Okay...

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:53.850
But if Shirou hears that, I bet he'll be mad.

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:57.520
Why? I'm doing this for the sake of beastmen...

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:58.950
There's no way he'll be mad.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.060
I wonder...

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.570
Ms. Déesse Louve.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.900
We should be leaving soon.

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.110
Michiru can come too, right?

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.490
People will be watching.

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.990
C'mon... It's fine just for today, isn't it?

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.040
It's fine. I have something I wanna do either way.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:16.540
Really?

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.250
I'll let the receptionist know you're coming...

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.630
...so don't be late, okay?
<i>Okay!</i>

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.460
See you later then!

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:00.580
This festival is more crowded than that time...

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.170
When did it...

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:03.580
<i>Michiru~!</i>

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.090
<i>Did I scare you?</i>

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:09.050
Mr. Gem?

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:11.260
<i>It's Ginrou-sama's live event!</i>

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.390
It's a festival!

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:15.050
Mr. Gem! Ms. Melissa!

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.180
You two made this?!

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.940
This is to show our appreciation towards Ginrou-sama.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:24.810
Before this city was built, there were some things...

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:30.110
...that hurt deep within our hearts that we'd rather not remember.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.530
Of course, that applies to us, too.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:37.410
So we wanted to show just how much Ginrou-sama's legend...

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.950
...helped us stay afloat back then.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.710
That's why everyone made this!

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:43.710
Everyone...?

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:47.670
Yeah! Every beastman in Animacity participated!

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:52.090
It carries the gratefulness of being protected for a thousand years.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:56.100
It might not reach Ginrou-sama, though.

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:02.810
I'm sure everyone's feelings will make it through!

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:06.110
I'm sure Ginrou-sama would cry tears of joy.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.610
That would be nice!

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:10.990
I'm sure it will!

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:13.110
Thank you, Michiru.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.370
Michiru?

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:23.830
Where's Michiru?

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:26.880
Who knows? She hasn't come here yet.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.800
Damn it. She still doesn't care about being on time.

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:33.760
Where is he?

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:40.770
Shirou...

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:51.280
In any case, Kuromaki will get The Family's things onto the boat.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.440
Only the slum people are left.

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:55.700
It'll be easy as long as we offer money.

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.660
Mari, you're good with words.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:00.830
Get as many people out of that venue as you can.

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:02.540
Leave it to me.

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:08.630
Do you need that?
<i>Failure is not an option.</i>

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:10.670
If that's the case, we'll go too.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.590
We can't be flashy or provoke the audience.

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:15.930
I'll call you in case things go awry.

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:18.430
I'll deal with the guru myself.

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:55.380
Shirou!

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:57.930
It's almost time.

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:02.720
The lost beastmen patiently wait for your appearance.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:08.060
You can do it, Nazuna. You'll be the real deal.

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:18.030
This road is swarming with police and beastmen suppresion forces.

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:21.990
Aside from that, the entrance to Animacity is full of inspectors.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:25.290
I don't think walking there is an option, Mayor.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.210
Are you perhaps Pinga?

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.460
As expected of the Mayor. You know your stuff.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.170
Why are you here?

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:42.350
I found out things are getting pretty bad by intercepting government calls.

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:46.560
When I came back to investigate, I saw you being chased by humans.

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:50.200
It'd be a pain if you got killed before making the graves for my comrades.

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:53.400
And I don't want the efforts of the tanuki girl to go to waste.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.820
Those are anti-beastmen mobile weapons.

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:00.780
Weapons?

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:05.160
Yeah. I saw those being used in anti-beastmen riots.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.910
That's...! We must hurry to Animacity!

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.370
That's the plan!

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:17.380
What should I do...?

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:32.650
Why...

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:34.360
Shirou.

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:37.110
Don't get in my way.

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:24.360
<i>The soul who walked towards</i>

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:27.240
<i>the place where light shines</i>

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:30.870
<i>together with much compassion</i>

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.670
<i>we'll see an endless dream</i>

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:44.010
I'm sorry! The feelings you have regarding beastmen...

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:46.010
...I should've been able to understand.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.510
I turned from a human to a beastman.

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:52.980
I knew the most about the fear of turning into someone else.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.980
But I didn't pay attention to how you felt.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.320
So I needed to apologize.

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:01.440
You...

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:03.900
But it's becoming confusing again.

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:08.910
What are you trying to do? Why do you have a gun...?

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:11.370
I won't get it unless you tell me!

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:14.750
Nazuna is my friend!

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.460
Why are you trying to...

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.420
Why...

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:28.670
I'm sorry.

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:32.680
I don't want to hurt your friend.

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:34.730
But this live event...

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:39.100
No... I've got to stop that confession from happening.

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:42.440
If the guru confesses she's a human...

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:45.400
It will trigger the Nirvasyl Syndrome.

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:50.280
When will she talk about her identity?

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:52.870
Is the confession really a trigger?

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:56.540
I'm sure of it. Beastmen are stubborn.

00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:00.290
Their emotions are deeper, and their prejudices are strong.

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:03.050
If they find out they were tricked by those they believe in...

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:05.380
The shock that would cause is incomparable.

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.470
They will rampage.

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:10.640
So the exact opposite of what Alan told Nazuna?

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:12.890
Alan told her knowing this.

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:15.140
What? For what?

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.850
I don't know.

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:20.060
Either way, stopping the confession comes first.

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:22.690
Are you able to persuade her?

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:27.570
<i>We're suddenly upside down</i>

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.320
<i>and the world changes around us</i>

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:32.530
She flies above the audience during this song...

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:37.000
...then she moves to the opposite side of the stage and changes costumes. That's when...

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:38.960
The opposite side...

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:41.330
I'll fly. It'll be faster that way.

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.420
Don't provoke the audience. I'll go there later.

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:45.710
Got it.

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:53.300
<i>I feel like crying, but I don't want to lose</i>

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:55.260
<i>So show me</i>

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:58.850
<i>that shimmer that sparkles in the night</i>

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:00.980
<i>and fly around...</i>

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:08.030
Inspector...

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:12.030
President Alan said you would definitely come this way.

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:13.240
Alan?

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:16.120
It's a shame it's come to this.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.040
Inspector, there's no time. Let me through.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.580
I can't do that. You're wanted by the police.

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:25.090
I'll make up for that sin later!

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:26.550
The city is in danger!

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:29.260
If we don't stop this, the city will be destroyed!

00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:31.220
What are you saying?

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:35.180
I want to protect all beastmen. That's really all I want!

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:39.270
I beg you! Don't make this city a living hell!

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:46.440
Phew, I made it.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:54.870
<i>There's a change in the plans. Do your confession here.</i>

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:59.290
<i>The audience is past the expected point of excitement.</i>

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:03.000
<i>Let's make every effort to move forward.</i>

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:04.250
Got it.

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:09.170
Everyone! Are you excited?

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:11.170
What? This isn't in the schedule!

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:15.930
<i>I'm very excited, too!</i>
This is bad...!

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:24.270
Having so many people gathered here today...

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.610
Thank you so much, everyone!

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.820
May you become a good beastman!

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:34.070
<i>May you become a good beastman!</i>

00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:36.660
May you become a good beastman!

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:39.540
<i>May you become a good beastman!</i>

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:52.840
Actually...

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:56.300
There's something I really want to tell everyone today.

00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:59.010
<i>What~?
What is it?</i>

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:01.180
That's...

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.120
Nazuna!
<i>Michiru?!</i>

00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:21.540
Don't do the confession!
<i>Huh?</i>

00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:27.790
Please. Trust me!

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:33.420
Something I really want to tell everyone.

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:35.630
That is...

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:41.600
...how grateful I am for everyone that made this big Ginrou!

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:43.390
Thank you!

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:48.520
You'd better explain this later.

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:50.360
Yeah!

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:55.190
...She did it.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:11.960
That's...!

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:17.090
Oogami!

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.820
Don't let her fool you!

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:42.410
She is nothing like Ginrou-sama! She is a human!

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:44.120
Boris?

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:46.750
I was being fooled, too.

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:50.790
She became a beastman thanks to a drug made by Sylvasta!

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:54.340
She pretended to be Ginrou-sama and tricked all of us!

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:59.260
A human dared to trick us with the sacred Ginrou!

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:03.140
A human?
<i>Ginrou-sama is a human...?</i>

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:05.260
No way...
<i>Were we tricked?</i>

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:09.390
She tried to trick and control all the noble beastmen!

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:13.230
We were tricked! By a damn human!

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.730
There is no forgiving something like this!

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:22.110
It's the work of a human!

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.870
Humans want to destroy beastmen using those weapons!

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.700
Nazuna!

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:09.620
Thank you!

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.210
Just like planned.

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:26.850
Damn! They keep coming...

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:30.810
Oogami!

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:47.780
This is...!

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:52.160
I was...

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:55.620
...unable to save them again...?

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:59.090
How am I the protector of beastmen?!

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:04.010
I...

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.840
...am useless...

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:13.810
I... I...!

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:21.690
Shirou?

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.400
Oogami...

00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:29.910
Stop, Oogami!

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:36.580
Shirou, stop!

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:42.000
Shir...

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:50.300
Michiru!
