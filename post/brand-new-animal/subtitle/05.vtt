Last night's game ended on a 6-2 with Wild Calling taking the win...

00:01:05.522 --> 00:01:07.984
Night Runners, the losers' death count amounted to three.

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:10.487
In that game, the last remaining dodo beastman...

00:01:10.612 --> 00:01:14.699
...died from the double play, so dodo beastmen are officially extinct.

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:16.409
Next up...

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:23.416
Aren't you able to return to your human form?

00:01:23.541 --> 00:01:25.960
That's true... but changing into my human form...

00:01:26.085 --> 00:01:28.338
...I feel like I'm wearing heels all the time.

00:01:28.463 --> 00:01:30.173
You know what I mean?
<i>Not at all.</i>

00:01:30.298 --> 00:01:33.301
It's more convenient to be in this form when needed.

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:37.388
So being a tanuki is more convenient...

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:40.350
Ms. Melissa!

00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:44.395
Are there no basketball circles or a basketball association in this town?

00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:45.522
Basketball?

00:01:45.647 --> 00:01:47.440
I wanna have a match!

00:01:47.565 --> 00:01:50.443
My body grows dull if I don't play, after all...

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:53.154
Matches, huh... There are!

00:01:53.488 --> 00:01:55.698
Oh, really?

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.496
See? A match!

00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:04.290
This is baseball, though. It's no basketball...

00:02:04.415 --> 00:02:07.669
Well, they both involve chasing a ball and running around...

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:09.795
...so they're not so different, are they?

00:02:11.172 --> 00:02:14.217
Hello to the 5-6 baseball fans of Animacity!

00:02:14.342 --> 00:02:16.845
The pink flamingos are as cute as always!

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.806
Bears, the bear team facing them, looking as foolish as always...

00:02:20.265 --> 00:02:22.559
...here to update their growing consecutive losses!

00:02:22.684 --> 00:02:25.520
Wow, everyone's playing in their beast form!

00:02:27.438 --> 00:02:32.026
Heeeeeey! Heeeeeeeeeeeeey!

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:33.903
<i>Heeeeeeeeeeeeeey!</i>

00:02:34.028 --> 00:02:35.822
Alright...!

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.966
I-I-I... It's a miracle ball!

00:02:55.091 --> 00:02:57.218
Ah! Damn it...

00:02:58.136 --> 00:03:01.472
Changing from attack to defense, the pink girls are defending now!

00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:03.099
Hit!

00:03:08.062 --> 00:03:09.063
Out~

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.700
For real?!

00:03:12.108 --> 00:03:16.779
Hold on! Something just came out of that girl's feather, something pointy and stabby!

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.239
So what?

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:19.365
The hell are you?

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:24.245
You're one of those bitches who proclaim justice and tell on people! A justice bitch!

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:29.709
Would you look at that, tanuki girl. We meet again.

00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:31.210
Ah...
<i>M-I-N-K.</i>

00:03:31.336 --> 00:03:33.630
Not a weasel, but Mari the Mink.

00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:35.215
I didn't say anything yet!

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:37.383
So who are you betting on?

00:03:37.508 --> 00:03:38.176
Betting?

00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:41.596
You still don't understand a thing, as always.

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:45.516
Animacity's baseball is a complete fight to the death gambling game.

00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:49.020
They're beastmen who would kill if it means they win.

00:03:49.145 --> 00:03:53.775
It's gambling that makes spectators rejoice every time someone dies or wins.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.694
Wining or losing, living or dying.

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.781
That's the baseball of Animacity.

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:00.823
You're kidding...

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:02.867
Alright, it's time for the girls to attack!

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:05.828
And the flamingo hits!

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:07.413
Straight to the pitcher!

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:10.166
It's a hit!

00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:13.836
A direct hit to Winnie the Pooh, Bears' pitcher!

00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:15.880
He's being carried on a stretcher!

00:04:16.005 --> 00:04:18.757
Oh~ Without a pitcher, you can't go on!

00:04:18.882 --> 00:04:21.135
The bear team only has 9 people~

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:22.679
Doesn't that mean we win?

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:24.973
Coach!

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:28.726
Coach! C-o-a-c-h!

00:04:28.851 --> 00:04:32.647
Yes, nice, batting, a hole in one~

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.359
Pitcher change with that girl!

00:04:36.734 --> 00:04:37.819
Eh? Me?

00:04:38.027 --> 00:04:40.488
No no no...!
<i>It's okay, don't worry.</i>

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:42.365
Let's close up the gap!

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.367
<i>Yeah!</i>

00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:45.910
Change of pitcher for the Bears!

00:04:46.035 --> 00:04:49.706
No matter how you look at it, it's a newbie tanuki girl!

00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:52.333
Even so...
<i>Hey bitch!</i>

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:55.253
Yeah, you! Would you hurry up~?

00:04:55.378 --> 00:04:59.257
You're also a tanuki on top of being ugly, I feel so bad I'm about to cry!

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:02.969
But I have an appointment with a nail salon afterwards, so I have no time for sympathy~

00:05:03.073 --> 00:05:08.057
If you're not gonna throw, you might as well go back to Kachikachi-yama! How 'bout you make a mud boat as well~?

00:05:09.058 --> 00:05:11.602
Actually, you're all so ugly, I can't help but feel bad...

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:17.859
Sneering at people, laughing about things you were born with and can't change...

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:23.489
...putting labels on people and acting like you've already won!

00:05:28.703 --> 00:05:30.204
Sexy strike~!

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.206
For real?!

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:36.586
An incredible miracle ball is born!

00:05:37.211 --> 00:05:38.046
Shit!

00:05:40.298 --> 00:05:41.424
Strike!

00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:42.383
Strike!

00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:43.593
Strike!

00:05:43.718 --> 00:05:44.594
Strike!

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:45.511
Strike!

00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:48.347
Strike! Strike! Strike!

00:05:48.473 --> 00:05:49.515
Batter out!

00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:51.434
We're almost at the end!

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:53.895
The Bears might actually have a chance!

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.397
The batter's the miracle ball tanuki girl!

00:05:56.731 --> 00:06:00.234
I have to make a mud boat in Kachikachi-yama, so~

00:06:00.359 --> 00:06:01.611
Would you hurry it up~?

00:06:01.944 --> 00:06:03.488
Damn you!

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:10.286
Hit~!

00:06:10.703 --> 00:06:11.996
She got it!

00:06:12.413 --> 00:06:14.957
She got it! What a surprise!

00:06:15.416 --> 00:06:17.418
A turnaround victory for the Bears!

00:06:20.713 --> 00:06:23.174
Oogami, have you ever tried baseball?

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:24.133
No.

00:06:24.592 --> 00:06:27.220
What about baseball gambling?

00:06:27.345 --> 00:06:31.057
I want you to find evidence of the growing baseball gambling in the city.

00:06:31.182 --> 00:06:35.978
Flip from The Family is in charge of the gambling. That's the unspoken rule, isn't it?

00:06:36.104 --> 00:06:38.147
It's hard to deal with that.

00:06:39.148 --> 00:06:43.486
Dodo beastmen went extinct yesterday, due to baseball.

00:06:44.445 --> 00:06:48.407
What sort of beastmen will go extinct next thanks to baseball, I wonder?

00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:52.286
We don't have any money♪

00:06:52.411 --> 00:06:56.040
But we don't have any dreams either♪

00:06:56.165 --> 00:06:59.252
But if it's about desires♪

00:06:59.377 --> 00:07:03.506
We have more than plenty♪

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.717
It's a bit cramped, but come in!

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:10.972
Whoa, it's really cramped.

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:14.642
Our water supply was cut so I brought water from the park.

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:16.185
Here you go.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.312
I have a request for you.

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:21.232
Please become the pitcher for the Bears!

00:07:21.357 --> 00:07:23.484
We beg you!

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:27.238
We beg you!

00:07:27.363 --> 00:07:29.115
H-hold on!

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.616
Look, I'm not even a bear!

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.244
Raccoons are also welcome!

00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:35.705
We don't discriminate against types of bears.

00:07:37.081 --> 00:07:39.208
I'm really glad we won today!

00:07:39.333 --> 00:07:42.086
We've never won other than by default.

00:07:42.211 --> 00:07:44.714
With you here, we could actually win the championship!

00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:46.591
<i>Championship...</i>

00:07:46.716 --> 00:07:49.969
I really can't play baseball. I'm sorry.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:53.181
I'm really sorry.

00:07:59.687 --> 00:08:01.606
It was a short-lived dream...

00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:04.066
If we don't have a pitcher, we can't play.

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:06.527
Baseball is all we have, too...

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:10.364
Being born here means muddy water for life...

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.492
For life...

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:15.578
Okay, I get it! I'll do it!

00:08:17.663 --> 00:08:19.916
However, absolutely no killing!

00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:21.501
Eh? Why?

00:08:21.876 --> 00:08:24.879
I'll play baseball but I won't participate in a killing game.

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:27.298
Okay, no killing, but what about hurting?

00:08:27.423 --> 00:08:28.966
No.
<i>Twisting a finger?</i>

00:08:29.091 --> 00:08:30.801
No.
<i>Cutting nails?</i>

00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:31.969
<i>Not even a hangnail?</i>

00:08:32.094 --> 00:08:35.722
No, no, I said no!!

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:39.809
Hello to the poverty-stricken and people with free time.

00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:41.312
Today's baseball match:

00:08:41.645 --> 00:08:46.567
The uneasy-looking Bears who spent all their luck of their lives in the last match to turn it around...

00:08:47.068 --> 00:08:50.738
...and the heavy-weight stars of the baseball gambling world, the Buffalos!

00:08:50.863 --> 00:08:51.989
Alright, play ball!

00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:54.867
The poor, foolish Bears are attacking!

00:08:56.661 --> 00:08:59.622
An unusually sluggish ball... They got it!

00:08:59.747 --> 00:09:02.124
Running against each other... First base, safe!

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.790
The Bears coach is making signs! They're pretty easy to understand!

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:06.879
Hey, they're catching on!

00:09:07.463 --> 00:09:09.298
The Buffalos' defense at all once...!

00:09:09.423 --> 00:09:11.217
Wow, it was really a bunt.

00:09:11.342 --> 00:09:12.426
Easily out!

00:09:12.885 --> 00:09:15.388
He's signing for a bunt again! Is he serious?

00:09:15.846 --> 00:09:18.099
Or is it a sophisticated trap?

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:20.351
It's a bunt.

00:09:20.476 --> 00:09:23.145
Out! Stew and bead and bears! Stupid bears~

00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:24.689
Their fourth batter is...

00:09:24.814 --> 00:09:26.649
...the famous tanuki girl!

00:09:27.191 --> 00:09:28.818
Another see-through sign!

00:09:28.943 --> 00:09:31.070
Is he being exceedingly helpful?

00:09:36.701 --> 00:09:38.953
It's the tanuki woman's gorilla swing!

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:41.872
A long hit! The bulls are chasing it!

00:09:42.456 --> 00:09:44.333
The tanuki gorilla girl is fast!

00:09:47.044 --> 00:09:49.422
It's like she has cheetah legs!

00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:52.466
The bulls are throwing it back home!

00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:55.553
Who's faster, ball or cheetah? Ball or cheetah? Cheetah or ball?

00:09:55.678 --> 00:09:56.637
Ball or cheetah!

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:00.266
Safe!

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:04.186
Wow, who would've thought the poor, worn-down Bears would win?

00:10:04.312 --> 00:10:07.815
Like throwing money away, it's a win with no profit for anyone!

00:10:09.817 --> 00:10:11.569
You were supposed to lose, right?

00:10:13.362 --> 00:10:15.072
The profits for today!

00:10:20.202 --> 00:10:25.374
Who would bet on such a weak team for baseball and fighting like the Bears?

00:10:25.499 --> 00:10:31.297
If baseball's popularity goes down, our business goes down with it. That would be a problem, wouldn't it?

00:10:31.422 --> 00:10:34.550
Next time... Next time we'll definitely lose!

00:10:34.842 --> 00:10:37.511
<i>Next time we'll drop you into the ocean!</i>

00:10:43.142 --> 00:10:44.977
What were you doing in that shop?

00:10:45.353 --> 00:10:47.647
I was eating pizza, obviously.

00:10:47.772 --> 00:10:50.107
I'm looking for proof on baseball gambling.

00:10:50.232 --> 00:10:51.233
Would you testify?

00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:54.445
You can't keep on living if you defy The Family.

00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:58.282
Even if you hang around them, they'll just turn you into food.

00:10:58.407 --> 00:11:00.284
For us beastmen...

00:11:00.409 --> 00:11:04.121
...to make a living out of baseball, this is the only path to take.

00:11:09.418 --> 00:11:11.420
You're on the right field today.

00:11:11.545 --> 00:11:13.130
And you're the pitcher.

00:11:13.255 --> 00:11:14.423
Eh, me?

00:11:14.548 --> 00:11:18.052
Coach, Michiru is our ace! Michiru should be the pitcher!

00:11:18.177 --> 00:11:19.011
That's right!

00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:21.097
Shut up! I'm the coach here!

00:11:21.222 --> 00:11:23.391
So you better obey me!

00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:27.478
I can't be the pitcher!

00:11:27.603 --> 00:11:29.605
You'll be okay. We'll all protect you.

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:33.067
If we win this one, the finals are next! You wanna win the championship, right?

00:11:33.192 --> 00:11:35.027
Yeah!
<i>Let's get this win!</i>

00:11:35.152 --> 00:11:36.195
<i>Yeah!</i>

00:11:44.787 --> 00:11:47.164
<i>This is Dante, your new teammate!</i>

00:11:47.289 --> 00:11:49.458
<i>They say he's the first beastman player.</i>

00:11:50.668 --> 00:11:53.963
<i>We don't accept beastmen in this hotel.</i>

00:11:54.296 --> 00:11:56.841
<i>Beasts should go to the zoo!</i>

00:11:56.966 --> 00:11:58.717
<i>Beasts should go outside.</i>

00:11:58.843 --> 00:12:01.512
<i>Beasts don't need a bench, do they?</i>

00:12:04.056 --> 00:12:05.015
<i>Goddamn beast.</i>

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:07.768
<i>Hurry up and die, you goddamn beast.</i>

00:12:28.998 --> 00:12:31.709
The pitchers for the Bears today is Arai Rascal!

00:12:31.834 --> 00:12:34.086
I don't think you can win even by using an oven glove.

00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:36.922
Because his rivals are...

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.508
...the strong tiger group, Tigers!

00:12:43.762 --> 00:12:46.223
It's oooooooout... of the playfield!

00:12:46.348 --> 00:12:47.975
No one's chasing it! They won't make it!

00:12:49.268 --> 00:12:50.394
There she is!

00:12:50.519 --> 00:12:52.855
The cheetah dash of the unwavering tanuki girl!

00:12:53.272 --> 00:12:58.235
She's using the sad nature of animals who chase moving things fully in her favor!

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.654
Ah, almost there! She's so close!

00:13:00.779 --> 00:13:01.947
...Whoa, no way!!

00:13:02.573 --> 00:13:03.407
That fool...

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:05.743
Nice catch!

00:13:05.868 --> 00:13:08.078
And just like that, the Bears take the win!

00:13:08.204 --> 00:13:10.706
An immense profit of a hundred yen to ten thousand yen!

00:13:10.998 --> 00:13:13.417
The eels are replaced by the Bears in popularity!

00:13:13.542 --> 00:13:16.670
The finals are finally next!

00:13:19.548 --> 00:13:20.966
Hey, gorilla tanuki.

00:13:21.091 --> 00:13:23.969
I recall you promising not to use your powers in front of people.

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:27.097
Don't get cocky. What happens if someone finds out?

00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:28.390
I mean, yeah...

00:13:28.516 --> 00:13:30.643
If anyone finds out about your abilities...

00:13:30.768 --> 00:13:34.104
The town might as well disappear before you get the chance of curing it.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:37.233
Those Bears... They're a bit dumb and useless, but...

00:13:37.358 --> 00:13:40.486
...they love baseball. That's the first time I've ever met people like that.

00:13:41.362 --> 00:13:45.824
It's like I forgot about my beastman disease as soon as we started playing baseball...

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:48.452
You're okay with forgetting about it?
<i>Not at all...</i>

00:13:49.411 --> 00:13:52.081
...but ever since coming to this city...

00:13:52.206 --> 00:13:56.961
...no, ever since getting this beastman disease, this is the first time I've had any fun.

00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:03.425
Help!

00:14:05.469 --> 00:14:08.681
Good news! The Bears' popularity is increasing.

00:14:08.806 --> 00:14:10.891
"They're cute, like an unruly child", they say.

00:14:11.517 --> 00:14:14.645
If you lose the next match, I'm willing to forget and forgive.

00:14:15.437 --> 00:14:19.984
If you defy me, you'll become fish food.

00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:33.080
I give up...

00:14:33.205 --> 00:14:37.293
Where did I go wrong to end up with a life like this...?

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:41.005
I'll die either way...

00:14:41.463 --> 00:14:43.841
Hello to all gambling addicts.

00:14:43.966 --> 00:14:45.718
We've finally come this far.

00:14:46.135 --> 00:14:48.804
The finals for the Animacity Baseball League begin now!

00:14:49.221 --> 00:14:52.141
The once foolish but now the star of the slums, the Bears...

00:14:52.558 --> 00:14:56.729
versus the kill-before-killed, butchering vermin corps, Killer Animals!

00:14:56.854 --> 00:14:58.606
If ya don't wanna die...

00:14:59.148 --> 00:15:02.276
Go back home and suck on some honey, little cubs.

00:15:02.401 --> 00:15:03.444
Play ball!

00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:07.281
It's the tanuki girl, full of motivation!

00:15:07.656 --> 00:15:10.993
The mad dog is using a cracked bat, a super bat!

00:15:11.285 --> 00:15:12.870
The tanuki throws either way!

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:18.042
There it is! The shotgun batting!

00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:27.593
Ah! Huh? Huh?

00:15:28.969 --> 00:15:31.096
It's a series of rough plays!

00:15:31.263 --> 00:15:33.349
As expected of Animal Killers!

00:15:37.019 --> 00:15:39.480
Three out! The Bears are showing no resistance.

00:15:39.605 --> 00:15:41.398
Such a lethargic baseball!

00:15:41.774 --> 00:15:43.901
Nngh... Coach!

00:15:44.026 --> 00:15:45.152
...He's gone!

00:15:45.277 --> 00:15:46.612
Hey, what's wrong, everyone?

00:15:46.737 --> 00:15:47.613
Nothing much...

00:15:47.738 --> 00:15:49.657
Aren't you hiding something from me?

00:15:53.369 --> 00:15:57.498
I-I-It's not like we're hiding the fact that we'll get money if we lose.

00:15:57.623 --> 00:15:58.499
Are you dumb?!

00:15:58.832 --> 00:16:00.209
What do you mean?

00:16:00.584 --> 00:16:05.089
If you lose against the Killer Animals, we will give you this.

00:16:06.507 --> 00:16:08.342
Hold on! Are you fixing the game?!

00:16:08.801 --> 00:16:10.636
I dunno if we can win...

00:16:10.761 --> 00:16:12.930
...but we can easily lose.

00:16:13.055 --> 00:16:15.224
Wasn't it your dream to win the championship?

00:16:16.433 --> 00:16:20.062
Getting your sight clouded by money and easily throwing away your dreams...

00:16:20.187 --> 00:16:21.522
How stupid can you be?

00:16:21.939 --> 00:16:23.232
We're stupid either way!

00:16:23.357 --> 00:16:27.277
We've been poor since we were born, and we'll keep being poor!

00:16:27.403 --> 00:16:31.824
What's wrong with getting some money to rise up from a hellhole like that?!

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:53.053
This is Saotome.

00:16:53.178 --> 00:16:56.515
What?! The money from the safe was stolen?!

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.058
Are you stupid?!

00:16:58.183 --> 00:17:00.728
All the money from the gamblers was in there!

00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:02.021
You goddamn fool!

00:17:02.146 --> 00:17:03.939
The money we bet was stolen?!

00:17:04.064 --> 00:17:05.773
What will happen with the money I bet?!

00:17:06.066 --> 00:17:07.026
Give it back!

00:17:07.151 --> 00:17:09.403
Who would watch baseball with no money involved?!

00:17:10.154 --> 00:17:13.073
What happened? The venue is bustling with energy!

00:17:13.198 --> 00:17:15.534
The match has come to a halt!

00:17:29.381 --> 00:17:30.924
The match isn't over yet!

00:17:33.886 --> 00:17:36.430
Are you running with the tail between your legs?

00:17:37.473 --> 00:17:39.558
Are you that afraid of losing?

00:17:41.226 --> 00:17:43.187
Don't be cowards!

00:17:44.521 --> 00:17:49.109
This town's baseball is all about winning, losing, living or dying, isn't it?!

00:17:49.651 --> 00:17:52.529
If that's the case, then go ahead and fight...

00:17:52.654 --> 00:17:54.573
...fair and square, with all your might!

00:18:00.496 --> 00:18:03.499
With this one shot♪

00:18:03.999 --> 00:18:07.544
We'll turn it all around♪

00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:11.131
We Bears♪

00:18:11.256 --> 00:18:14.760
Are the star of the bears♪

00:18:15.969 --> 00:18:17.638
Let's close the gap!

00:18:18.055 --> 00:18:19.098
<i>Yeah!</i>

00:18:20.349 --> 00:18:23.644
You got a nice ball there, don't you, tanuki girl?

00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:29.233
If you manage to dead-ball me, I'll sue you and make society a living hell for you!

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:30.984
Of course!

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:33.445
We don't do killing games here.

00:18:33.904 --> 00:18:35.656
We play baseball!

00:18:35.948 --> 00:18:39.076
Would you look at that! The match continues!

00:18:42.454 --> 00:18:43.914
You...

00:18:44.164 --> 00:18:45.874
Please! Let me go!

00:18:45.999 --> 00:18:49.503
<i>It's a hit! Will it go through?</i>

00:18:49.628 --> 00:18:51.338
<i>They made it! It's a home-run!</i>

00:18:51.463 --> 00:18:54.007
<i>The Bears are cornered by one point!</i>

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:13.735
<i>What a development! Will they turn it around?</i>

00:19:14.111 --> 00:19:16.905
This has become an unprecedented, historical baseball match!

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:20.576
People from all over the city are gathering around to see the match for themselves!

00:19:21.118 --> 00:19:24.204
There's a one-point difference. Killer Animals are in the lead!

00:19:24.329 --> 00:19:26.498
What? C-c-c-coach?!

00:19:26.623 --> 00:19:28.625
Where were you until just now?!

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:31.503
Singing again? I don't wanna bunt!

00:19:31.628 --> 00:19:33.463
Huh? Do it?

00:19:33.589 --> 00:19:36.800
Just do it? Give it your all?

00:19:36.925 --> 00:19:38.844
Do your goddamn best!

00:19:39.261 --> 00:19:42.389
The game starts now! Let's get this win!

00:19:42.848 --> 00:19:46.101
Whoever it was, I'll find them and kill them!

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:49.771
I found it.

00:19:50.147 --> 00:19:51.190
That's yours, isn't it?

00:19:51.315 --> 00:19:53.233
So you're the thief!

00:19:53.358 --> 00:19:54.818
Are you mocking us?!

00:19:58.155 --> 00:20:01.116
I was just nice enough to return it to its owner.

00:20:01.241 --> 00:20:04.244
Or would you rather I report the money I found to the police?

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:07.497
W-why did you bring it?

00:20:07.873 --> 00:20:11.210
I'm also betting. I love baseball.

00:20:16.715 --> 00:20:18.926
That's Michiru Kagemori.

00:20:19.051 --> 00:20:21.678
She's definitely shapeshifting into weird forms.

00:20:21.803 --> 00:20:24.306
I see. Very interesting.

00:20:24.431 --> 00:20:26.433
Game set!

00:20:26.558 --> 00:20:28.310
Killer Animals take the win!

00:20:30.437 --> 00:20:35.067
I never thought losing would be this painful...!

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.360
You did great, Bears!

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:39.279
The losing Bears are being received with a warm applause!

00:20:39.404 --> 00:20:42.407
There hasn't been a match like this in Animacity until now, has there?

00:20:42.532 --> 00:20:48.038
What a moving final match! A final good game!

00:20:48.163 --> 00:20:52.209
Thank you Bears! The stars of the slums, Bears!

00:21:02.511 --> 00:21:04.096
This is your reward.

00:21:04.429 --> 00:21:07.641
So you follow your instructions next time.

00:21:10.769 --> 00:21:12.938
Sorry, but I refuse.

00:21:13.063 --> 00:21:17.150
I don't wanna gamble. I wanna play baseball.

00:21:19.987 --> 00:21:23.282
I couldn't find any evidence of baseball gambling.

00:21:23.699 --> 00:21:25.200
It seems it'll take some time...

00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:27.411
...to change this city.

00:21:31.748 --> 00:21:33.083
Michiru!

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:39.006
I bought a tool to make us better at baseball thanks to the money we got, with a lifetime payment plan!

00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:40.757
Yay!

00:21:41.091 --> 00:21:41.967
Come on, you fools!

00:21:42.634 --> 00:21:44.386
Return that!

00:21:44.511 --> 00:21:46.305
Eh? Why?

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:50.017
Heh... Having fun...?
