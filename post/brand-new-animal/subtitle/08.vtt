WEBVTT

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.270
Yes, it's about whether we should allow the cult to stay.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.900
<i>Well, we have no choice.</i>

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.740
<i>After the uproar from the public...</i>

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.000
...if we don't accept the cult, a riot will be inevitable.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.580
I was saved by them myself.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.250
There's no reason to oppose them.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.330
However... the amount of people who showed up was unexpected.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.300
<i>Around 5,000 people were confirmed to be there.</i>

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.550
They're distributed all over Animacity.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.340
<i>Must be rough for you.</i>

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.680
Well, hang in there.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.060
What's the situation?

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.440
The Beast Factor deactivator has stabilized.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.600
Just one more step.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.480
Good. Keep it up.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.030
Shall we make one final verification?

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.990
♪～

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.920
～♪

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.760
Leader!
<i>Guru!</i>

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.680
It's barely been 3 days since the cult moved into that building...

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.680
That's Ginrou-sama for you.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.810
The power of faith is strong, as they say.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.090
Nazuna!

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.970
Nazuna!

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.430
Would you look at that, you can fly too.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:09.810
Were you hiding it?

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.350
No! Yesterday was a first for me.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.520
You're the one who didn't tell me you could fly.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.230
Do I have to tell you everything?

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.490
That's not what...

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:21.780
Whatever!

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.870
I can't believe you moved right in front of me.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.540
Huh? Boris decided that by himself.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.370
Aside from that, don't tell anyone about my identity.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.830
The fact I'm a human must stay a secret.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.880
I told you I'm not gonna tell anyone.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.380
But I mean, Nazuna, are you...

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.800
...are you okay with this?

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.090
I'm not Nazuna.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.140
Déesse Louve.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.020
I'm not Nazuna. I'm Ms. Déesse Louve.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.490
What language is that? I can't remember that...

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.750
Where did you go?

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.460
To Nazuna's... though she's "not Nazuna" now, apparently.

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:22.720
Did you go see her?

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.590
I just stumbled upon her.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.720
Why? Is that bad?

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.430
No.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.310
Uhm... can I help you?

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.480
I have an investigation on a falcon beastman we caught.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:42.440
Are you coming?

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.660
I think you'd want to know who made the request.

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.700
Are you inviting me?
<i>Yeah.</i>

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:50.870
Really?

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.950
It's okay if you don't want to.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.040
I do! I'm coming!

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.380
Must be a tough task to teach a sinner.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.340
Sinners are the exact people who need to be taught by God.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:07.760
That much is obvious.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.850
He was the chief for the Medical Center...

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.690
He was caught in an embezzlement.

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.810
I don't think he'll misbehave, but be careful.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.530
I don't believe in Ginrou.

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.530
So that's the kind of person you are.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.700
Have I seen you before?

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.000
You can't tell now, can you? Not with this form.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.670
What?

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.880
Let's expose your sin.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.460
I assume you planned on getting away with it...

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.840
...but if the truth came out, President Alan wouldn't just let it slide, would he?

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.680
Y-you...

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.010
Who are you?

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:01.360
That's...

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.110
The trainer from the cult.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.700
Ya-Yaba, what's wrong?

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.160
Are you okay?

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.210
Oh, Michiru's here, too?

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.960
Have you gotten used to this city?

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:27.900
Yeah, I guess...
<i>Oh, you're slurring a bit.</i>

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.930
Inspector! Yaba is breaking out!

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.190
That's Yaba?!

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.650
He's completely different from before!
<i>Yeah.</i>

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.150
You have permission to fire! Do it! Do it!

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.080
Damn it... Why is he so out of control?!

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.040
I'll stop him.

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:02.880
<i>What?
The building is on fire...</i>

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.550
Yes. The outbreak is in progress. The hypothesis is correct.

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.050
I won't let you rage any more!

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.010
Seize him at any cost!

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:14.900
He broke through the fence!

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.890
At this rate, he'll make it to the city!

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:25.860
What?!

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.530
Shirou!

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.990
It's okay, this is nothing...

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:35.700
But, your arm...!

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.040
It fixed itself!

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.760
Oogami having this much trouble, though...

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.340
If that thing makes it to the city... we'll be in big trouble!

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:01.020
What are you doing?!
<i>I'll take care of this!</i>

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.350
I'll take him somewhere with...

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.480
...no people...!

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:07.980
Don't be stupid! Just run!

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:09.110
Shut up!

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:11.940
Don't think you can do everything alone!

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:16.400
I'll help whenever I can...!

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.130
If that's the case... Show me!

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:33.510
Put more force into it!

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:37.850
<i>More force... Then...</i>

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:40.140
<i>...bigger wings!</i>

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:44.850
T-they picked it up!

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.190
Stop moving!

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:48.900
You damn...!

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:50.610
To the wharf!

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:52.860
There shouldn't be any people there!
<i>Got it!</i>

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.530
You're moving again...!

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:02.040
Drop him!
<i>At this height?!</i>

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.710
I don't care, hurry! I'll be fine!

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:06.000
Got it!

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.690
We did it!
<i>Somehow...</i>

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:31.070
...! Get down!

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.570
Sh... Shirou...

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:43.740
Ngh... I'm fine... Run...

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:51.380
S-Shirou!

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:52.840
I'm fine...

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.340
You can't say that with such a wound! We should run!

00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:59.050
We can't leave that guy like that...

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:01.680
That's my responsibility.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:10.190
S... S... Stop it!

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:15.610
Run...!

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.180
I did it!
Shirou, run!

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:01.160
There's no other way...

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:31.440
Ginrou...?

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:33.730
I mean... Shirou?!

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.400
Stay back.

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:08.510
Shirou!

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.480
A-an ambulance!
<i>Stop it.</i>

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:16.400
I'll... be alright...

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:20.780
Oogami!

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:23.280
Mayor! Why are you here?

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.570
Inspector Tachiki called me.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.950
Uh... Shirou is...!

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.910
He will be okay.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.410
Take him to the car.
<i>Understood.</i>

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.920
She found out...

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.130
I see...

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:50.680
He finally calmed down...

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:54.100
The wound is closing, so he's gonna be fine.

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:56.230
That wasn't just a wound...

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:58.360
He's really immortal, huh.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.570
I'm glad you didn't get any major wounds.

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:03.070
It's thanks to Shirou.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.410
Who... What is he?

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:08.950
Shirou is Ginrou?

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:11.870
That's your friend, isn't she?

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:16.670
Don't play dumb, please. I heard Shirou mutter "She found out" just earlier.

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:21.380
Nazuna is a fake Ginrou. You know that, don't you?

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:22.880
Correct.

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:26.800
Is Shirou the real Ginrou?

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:28.840
What will you do with that information?

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:36.060
I... I don't know anything about Shirou.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.270
I never tried to know him, either.

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:44.070
It's probably already decided that Shirou and I are different...

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:46.700
Because he's a beastman and you're a human?

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:50.490
I somehow felt like I could hate Shirou...

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:53.240
...because he hates humans.

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:55.830
That sort of prejudice is...

00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:59.670
...But I'm exactly the same.

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:04.380
...I thought Shirou and I were different because he's a beastman...

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:08.630
When I turned into a beastman, I was scared.

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:13.890
That's probably because I didn't know anything about beastmen.

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:19.400
That's why... I wanna know more about Shirou.

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:22.650
Alright.

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:27.990
A Ginrou with wings, huh...

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.780
That's very godly indeed.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:36.700
But that's just to make the imitation look more gaudy and appealing.

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:38.000
Imitation?

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.630
Shirou Oogami is the real Ginrou.

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:44.300
For the last thousand years.

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:45.960
T-thousand years?!

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:48.590
Has he been living for a thousand years then?!

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.680
Correct.

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.680
He doesn't look that old, though...

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.310
At first sight, at least.

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:57.980
Apparently he stopped aging as soon as he became Ginrou.

00:14:58.350 --> 00:14:59.980
He <i>became</i> Ginrou?

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:03.610
It's not like Oogami was Ginrou since the beginning.

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:07.940
It's a long story.

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:13.950
About a thousand years ago, in the very east of Europe...

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:16.200
There was a city called Nirvasyl.

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:18.830
It was a beastmen-only city...

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:21.670
...like our city, Animacity.

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:27.300
He was living there, like a regular wolf beastman.

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:30.720
At the time, beastmen and humans had trades...

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:35.300
...and friendly relationships even between them.

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:37.770
But one day...

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:39.930
...suddenly, without any warning...

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:43.560
...the human military attacked Nirvasyl.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:52.070
His own kind was slaughtered...

00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:58.080
...and he himself was slain, too...

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:15.930
His body was thrown away like countless others...

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:17.510
...and left to rot.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.690
At that moment, something peculiar happened.

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:51.170
There's no clear reason as to why it happened.

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:54.680
But the blood of all 2,000 Nirvasyl brethren was...

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.850
...what gave him an immortal body.

00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:00.180
He believes so, as well.

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:01.220
That's...

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:04.020
He obtained the power of Ginrou...

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:07.400
...he went in search for the general who killed his kind...

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:11.230
...and in his search, he killed countless human soldiers.

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:15.700
However, he couldn't find the general he was looking for.

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:29.670
When he felt the emptiness left by revenge...

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:33.510
...that's when he became the protector of beastmen.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:37.220
Sometimes protecting them from human oppression...

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:40.600
...and sometimes being the guide for the new world.

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:43.100
And that became the legend of Ginrou...

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:46.600
When we first met...

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:50.360
...was around the final years of World War II.

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:56.320
Wanting to see if they could turn beastmen into biological weapons...

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:58.740
...countries like that existed as well.

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:02.990
In those countries, beastmen were captured and put in concentration camps...

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.200
...and were repeatedly experimented with.

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:20.640
That's when we were saved by Ginrou.

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:27.800
But when he saw the disaster resulting from the experiments beastmen were put through...

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:31.810
...he slaughtered all humans in the research facility.

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:37.690
From then on, he's never once changed into his Ginrou form.

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:45.410
He's afraid of his own power, so he keeps Ginrou sealed away.

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:49.870
So please don't tell anyone he's Ginrou. Do you understand?

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.100
I don't get it.

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:56.300
I don't really get it.

00:18:56.420 --> 00:19:00.050
So I'll just keep things as they are.

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:03.970
To me, he's Shirou Oogami.

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:08.890
That cold and unfriendly person who desperately fights to protect Animacity.

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:13.060
Hehe. Right. That's okay.

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:16.020
No... That's perfect.

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:18.400
Yeah.

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:23.870
Since I survived, I aimed to become a scientist.

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:29.660
I figured humans couldn't be the only ones to know about beastmen. Beastmen should know, too.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.460
This little guy was at that lab, too.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.460
He's a crow who got his body reconstructed.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.460
That's why he's been living for so long.

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:44.260
He was saved along with me.

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:48.470
Uhm... I'll keep it quiet.

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:52.640
I'll keep the fact that Shirou is Ginrou to myself.

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:54.270
But...

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:58.070
...the fact that Ginrou is actually real...

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:00.740
...I have someone I want to tell that to.

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:03.910
Please.

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:07.330
What would he say...?

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:09.120
<i>I don't mind.</i>

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.330
Shirou!

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:14.330
Go.

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.090
Yeah!

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:22.590
Are you sure?

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.090
If we stopped her, she'd talk either way.

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:30.100
Heh. Seems like you're starting to understand her.

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:32.560
She's really good at manipulating me.

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:39.270
I'll go, too. I have something I'm interested in.

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:50.910
Michiru...

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.710
Well, if it isn't the Mayor.

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.630
Show me the scan data.
<i>B-but...</i>

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:09.050
I don't mind.
<i>Ah, but...</i>

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:13.060
You know, don't you? Before she became the Mayor...

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:16.310
...she was the first person ever to research the Beast Factor.

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:21.280
She was the first beastman to get a PhD.

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:25.740
W-what's this shift in the Beast Factor?!

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:28.370
That's right. We're investigating that as well.

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:32.660
I trust you'll contact me as soon as there is any progress?

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:34.160
With pleasure.

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:38.250
Having the top of Sylvasta Pharmaceutics here is reassuring.

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.670
If anything happens, I trust you'll handle it immediately.

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.630
That is why I'm here.

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:50.350
That's right. That's exactly why.
